SEOUL: In the South Korean city of Asan this week, residents held angry protests decrying their government’s decision to quarantine South Koreans evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the growing outbreak of a new coronavirus, at a facility in their community. Among the many placards at the protest -- hung between pieces of heavy construction equipment to block the road to the facilities -- was one that read “Asan citizens first.” Protest signs are meant to convey simple, snappy messages and don’t have room for much context. But it was clear from this slogan that the people of Asan felt that their government should put them first, that they shouldn’t have to forego any of their interests, or risk their own health, to accommodate fellow citizens fleeing the hub of a public health crisis. In explaining their opposition, locals have said that the government picked Asan, and another city called Jincheon, as the quarantine sites without consulting them first. They have also pointed out that the quarantine facilities are in densely populated areas, where many children live. NOT IN MY BACKYARD Social scientists have dubbed this way of thinking NIMBYism, with NIMBY being the acronym for “not in my backyard,” a phenomenon whereby people in a certain location resist some change to the place that they live on no grounds other than that the proposed change, while being necessary or at least beneficial in a general sense for the wider society, isn’t good for their specific community or locality. Pretty much everyone can agree that a country must have garbage dumps and sewage treatment facilities, yet no one wants those facilities near where they live because of the adverse effects on property values and quality of life. The locals in Asan were not arguing that their fellow South Koreans should be banned from returning to their country or that the national government had no responsibility to help get them out of Wuhan. They simply, for entirely selfish reasons, want them sent elsewhere.   Curiously absent from this display of fiery dissent in Asan was any suggestion of what to do with the roughly 700 returnees. No South Korean city was likely to raise its hand and volunteer to host hundreds of people who could have been exposed to the deadly, poorly understood virus at this stage of the outbreak, when the number of cases is rising daily and no one knows how bad the outbreak could get. One might have expected that at this stage, cities would be willing to step forward and contribute to the state’s handling of the public health crisis, to shoulder risk and burden as a way of working toward a solution. A NEW FACE OF SOCIETY This case contrasts sharply with a heart-warming story of South Korean cooperation and sacrifice not too long ago. In 1998, as the country was reeling from the Asian Financial Crisis and the national government was billions of dollars in debt, citizens lined up to donate gold to help the nation climb out of debt. That story was upheld as demonstration of a deep social bond, of citizens willing to, at a time of economic disaster, give up personal assets to help out the country. Would anything like that happen today? South Koreans have long lamented that that same crisis in the late 1990s changed their country forever, introducing neoliberal economics, eroding the country’s previous model of jobs for life and family-like companies. The crisis paved the way for a more competitive, individualistic South Korea where nothing is guaranteed and average citizens, like those who protested in Asan this week, see their society’s elites as corrupt and out of touch. FOR THE WIDER GOOD South Korea is a democracy, and democracies require a peculiar balancing of individual rights and collective goals.   Citizens have a role to play in picking their leaders and agitating for policy decisions, but there are limits on what they can achieve. At some point, all citizens are asked to grit their teeth and accept things they may not like. In democracies, anyone who fulfils a duty to their state that requires they risk their own life -- career soldiers, police officers, emergency workers -- does so with their own consent. The preamble to South Korea’s constitution states, the provision of “equal opportunities to every person and provide for the fullest development of individual capabilities” as a goal. Unfortunately there is a contradiction in that, as at some point, particular individuals must sacrifice for collective well-being. LESSONS FROM THE PAST As the first chartered flight carrying 368 Koreans from Wuhan landed at the Gimpo International Airport on Friday (Jan 31) morning amidst continued anger among some residents in Asan and Jincheon, I couldn’t help but ponder about how this could messy situation could have been averted or resolved. A potentially effective solution during a dispute like this is a show of leadership, for someone in a position of responsibility to set an example for the concerned citizens of Asan by showing that they are willing to take on some of the burden. Or for someone to show by example – which in this case would have been one of the cities putting up its hands to say they would welcome their evacuated fellow citizens to be quarantined in their neighbourhood. On the other hand, the government has acted more decisively than the last time an epidemic hit the nation – the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2015 – by putting into quarantine and issuing medical assistance to infected persons early while also announcing that it will be drawing from an emergency fund to contain the virus as it aims to calm residents and investors.   But it can still do better. Specifically, in this case of quarantining the evacuated Koreans, it ought to clearly communicate that the authorities are working actively to contain the corona virus outbreak, and has learned lessons about the need for strict quarantine from the MERS experience, when the government garnered criticism for failing to quarantine people who had been exposed to the virus. For now, the protests appear to have simmered down as the residents of Asan reportedly came to a decision to back down after an hour-long meeting on Friday. But with more than 300 Koreans left to be evacuated from Wuhan, the unrest may yet get new life in the coming days. This makes the communication from government an ongoing effort to ease citizens’ worries. Political leadership handbooks also point to the importance of empathy, of leaders demonstrating that they care how their citizens feel. Asan citizens might feel more at ease if President Moon Jae-in came to their community to walk the city streets and listen to people’s concerns. At the very least, that would allow Moon’s government to send the key message: We’re all in this together.

The South Asian nation last week evacuated 312 people, mostly students, from the epicentre of the deadly outbreak, and had planned a second flight for another 171 Bangladeshis. "We can't bring them because we can't send any flight," Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen told reporters on Saturday (Feb 9). "No crew wants to go there. The crew who went there earlier don't want to go either." The outbreak, which has killed more than 800 people and infected tens of thousands across China, has spread to nearly more than two dozen other countries and sparked global concern. There have been no cases recorded in Bangladesh. The evacuees and aircrew who returned to Dhaka on Feb 1 are being quarantined for 14 days at a camp usually used for Haj pilgrims. Health officials say none have tested positive for the virus. The minister said the government was trying to charter a Chinese flight instead, but so far without success.

- Date: 27 Jan 2020 11:56AM 27 Jan 2020 11:11PM- Title: Wuhan virus: Increased border checks, leave of absence among new counter-measures- cases: meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: A new set of stringent measures will be introduced in Singapore's efforts to contain the Wuhan coronavirus, a newly formed multi-ministry task force announced on Monday (Jan 27). The task force is co-chaired by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong. Among other measures, Mr Wong announced at a media conference that people should defer all non-essential travel to mainland China, an extension from an earlier advisory to defer all travel to Hubei. "We are doing this now because of the latest developments in China which the China government itself has described as grave and they have also said the virus is getting stronger and infections will continue to rise," said Mr Wong. Given Singapore's status as an international transport hub, Mr Wong said this extended travel advisory is a necessary safeguard against further spread of the virus.  ENHANCED TEMPERATURE SCREENING Authorities will also strengthen border measures by implementing temperature screening for all incoming flights by Wednesday, Mr Wong said. Thermal scanners will be deployed at the piers of the airport to cover all incoming flights, he added. Currently, temperature screening is only conducted for passengers on flights from China at air checkpoints. Temperature screening will continue at land checkpoints for bus, car and train arrivals and at sea checkpoints. There will also be additional attention given to flights from mainland China at the aerobridge. These include visual identification of unwell travellers for evaluation by the medical team. Travellers deemed unwell with fever or respiratory symptoms, or have relevant travel history to Hubei, will be referred to nursing stations. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) will also check passengers with passports issued in Hubei. Such passengers will be referred for medical attention to ensure that they are well, and to obtain their contact details to expedite subsequent contact tracing if required. MEASURES FOR WORKFORCE, STUDENTS There will also be "extra precautions" taken for the workforce and students and teachers returning from mainland China, Mr Wong said. For students and school employees returning from China, they will be given a leave of absence for 14 days to minimise close contact with others. The minister said organisations have been advised to collect health and travel declarations from employees returning from mainland China from Tuesday. "We are doing this now, we are getting ready now because we fully expect more to come back after the Chinese New Year holidays," he added. More stringent precautions are in place for organisations with staff who have close contact and sustained interactions with vulnerable populations. These include pre-schools and healthcare and eldercare facilities. Employers in these sectors will have to issue a leave of absence for 14 days upon their workers' return to Singapore from mainland China. "We will put this measure in place for all government-operated and government-funded entities in these three sectors. For private employers, the relevant government agencies will be following up with them to get this measure implemented," said Mr Wong. The general workforce is recommended to follow these measures as well. Employers may adopt additional precautionary measures if they choose to do so. Mr Wong said: "We have no evidence that there is community spread of the virus in Singapore. But it may happen. And if it does we stand ready to take additional measures. "I want to assure Singaporeans that we will do everything we can to protect Singaporeans and Singapore, but this does not mean overreacting or worse, turning xenophobic. We must be proactive and rational in our response and base our actions on the available evidence and data," the minister added. The most important defence against the virus is still at the individual level, he said, adding that it is not enough for the Government to act alone.   Mr Wong said he is unable to give a figure yet on the number of individuals who have travelled to Singapore after visiting Hubei province and remained here before China's travel restrictions came into force. "These need not only be China nationals. There will be Singaporeans, people from other nationalities," he said, adding that authorities are currently reaching out to them. "Some of them would have left already. And so we are contacting them to make sure that they are in good health, and if they show symptoms, immediately report to the doctor and monitor their status. "We will provide an update on this in due course."  Singapore has so far confirmed four cases of the SARS-like virus - the fourth was announced early Sunday morning. The first case of the novel coronavirus in Singapore was announced on Thursday, while two cases were confirmed on Friday. Contact tracing has been activated for confirmed cases and as a precautionary step, government quarantine facilities have been set up to house close contacts who are well. The Ministry of Health said there were no new confirmed cases of the Wuhan virus in Singapore as of noon on Sunday, adding that it has been notified of 92 suspected cases in total. Of the 92 people, 46 have tested negative for the coronavirus. Test results for the remaining 42 people are pending.

- Date: 01 Feb 2020 07:35PM 03 Feb 2020 11:13PM- Title: Wuhan coronavirus: 2 new imported cases, no evidence of community spread, says MOH- cases: meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Saturday (Feb 1) confirmed two additional imported cases of the Wuhan coronavirus, bringing the total to 18 cases. Both cases have recent travel history to Wuhan and there is currently no evidence of community spread in Singapore, MOH added. "The two new cases are stable currently, and we are continuing to monitor their health. As for the 16 previously announced cases, none is critically ill. All of them remain in stable condition, and most are improving," MOH said. The 17th case is a 47-year-old female Singapore citizen who travelled to Wuhan. "She was one of the Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30, and arrived in Singapore on the same day. She was asymptomatic when she boarded the flight. "Upon arrival at Changi Airport, she was found to have a fever during medical screening, and was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID)," MOH said. The woman then tested positive for Wuhan coronavirus infection on Jan 31 at about 11pm. She is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID. The 18th case is a 31-year-old female Chinese national who arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 22. She tested positive for infection on Feb 1 at about 2pm and is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID. MOH said that it has initiated epidemiological investigations and contact tracing to identify individuals who had close contact with the cases. In an update on the 16th confirmed case, which was announced on Jan 31, MOH said the 38-year-old male Chinese national arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 22. He is currently warded in an isolation room at the Singapore General Hospital. The man reported that he was asymptomatic during his flight to Singapore and subsequently developed symptoms on Jan 23. He reported that he had stayed at his home at Nathan Road until Jan 29, when he took a taxi to SGH. He was classified as a suspect case and immediately isolated. Subsequent test results confirmed 2019-nCoV infection on Jan 31 at about 2pm, MOH said.  As of 12pm on Feb 1, MOH said 231 of the suspect cases have tested negative for the Wuhan coronavirus. Test results for the remaining 25 cases are pending and contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once identified, MOH said it will closely monitor all close contacts and quarantine them for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient as a precautionary measure. All other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status. So far, MOH said it has identified 245 close contacts. Of the 177 who are still in Singapore, 172 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining five close contacts.  MOH also advised Singaporeans to defer all travel to Hubei province and all non-essential travel to mainland China. "All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell. "Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (eg. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit," MOH said.  MOH added that it will continue to monitor the situation closely. "As medical practitioners are on the lookout for cases with pneumonia who have recently been in China, Singapore is likely to see more suspect cases that will need to be investigated." Singapore on Friday announced that it will widen travel restrictions to include all new visitors with recent travel history to China. China also said it will send charter planes to bring home citizens from Hubei who are overseas "as soon as possible". The announcement came as a number of airlines, including Singapore Airlines and Scoot, announced they were halting or reducing flights to China as the country tackles the spread of the virus. In a bid to contain the possible spread of the virus, a total of 967 students and employees from schools in Singapore have been placed on leave of absence because of their recent travel history to China. On Saturday, authorities began distributing packs of four surgical masks for each Singapore household. There have been long queues for masks at pharmacies and retailers across the country.  Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing on Thursday reassured people that Singapore will have enough masks, provided the supply is managed "appropriately".

- Date: 02 Feb 2020 04:24PM 03 Feb 2020 12:53AM- Title: Wuhan coronavirus: Licence fees waived for hotels, travel agents and tour guides, cleaning costs subsidised- cases: meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Licence fees for hotels, travel agents and tour guides will be waived as part of measures to help the tourism sector in Singapore that has been “directly affected” by the Wuhan coronavirus, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) said on Sunday (Feb 2). STB will also defray the cleaning costs of hotels that provided accommodation to the confirmed and suspected cases of the coronavirus infections. These schemes are the first steps in a wider set of measures to help tourism businesses “mitigate the immediate impact” of the coronavirus outbreak, STB added.   These measures come after feedback from trade associations and chambers, said Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing. He said at the Oasia Hotel Downtown: "I just want to assure the businesses and our workers that the survival of the businesses, and in the turn, the sustainability of the jobs for Singaporeans will be our primary focus." Oasia Hotel Downtown was where Singapore's 13th confirmed case of the Wuhan virus stayed prior to being tested positive for the coronavirus. The 73-year-old arrived in Singapore on Jan 21 and developed symptoms seven days later. Mr Chan told reporters that Singaporeans should be "mentally prepared" for the impact of the coronavirus to be "wider, deeper and longer" than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. This is because China's trade with Singapore and its GDP have both gone up four times since then. "What we must be mentally prepared for is that the impact of any disruption to the Chinese economy, to the supply chains, is likely to be much wider, much deeper, because of the interlinkages with the global economy - certainly with the Singapore economy," he said.   "The tourism sector has already been directly affected by the novel coronavirus, due to a decline in visitor arrivals, especially from China," STB said in its media release on Sunday. Tourists from China account for about 20 per cent of Singapore’s total international visitor arrivals, with about 3.6 million visitors to Singapore in 2019, the tourism board added. Earlier this week, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong announced wider travel restrictions to include all new visitors – regardless of nationality – with recent travel history to China. These visitors will also not be allowed to transit in Singapore, as part of restrictions that came into effect at 11.59pm on Saturday. Those with Chinese passports, with the exception of Singapore permanent residents (PRs) and long-term pass holders, will also not be allowed to enter Singapore. All forms of new visas to Chinese passport holders have been suspended, and Singapore’s status as a visa-free transit facility has also been suspended for those with Chinese passports. HELP WITH CLEANING AND LICENCE FEES There have been 18 confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore. Of the 18, 16 are travellers from Wuhan and two are Singaporeans who were evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30. The tourism board said hotels that provided accommodation to suspected and confirmed cases will get help with their environmental cleaning and disinfection costs. “STB will cover up to 50 per cent of third-party professional cleaning fees, capped at S$20,000 per establishment for hotels with confirmed cases; and S$10,000 per establishment for hotels with suspected cases,” the board added. This will be backdated to Jan 23, when the first confirmed case in Singapore was detected. Licence fees for hotels for the rest of 2020 will also be waived by the Hotels Licensing Board. “Similarly, travel agents and tourist guides whose licences are due for renewal in 2020 will not need to pay to renew their licence fees,” STB said. Chief executive of STB Keith Tan said: "Over the past week, STB has been in close contact with our tourism partners to understand their difficulties and to assess the impact. "We know the situation is likely to persist, and recognise we need to move quickly to support the industry and build confidence. "STB will continue to identify targeted and effective ways to support the tourism industry so that they are well-positioned to grow swiftly once we start to recover." Full details of the overall package of relief measures will be announced at Budget 2020 on Feb 18.   The Government is "keenly aware" that some front-line workers are "particularly worried" about coming into contact with unwell guests or customers, added Manpower Minister Josephine Teo. She said that the Singapore National Employers Federation and the Singapore Business Federation will issue an advisory to employers with such workers. "(The advisory will explain) what they can do to provide these workers with support. They need guidance on how to deal with unwell customers, and the advisory will give some specific suggestions," she said. Workers who are placed on leave of absences are not unwell and should not be evicted by landlords, co-tenants or dormitory operators, added Mrs Teo. There have been reports of such evictions, Communications and Information Minister S Iswaran had said on Friday. "There's really no need to do so. It is completely unhelpful. And this is a time where we actually need to provide care and support to each other," Mrs Teo said. She noted that placing workers on leave is an extra precaution to minimise social contact. "We must always be mindful that even as we take these extra precautions, we should be supportive to the people who are affected by the leave of absence," she said.

- Date: 31 Jan 2020 06:06PM 31 Jan 2020 11:26PM- Title: Wuhan coronavirus: Singapore to widen travel restrictions to all new visitors who recently travelled to mainland China- cases: meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: In an effort to minimise the risk of community spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, new visitors of any nationality with recent travel history to mainland China will not be allowed to enter Singapore, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said on Friday (Jan 31). These visitors will also not be allowed to transit in Singapore, as part of restrictions that will come into effect at 11.59pm on Saturday. Those with Chinese passports, with the exception of Singapore permanent residents (PRs) and long-term pass holders, will also not be allowed to enter Singapore. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) will, with immediate effect, suspend the issuance of all forms of new visas to those with Chinese passports. Singapore's status as a visa-free transit facility will be suspended for Chinese passport holders. Previously issued short-term and multiple-visit visas for those with Chinese passports will also be suspended. Those who hold such visas will not be allowed into Singapore during this period.   In a press release on Friday evening, the Manpower Ministry also announced that with immediate effect, it will reject all new work pass applications for foreign workers from mainland China until further notice. Renewal applications for existing work pass holders will not be affected.  Earlier this week, the restrictions only applied to new visitors who had recently travelled to China's Hubei province. However, China recently announced that the number of reported infections in the country had doubled since Jan 28 to more than 9,000 and that the likelihood of widespread community transmission in other parts of China is now high. "As a result, we are likely to see a sharper rise in the local transmission of the virus in Chinese cities beyond the Hubei province in the coming days," said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a press release on Friday. At the briefing, Mr Wong also said that Singapore residents with recent travel history to mainland China will be issued a travel advisory and asked to take a 14-day leave of absence. These include Singapore citizens, PRs as well as those with long-term passes. Commissioner of ICA Marvin Sim, who was at the briefing, said the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore will be disseminating the information to all airlines to ensure smooth implementation of the new measures. Cabin crew who have to travel to China as part of their job will not be subject to the new measures, but in consultation with the Health Ministry, will have to take precautionary measures, he said. They will only be able to enter or transit if they are well, he added. “These additional travel restrictions on top of all that we have already introduced over the past few days will enable us to limit the number of new cases here and to reduce the risk of community spread in Singapore,” said Mr Wong, who co-chairs a ministerial task force set up to deal with the coronavirus situation. Responding to a question from the media, Mr Wong stressed that the restrictions are not nationality-based. "It is not a nationality issue," he said. "The motivation is the origins of the virus and that beyond Hubei, the virus is now spreading to other parts of China - as we have said, there is assessment that this is happening." When asked for a clarification that all Chinese passport holders who are not residents of Singapore will be barred from Singapore regardless of their previous travel, Mr Wong said: "This is the policy because it is difficult to know your previous travel history." At the operational level, there may be appeals," he added. The passport is being used as a "proxy", he said. "I can imagine somebody may say 'I’m a passport holder, but I have not be in China all this while'. I think we can take that separate from the policy, and at the operational level, ICA will have to deal with these instances," he said.  Meanwhile, MOH's director of medical services Kenneth Mak said there remains no evidence of community spread. Of those suspected of having the coronavirus, 164 of them have been ruled out while test results are still pending for 49 others. “The situation remains fluid, it is constantly changing. We do not rule out taking further measures,” Mr Wong said.

- Date: 24 Jan 2020 05:59PM 24 Jan 2020 11:50PM- Title: Wuhan virus in Singapore: What can you do?- cases: meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners  SINGAPORE: Doctors have urged members of the public to remain calm and observe proper hygiene practices, as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Singapore rose to three on Friday (Jan 24). This includes wearing masks when unwell and practising proper hand washing, they told CNA. As of Friday, the number of suspected cases had climbed to 44, with patients aged between one to 78, according to the Health Ministry. At least 25 deaths had been reported in China as of Friday, with more than 830 confirmed cases of the virus. Cases have also been confirmed in Japan, Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the United States.  Below are some guidelines on how to respond to the Wuhan virus situation in Singapore, according to medical professionals. 1. DON'T PANIC Members of the public should stay calm, said infectious diseases expert Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang. “Because the Wuhan coronavirus is currently not spreading in Singapore, people should not panic and overreact,” said Assoc Prof Hsu, who is programme leader of infectious diseases and co-director of global health at the National University of Singapore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. “There is no need to stockpile masks, for example. The Ministry of Health, which has learned critical lessons from the various outbreaks that afflicted Singapore including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), will issue appropriate guidance and information in a timely manner,” he added. Instead, people should keep abreast of the situation, put on masks when they feel unwell, wash their hands properly and avoid travel to Hubei province, which is the epicentre of the crisis. 2. WEAR A SURGICAL MASK Infectious diseases expert Dr Leong Hoe Nam urged people to use a surgical mask instead of an N95 mask. “A surgical mask works both ways. It can prevent transmission from others to you and from you to others,” he said. When worn, the mask should cover the nose and mouth and rest on the chin, he added. It is important for the mask to fit well, he said. The mask can be used until it is wet inside. Once wet, it should be replaced with a new one. This means that a dry mask can be used again, Dr Leong said. He advised users to keep it in a bag without deforming it. He cautioned that drying a mask in the open could allow the germs to spread in the air. Wearing an N95 mask could be counter-productive as users might touch their faces more often from discomfort, spreading viruses on their hands, he said.   3. WASH HANDS THOROUGHLY Head of primary care at Healthway Medical Dr John Cheng said the use of anti-bacterial and alcohol-based soaps is recommended. “This is especially when coming into contact with common exchanged items such as money and utensils, and items such as handrails and lift buttons,” he said. Using hand sanitisers is as effective, he added. According to Singapore’s HealthHub, proper hand washing means washing hands for at least 30 seconds with soap and water. “The constant rubbing action helps soap break down the grease and dirt that carry most germs. This way, your hands don’t just smell fresh, but you’ll also reduce the germ count on your hands by up to 99 per cent,” according to the website. The recommended eight-step hand-washing routine includes cleaning between fingers, the base of thumbs and fingernails. If there is no soap available, Dr Leong said that water alone could be effective as it can also break down viruses. 4. VACCINATIONS While there is no vaccination available for the Wuhan virus, Dr Leong said that the general public being vaccinated against influenza will reduce the risk of them from falling sick. This will reduce the burden on the healthcare system and prevent distraction from people who need attention more urgently, he added. Dr Cheng said that aside from the influenza vaccine to protect an individual against influenza-based infections, it is also important to have all other vaccinations up-to-date to safeguard your general health and immunity. These include vaccines for hepatitis A, B, typhoid, region-specific vaccines and pneumonia vaccines. “This is important especially for the elderly and immunocompromised patients,” he said.

- Date: 31 Jan 2020 05:01PM 31 Jan 2020 09:46PM- Title: Wuhan coronavirus: 1,500 SAF personnel packing 5.2m masks in 24-hour operation- cases: meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: A total of 1,500 Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) personnel are packing 5.2 million surgical masks for distribution to the public, as Singapore continues its fight against the Wuhan coronavirus. The round-the-clock packing operation at the SAFTI Military Institute started on Thursday (Jan 30) evening after the multi-ministerial task force announced that each Singapore household will receive a pack of four masks. The SAF will use large vans and operational utility vehicles to deliver the masks to 89 Residents' Committee centres and Community Centres, after which the People's Association (PA) will distribute them to the public.  The SAF personnel are working eight-hour shifts, with each shift expected to pack 200,000 masks. They will aim to deliver the first batch of masks on Friday evening and finish the operation by Saturday evening.   Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said the SAF is “very aware” that all agencies in Singapore have to “lean forward” to do its part in tackling the Wuhan coronavirus. “Every new biological outbreak can be very serious if we are not quick enough to take up the right measures,” he told reporters at the packing area on Friday. This comes as Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said on Thursday that there is a sufficient supply of masks in Singapore if managed properly, amid concerns over a lack of availability at retailers islandwide. Many people in Singapore are donning surgical masks as a form of protection against the coronavirus, although experts have cautioned it could create a "false sense of security" if not used properly. FACTORY LINE On Friday, 450 servicemen wearing gloves, masks and hair nets sat at rows of tables in a large hall – chosen for its sterile environment and proximity to a transport line. Servicemen who leave the hall have to sanitise their hands before returning to the tables. They removed masks from a small box and placed four of them in a Ziploc bag. These then go into a larger carton that can contain 400 of such bags. Each van can carry up to 14,000 bags.   Other servicemen help to pack the large cartons and move them to vehicles waiting outside. After this 8am shift ends at 4pm, another will take over. The SAF personnel include non-uniformed staff as well as full-time national servicemen and regulars from the Combat Service Support Command. Dr Ng said the servicemen took a few hours after being activated to prepare the entire set-up, including getting materials like masks, ziploc bags and packing boxes from various agencies. Nevertheless, he said the servicemen were “on track” with their progress, adding that they were in good spirits.   “You know that when you do this, you’re doing it to protect your family and fellow Singaporeans, and you’re very proud of it,” he stated. It is not the first time the SAF is conducting such an operation – during the haze crisis in 2013, it packed and distributed more than 1 million masks to the public through the PA. CONTACT TRACING, TEMPERATURE SCREENING The SAF is also helping out in other areas of the battle against the Wuhan coronavirus. Dr Ng said that as part of contact tracing, SAF personnel are making a hundred calls a day to people in Singapore who have travelled to Hubei province recently to ask about their condition. They are also manning thermal imagery equipment at airports and will inform airport staff if they detect symptomatic passengers. The minister stressed that these SAF personnel are not in direct contact with passengers, adding that they were not trained to do so.   Dr Ng had also said in a Facebook post on Thursday that the SAF is using its premises for quarantine cases. On Friday, he said the SAF is “careful” to ensure it maintains operational readiness even as it deploys resources to contain the Wuhan coronavirus. “Even though it’s a national effort, we want to make sure that the SAF keeps its eye on its primary responsibility,” he said. “We will not compromise security, even though this is important, and that is why we mobilised the Combat Service Support Command, whereas other operational units are still on tasking.” When asked if there are SAF servicemen currently in China, Dr Ng said the SAF has instructed personnel to defer non-essential travel to the country, adding that there were also no upcoming bilateral exercises with China. "Even if (the trip to China is) important, they have to get clearance," he added.

"We can confirm that a 60-year-old US citizen diagnosed with coronavirus died at a hospital in Wuhan, China, on Feb 6," an embassy spokesman told AFP on Saturday (Feb 8), without specifying the person's gender. "We offer the sincerest condolences to the family for their loss," the spokesman said, adding that no further comment would be made out of respect for the family's privacy. The Japanese foreign ministry in a statement on Saturday also said that one of its citizens with a suspected coronavirus infection has died in a hospital in the Chinese city. The man in his 60s had been hospitalised due to severe pneumonia and the hospital reported his death to the Japanese embassy in China, the ministry said in a statement. Chinese medical authorities said the man was highly likely to have been infected with the new coronavirus but "it is difficult to make a definitive judgment", the statement said. His cause of death was given as viral pneumonia, it added. These latest cases would be the first confirmed foreign deaths in China from the outbreak. Two people have died from the virus outside the mainland: A man from Wuhan in the Philippines and a 39-year-old man in Hong Kong. At least 722 people have died from the virus in China while more than 34,000 have been infected, according to the latest official figures. The Chinese foreign ministry said on Thursday that 19 foreigners have been infected in China, and two of them have recovered. The ministry refused to disclose their nationalities.

Another death was reported in Chongqing, bringing the total number of new deaths in the country to 46. In its daily update, the provincial health commission also said newly confirmed cases of infection in Hubei continued to grow at a steady pace, with 1,347. Nationwide there were 2,102 new cases as of Jan 31. That puts the national total at 11,791 as of Jan 31, according to the National Health Commission. Most of the country's deaths and overall cases have been in Hubei, a populous province in China's centre. The top Communist Party official in Wuhan, the central city of 11 million people where the virus first emerged in December, on Friday expressed "remorse" because local authorities acted too slowly. The virus is believed to have emerged in December in the provincial capital of Wuhan in a meat market that sold wild game. Last week, China's central government finally jumped into action, effectively sealing off Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province, and curbing travel across the nation of 1.4 billion people. But the epidemic has spread far and wide as Chinese people travelled across the country and abroad over the Chinese New Year holiday that started last week. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a global health emergency, but said it was not recommending any international trade or travel restrictions. It has since ballooned into a global health emergency with cases in more than 20 countries. Countries have scrambled to evacuate their nationals from Wuhan, with hundreds of US, Japanese, British, French and South Korean citizens evacuated so far, and more countries planning airlifts. A flight carrying more than 300 Indian nationals left Wuhan in the early hours of Saturday for New Delhi. About 200 US evacuees who landed in California on Wednesday have been put under a rare mandatory quarantine order for 14 days. US carriers American, United and Delta joined other airlines suspending flights to China, following the State Department travel advisory. Russia said it would evacuate more than 2,500 of its citizens holidaying on China's Hainan island, far from the epicentre of the outbreak, a day after sealing its remote far-eastern border.

"Ninety-two Singaporeans will arrive in Singapore from Wuhan, Hubei via Scoot flight TR121 this morning," said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) in a press statement on Thursday. The plane departed Wuhan for Singapore at about 7am and landed in Singapore at about 11.40am, according to Scoot. Separately, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong told reporters that some Singaporeans are unable to come back because they are already symptomatic. He said it was "not safe" for them to be on the same plane as the 92 Singaporeans who returned home on Thursday morning. "But in any case, I think the vast majority of them are already back, and they are not symptomatic, but to be safe, all of them will be subject to quarantine," Mr Wong added. "The ones who are remaining ... our embassy is in touch with all of them, to ensure their welfare, to ensure that they're okay. "Some are symptomatic and they may well have to stay quarantined in China itself, but we are in touch with all of them. "I don't have the numbers off hand but there are not that many – vast majority are already back." TEMPERATURE SCREENING, CHECKS CONDUCTED Scoot had suspended its Singapore-Wuhan return flights from Jan 23 to Mar 29, after Chinese authorities locked down the Hubei province. The airline had organised a flight from Singapore to Wuhan on Wednesday night to fly back some of the passengers who wanted to return to Wuhan but were affected by the cancellations. The flight landed in Wuhan Tianhe International Airport at about 3am on Thursday. MFA consular officers accompanied the flight to "facilitate the ground operations at Wuhan", the ministry said. To ensure the safety of employees and passengers, temperature screening was conducted at check-in and before boarding, said Scoot in a statement. "Any passengers found to be febrile would not have been allowed to board," said Scoot. Surgical masks were provided to all passengers and all operating crew members were required to wear N95 masks and surgical gloves on board the flights. The flight operated with "limited in-flight service", with no distribution of food and drink or sale of duty-free products. Food packs were pre-placed on the seats, said the airline. "This greatly limited the physical interactions between passengers and crew," it said. The aircraft was disinfected in Wuhan before passengers boarded the flight home, and the plane was again disinfected upon arrival in Singapore. MFA said the returning Singaporeans will undergo medical screening when they arrive at Changi Airport. Those with fever or respiratory symptoms will be taken to designated hospitals for further examination, while the remaining passengers - including the consular officers - will be quarantined for 14 days. In a telephone call with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Wednesday, Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan expressed the Government's appreciation to China's government, the Hubei provincial government, the Wuhan city government, and the Chinese Embassy in Singapore for "facilitating the safe return of these Singaporeans", said MFA. "Glad to know that 92 Singaporeans from Wuhan have returned this morning," Dr Balakrishnan said in a Facebook post. "MFA officers in Beijing have been in regular communication with them since the city was locked down a week ago. We will always look out for Singaporeans in distress overseas."   "THEIR ORDEAL IS OVER" Welcoming the 92 Singaporeans home, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan praised the "dedication and sacrifice of many agencies and colleagues" who helped facilitate the flights. He thanked the Scoot pilots and crew and officers from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, Changi Airport Group, Immigrations and Checkpoints Authority and Ministry of Health. "Scoot TR121 from Wuhan which touched down this morning at Changi is special," said Mr Khaw in a Facbook post. "It carried the 92 Singaporeans who were stuck in Wuhan when (the People's Republic of China) decided to lock down the city. You can imagine their anxiety and fear! "Their ordeal is over, though we have to put them under quarantine for 14 days."  Also writing on Facebook, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and NTUC Secretary-General Ng Chee Meng said he "couldn't be more proud" of Scoot staff union leaders and members for stepping forward "to serve our fellow Singaporeans without hesitation". "It warmed my heart to know that when Scoot management asked for volunteers to staff a flight to Wuhan Tianhe International Airport, there were more volunteers than was needed," he said, praising the pilots and crew who flew to Wuhan and back. "Thank you to all parties who worked hard in helping to bring home Singaporeans who had been unable to come home due to travel bans," he added.  DEATH TOLL IN CHINA CLIMBS The return of the 92 Singaporeans on Thursday comes as the death toll from the coronavirus hit 170 in China, with more than 7,700 people infected in the country. The vast majority of these cases were in the Hubei province, where the first cases of the virus were reported. Foreign governments have been flying their citizens out of the area, as the number of deaths jumped and the World Health Organization voiced "grave concern" about person-to-person spread in three other countries. In Singapore, 10 people are confirmed to have the coronavirus so far, with the latest three cases announced on Wednesday. The authorities have announced measures to contain the virus, including restrictions on visitors who have travelled to Hubei recently and visitors who hold passports issued in Hubei province. They have also implemented temperature screening for all incoming flights and a compulsory leave of absence for students and teachers returning from China.

- Date: 01 Feb 2020 06:01AM 01 Feb 2020 11:55PM- Title: FAQ: Wuhan coronavirus and its outbreak- cases: meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners CNA enlisted the help of medical experts to help answer some of your most asked questions. SINGAPORE: The coronavirus originating from China’s Wuhan city is spreading quickly in the country as well as across borders since it was first declared on the last day of 2019. Since then, the deadly pathogen has killed more than 200 people and infected nearly 10,000 in China alone. It has also reached more than 20 places across the world, with Hong Kong, Japan and Thailand among the highest counts of confirmed cases.  In Singapore, there have been 16 confirmed cases so far, all imported. CNA asked readers to submit questions on the coronavirus outbreak and had an overwhelming response. Questions ranged from how the virus is spread and whether it will affect pregnant women and their children.  To answer these, we enlisted the help of medical experts such as those from the Duke-NUS Medical School - Professor Gregory Gray, Assistant Professor Danielle Anderson and Professor Wang Linfa, who was also part of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) emergency committee looking into the virus outbreak - as well as Professor Benjamin Neuman, chair of Biological Sciences from Texas A&M University. Their lightly edited answers are as follows: Question: What is the difference between symptoms of Wuhan virus and flu/common cold? Prof Gray: They are very similar. Clinically, it is difficult to distinguish between the two; one really needs to use laboratory-based tests in order to do so. Prof Wang: Not much. Asst Prof Anderson: The symptoms of the flu and the Wuhan coronavirus are very similar and include fever, coughing and a runny nose.   Q: Can people recover naturally from the Wuhan coronavirus just like the common cold? Prof Gray: Yes. The vast majority will fully recover after their illness. Prof Wang: Yes, and the majority do. Asst Prof Anderson: Yes, people can recover naturally following infection and the majority of patients (98 per cent) do indeed recover. But while it is possible to recover from infection, some patients can develop severe disease and pneumonia. Q: How does the virus affect pregnant women and will it be transmitted to the unborn child? Prof Wang: It is not known yet. Prof Gray: Unknown, but pregnant women are often at increased risk of respiratory infections. Asst Prof Anderson: Currently there is not enough information available to determine if there is maternal transmission to the unborn child. A pregnant woman may develop more severe disease as they are immunocompromised and are more susceptible to complications of respiratory infections. Q: How should parents protect children under the age of 1 from the coronavirus? Prof Gray: Avoid having them come in contact with the public, especially people with respiratory signs and symptoms. Q: Can the virus be spread through water such as via swimming pools? Or through one’s eyes? Prof Gray: We don’t know, but other respiratory viruses can, such as adenovirus which is a hardier type of virus. Prof Wang: Transmission through the swimming pool is unlikely unless the person is swimming very close to an infected person. Yes, it is possible to be infected through the eyes. Asst Prof Anderson: It is unlikely that the coronavirus can be spread through water, especially chlorinated swimming pools. Coronaviruses are also not known to be spread though the eyes. There is an anecdotal case of infection through the eye and, if this infection did occur, it is an extremely rare event.   Q: How are those infected with the coronavirus being treated? What’s the success rate? Prof Wang: It is mostly just normal hospital care for severe cases. I have been told all confirmed cases (of the Wuhan coronavirus) are doing well in Singapore. There are drugs being tried in China, but it is too early to scientifically gauge their success rate. Asst Prof Anderson: If a patient has respiratory symptoms they may require breathing support. In milder cases, they can be given an intravenous drip to maintain blood pressure. Fluids can also be given in cases of diarrhoea, and ibuprofen or Panadol can be used for pain relief. Prof Gray: There is no specific treatment yet recognised as effective. Success rates are being determined now for supportive care. The mortality rate is low, less than 3 per cent, and likely will be lower as more people fully recover. (According to the WHO, global fatality rate for SARS patients was at 11 per cent) Q: Is the Wuhan coronavirus going to mutate further? Prof Gray: We don’t know, but the good news is that so far the 2019-nCoV virus is not changing. Prof Wang: All viruses mutate in nature. But so far, the Wuhan coronavirus seems to be quite stable. Q: Will tropical weather affect the spread of the virus? If yes, how? Prof Gray: Ultraviolet light can often kill respiratory viruses. Prof Wang: No scientific evidence for that yet. Q: How do you think this coronavirus outbreak will end? Prof Neuman: As a person who likes to make anti-viral drugs, things that actually slow down the virus, I can say that (better weather patterns or health measures) are probably not going to be the end (of the virus outbreak). And a vaccine will probably not going to be the end. It’s old-fashioned stuff like quarantines - basically keeping infected people away from healthy people that actually beat viruses like this. The risk is there are only so many quarantine facilities available in mainland China and only so many facilities to keep people properly treated while they are being treated for the virus. So if there are too many people that turn up sick, and overwhelm the systems that are there, that is potentially a risk.   We’ve seen China build new hospitals very quickly... so I believe they realise this possible risk and are trying to combat it - which is actually very good news. Q: Can you predict how long the virus will last? Prof Gray: I don’t expect to see a quick resolution. We are seeing the epidemic expand into other countries now. Prof Wang: No expert can do such a prediction as this is a highly complex matter. Even the experts at WHO are monitoring and assessing daily. However, the next two weeks will be critical when the Chinese New Year holiday ends in China. If we see a decrease in two to three weeks, I am hopeful we can control this. Asst Prof Anderson: It is difficult to predict when the peak of infection will occur. If the quarantine measures are effective and patients can be isolated for 14 days, the outbreak should end.

The civilian aircraft will leave Hubei's capital Wuhan on Sunday (Feb 9) bound for the Royal Air Force base at Brize Norton in southern England. Medics and Foreign Office officials will be on board to provide support if necessary. "We have been working round the clock to help British nationals leave Hubei province, on UK, French and New Zealand flights," said Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. "The Foreign Office is chartering a second and final UK flight with space to help all British nationals and their dependants remaining in Hubei to leave. "I encourage all British nationals in Hubei to register with our teams if they want to leave on this flight." Britain has advised all its nationals in China to leave. Some 83 British citizens returned from Wuhan on a UK government-chartered flight from Wuhan to Brize Norton on Friday. They were then sent into 14 days' isolation at a medical facility in northwest England. So far, there have been two confirmed cases in Britain, two relatives who had recently been to China. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC television that the pair remained in quarantine. "There are two cases only here in the UK but we do expect more, so we are taking no chances," he added. Hancock said people returning from China would not be quarantined and should instead "self-isolate" at home and call medics if they show symptoms rather than go to a hospital, for fear of spreading the virus. Eight British nationals and six of their family members left China on a flight to New Zealand on Tuesday. More than 24,000 people have been infected in China.

Speaking at a Chinese New Year Celebration in Teck Ghee, Mr Lee said that everyone is concerned about the coronavirus as some may recall when the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) hit Singapore in 2003. “We did not know how long it would last, and we worried about our loved ones being infected. But we stayed united and dealt with the crisis together." Since then, Mr Lee said that Singapore has become better prepared with medical facilities like the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and healthcare professionals who are trained to deal with this scenario. “So I have every confidence that we can overcome the challenge before us,” he said. Referring to Singapore’s decision to restrict entry to new visitors of any nationality with recent travel history to mainland China, Mr Lee said it was a pre-emptive measure taken purely to protect Singapore’s public health.  He added that China is doing all it can to contain the coronavirus spread, including imposing their own travel restrictions within China, cancelling outbound tour groups and bringing back Hubei residents from overseas. “It is a much stronger response than they took when SARS first broke out, so our efforts ... will complement China’s efforts," he said. "We wish China well in their efforts to fight the virus,” Mr Lee added. Regrettably, sentiment against those from the People’s Republic of China has emerged in the last few days in many countries, said Mr Lee, adding that such sentiments are “not helpful at all”.  “The virus may have started in China but it doesn’t respect nationality or race. It doesn't check your passport before it goes into your body and anybody can be infected." Mr Lee stressed that the coronavirus situation should be seen as a public health issue and not as a race or international diplomatic problem. Mr Lee noted that while the situation with the new coronavirus bears some similarities to SARS, it also is somewhat different. The new virus seems to be less lethal than SARS but is also more infectious. Patient may also be asymptomatic when they are infectious, which makes detection difficult. Hence, Mr Lee said that Singapore has to work harder to isolate suspect cases as soon as they are identified, and contain the virus from spreading in the community.  Another difference from SARS is that Singapore did not have social media back then. In a crisis, Mr Lee said social media has been both a boon and a bane as there is now a lot more information circulating online, on WhatsApp and on Facebook, including misleading rumours and false information. Mr Lee said some of these go viral because people are anxious and want to share information without verifying it. Such rumours can easily amplify anxieties and make it harder for people to get the correct information they need, and can even spark fear and panic, he added. “So I strongly advise everybody, if you hear something shocking ... check with proper channels, check from trusted places.” Members of the public can also subscribe to the Government WhatsApp channel to get the latest updates. Mr Lee said everyone can also play their part to be responsible for their own and their families’ safety by practising good personal hygiene and washing their hands frequently.  Those who have a fever, or show symptoms of a cold, should put on a mask and see the doctor. “We know that some of you are worried as you could not buy your own masks." For those who need them, Mr Lee said each household can collect a pack of four masks from their neighbourhood RCs, in stages starting from Saturday. Mr Lee ended his speech by calling on Singapore to remain resilient and calm, respond to the situation as one united nation, and “show care and concern for our fellow human beings”. He added that everyone should continue with their lives as much as possible and that he has confidence Singapore will get through this situation together as it is well-prepared and has dealt with worse situations before.

- Date: 01 Feb 2020 07:55PM 01 Feb 2020 11:44PM- Title: Avoid speculating, spreading 'unfounded rumours' on Wuhan coronavirus: NEA- cases: meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The National Environment Agency (NEA) on Saturday (Feb 1) advised members of the public to not speculate or spread "unfounded rumours" regarding the Wuhan coronavirus. Referring to a circulating text message that contains a list of "places to avoid" in Singapore, NEA said that there is no need for members of the public to avoid these locations. The text message that is currently being shared on messaging platforms such as WhatsApp and Telegram includes the names of hotels, hospitals and shopping centres that have been purportedly exposed to confirmed cases in Singapore. “We would like to assure the public that NEA officers have been liaising closely with, and providing support to, residents and owners of premises, to ensure that the cleaning and disinfection of areas are done in accordance with our guidelines. "We have also issued sanitation and hygiene advisories to premises and facilities with high public access like hotels and F&B outlets, including hawker centres," NEA said.  Singapore has reported 18 cases of the infection as of Saturday. Many of the confirmed cases are visitors to Singapore and have been to locations such as Orchard Road, Gardens by the Bay and Sentosa. Acting clinical director for the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Dr Shawn Vasoo told CNA that rumours claiming members of the public can get the coronavirus infection from walking through certain places is “categorically untrue”.  “You don't get infection typically from places, but from infected persons. So I would say that the messages that have been going out on WhatsApp and other social media … we should not be spreading them because it causes an unnecessary degree of paranoia and worry amongst people. “You only get infected by, typically, by an infected person and you have to be in quite close contact with the person,” he said. Dr Vasoo also said that “close contact” typically refers to people who are living in the same household, those who are caring for someone who might be infected, or those who are the same space for a prolonged period of time. Transient contact – for example, walking past someone in a public space – is not considered close contact and the likelihood for infection for that is probably minuscule, he added.

None of the 18 previously announced cases is critically ill. All of them remain in stable condition, and most are improving, the ministry said. As of noon on Sunday, 240 suspect cases have tested negative for 2019-nCoV, while test results for another 43 cases are pending. MOH also gave more details on an 18th confirmed case which was announced on Saturday. The 18th case, a 31 year-old Chinese woman who arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 22, reported that she was asymptomatic during her flight to Singapore. She was a travelling companion of the 12th confirmed case and was identified as a close contact on Jan 30. She reported that she had not left her room at Home Suite View Hotel in Geylang until she was transferred to a government quarantine facility in the early hours of Jan 31. While at the facility, she reported that she has had a cough since the day before. She was taken by an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), where she was immediately isolated. Tests confirmed her 2019-nCoV infection on Saturday afternoon. She is currently warded at NCID. MOH has identified 251 close contacts of the 18 cases. Of the 182 who are still in Singapore, 179 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining three close contacts, the ministry said. Singapore on Friday announced that it will widen travel restrictions to include all new visitors with recent travel history to China. The expanded measures started at 11.59pm on Saturday. As of 1pm on Sunday, the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) has refused entry to 15 travellers into Singapore, due to either their travel histories to mainland China in the last 14 days, or suspension of visa facilities. They are of six nationalities - one Spanish, one British, one Malaysian, two US, five PRC and five Indian passport holders, ICA said. On Saturday, authorities began distributing packs of four surgical masks for each Singapore household. There have been long queues for masks at pharmacies and retailers across the country.  Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing on Sunday also said that the impact of the Wuhan coronavirus situation could be "wider, deeper and longer" than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. The Singapore Tourism Board has announced measures to help the tourism sector, including waiving licence fees for hotels, travel agents and tour guides.

The country was ill-prepared for the outbreak at the time, she said, noting there were not enough isolation rooms and efforts then were based out of the old Communicable Disease Centre compound on Moulmein Road – which has since been replaced by the NCID. The new facility is better placed to handle the Wuhan coronavirus situation, she noted. The NCID, which officially opened in September last year, has more than 330 isolation rooms at its Jalan Tan Tock Seng location. Between November 2002 and July 2003, SARS affected 8,098 people worldwide, resulting in 774 deaths across 17 countries. In Singapore, 238 were infected, resulting in the deaths of 33 people here. For her work in tackling the SARS crisis, Dr Ang received the National Day Award (Medal of Valour) and the Courage Medal. Dr Ang - who also chairs Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s infection control committee – also played a role in controlling the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. Eighteen people died in that outbreak here. THE CURRENT SITUATION The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak a "global emergency". As of Saturday morning, there were more than 11,000 confirmed cases of Wuhan coronavirus worldwide, with 258 reported deaths, all in China. Singapore now has 16 confirmed cases of the virus, including a 47-year-old Singaporean who travelled to Wuhan with her family. In dealing with the virus, Singapore has learned many lessons from dealing with SARS 17 years ago, she said. “Each outbreak is different, but the core principles remain the same.” These include “very strict compliance with infection control measures”, as well as ensuring accurate information gets disseminated to stem rumours and misinformation.  “Part of the reaction to any outbreak response is managing fears on the ground, as well as coming up with relevant recommendations,” she noted. For example, while frontline staff at NCID such as doctors and nurses - as well as others such as security staff who may also have to deal with patients - may need to wear masks, this is not necessary for everyone. “If you’re in finance, you don’t need to wear a mask,” she said. While morale is generally high, she acknowledges that there are concerns among staff who are dealing with the current coronavirus situation. “There are fears, especially for those who didn't go through SARS,” said Dr Ang. “We have a few SARS veterans here. One of the things I said at the first briefings (for the Wuhan coronavirus) was don’t worry, we have been through this before. We can handle it.” “I saw Singapore's first SARS case, I’m still alive and standing,” she said. The work of handling patients cannot be just be left to junior staff, she said, adding senior staff including consultants must also be seen to be doing their part. Senior anesthetists were among the first to volunteer to be on call during the SARS crisis in 2003, she noted. “Seniors cannot just be hiding in their offices, they have to be there.” On how widespread the Wuhan coronavirus is likely to be, Dr Ang said current literature suggests that even people who are exposed to the virus do not necessarily get infected. “It probably isn’t that infectious, (even though) people are wearing surgical masks all over the place.”  Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

- Date: 21 Jan 2020 10:51PM 22 Jan 2020 06:15PM- Title: Wuhan virus: Infectious diseases centre Singapore's first line of defence- cases: meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) is poised to be the first line of defence against the Wuhan virus, should it land in Singapore. The centre, which opened in September last year, has begun conducting pre-screening for patients and designated a special precaution area for suspected cases. On Tuesday (Jan 21), the Ministry of Health broadened the criteria for suspected cases, a day after announcing temperature screening for all travellers arriving at Changi Airport from China.   Travellers with pneumonia who were in China within the two weeks before symptoms started showing will be isolated. Those with acute respiratory infection who have been to any hospital in China in the 14 days before symptoms surfaced will also be isolated. NCID has more than 330 isolation rooms within its Jalan Tan Tock Seng facility, where suspected cases may be housed until they are determined to no longer be infectious. There is no specific medication or treatment for the novel coronavirus, but patients can expect to receive all necessary supportive treatment such as oxygen therapy to support the lungs. NCID executive director Professor Leo Yee Sin said the centre is working closely with MOH to monitor and prepare for the situation.   “Singapore is very well-connected regionally as well as globally. We need to be ready, because we cannot confidently rule out the possibility of receiving a case of this novel coronavirus. "So the healthcare system is now being put on alert… We have such capacity in terms of the availability of the isolation beds, as well as trained individuals to be able to step up to the role, to be able to support the ministry in outbreak readiness ... We will do our best," said Prof Leo. China has confirmed the virus can spread between humans and Prof Leo noted there have been other interesting observations. “We have received reports indicating that there are more male than female (individuals) coming down with this novel coronavirus, and those older individuals as well as those with comorbidities tend to have more severe disease," she said. The NCID is also key in determining and confirming if a patient has the virus, which it does by looking for distinct sequencing patterns in a laboratory. The seven suspected cases in Singapore had their respiratory secretion samples sent there and all were tested negative for the Wuhan virus.   The testing is done in-house at the National Public Health Laboratory under strict protocol to ensure staff are well-protected. Any staff testing for the virus will need to wear the full personal protective equipment (PPE), which include double-layer gloves, and breathe through a Powered Air-Purifying Respirator. "The novel coronavirus shares certain things that are common to other coronaviruses like the SARS coronavirus, the MERS coronavirus from the Middle East and actually even from our normal common colds. We must find that part of virus that is unique to the new coronavirus and then we design our test to target only that," said laboratory director Associate Professor Raymond Lin. Assoc Prof Lin said this testing technique is common around the world, but because it is a new virus, various institutions may design the test slightly differently. “Which is the best design, we can only tell with time … or whether there’s a need to improve or refine the test,” he said. Community doctors including general practitioners (GPs) and polyclinic doctors are also on alert, especially since patients usually seek help from them first. Dr Chung Wing Hong, a GP at Finest Health Medical Centre in Toa Payoh, said the standard protocol would be to check the patients' travel history. Symptoms such as high fever and breathlessness are also tell-tale signs of suspected cases.   "If the patient is stable enough, then a dedicated ambulance service will be called upon to divert these patients to the relevant hospitals. If the patient is unstable, means (they are) in very severe respiratory distress, then the SCDF 995 will be activated," he said. Patients above 16 years old will be taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s emergency department, while children below 16 years will be taken to the emergency department at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. If necessary, they will then be transferred to NCID. Dr Chung said most clinics will stock up on PPE for staff, including items like N95 masks, surgical gowns and gloves. These will likely be deployed when a confirmed case is reported. As for the general public, Prof Leo said defence against the virus really comes down to maintaining good personal hygiene. "For those individuals who need to travel overseas, it is important that they first do adequate homework to find out the situational changes in locations they are going to go to and avoid crowded areas as well as at-risk areas such as markets," she said.
