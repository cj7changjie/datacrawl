10 Feb 2020 04:14PM,UK declares coronavirus a serious and imminent threat to public health,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners LONDON: Britain on Monday (Feb 10) said the number of confirmed coronavirus cases had doubled to eight as the government declared the virus a serious and imminent threat, giving it additional powers to isolate those suspected of being infected. Alarm over the coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December is driven by its rapid spread and the fact that infectious disease experts cannot yet know how deadly or contagious it is. It has killed more than 900 people, most of them in China, and has spread to at least 27 countries and territories. The two deaths outside mainland China were in Hong Kong and the Philippines. The new cases in England were all known contacts of a previously confirmed British patient in France, and were identified by public health officials working to trace possible cases. Health minister Matt Hancock declared the virus ""a serious and imminent threat to public health"" to give doctors more powers to isolate people. ""We are taking a belt and braces approach to all necessary precautions to ensure public safety,"" he said. ""Clinical advice has not changed about the risk to the public, which remains moderate."" Arrowe Park Hospital, near Liverpool, in northern England, and Kents Hill Park, in Milton Keynes, some 50 miles north of London, have been designated as isolation facilities. British nationals who have been flown back from Wuhan are being quarantined for 14 days while travellers returning home from other Asian countries have been told to self-isolate if they showed any of the coronavirus symptoms. The new cases in Britain are linked to a Briton who had returned from Singapore and stayed at a French ski resort between Jan 24 and Jan 28. An official from Singapore's Ministry of Health had said that the man had attended a private business meeting at Grand Hyatt Singapore. On Sunday, French health officials said five British nationals including a child had been diagnosed with the new coronavirus at the mountain village. Airline easyJet said Public Health England had contacted all passengers who were on board a flight from Geneva to London on Jan 28 after one of those on board was later diagnosed with coronavirus. ""Although the risk to others on board the flight is very low, crew who operated the flight have been advised to monitor their health for a 14 day period since the flight in line with Public Health England advice,"" the airline said. ""The original flight was 13 days ago and none are displaying any symptoms.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the novel coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

31 Jan 2020 03:45PM ,Malaysia to send 18 million medical gloves to Wuhan for healthcare workers amid coronavirus outbreak,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian government will be sending 18 million pieces of medical gloves to healthcare workers in Wuhan amid an escalating coronavirus outbreak. In a statement on Friday (Jan 31), Primary Industries Minister Teresa Kok said Malaysia is in full solidarity with the people of Wuhan. “At present, hospitals in Wuhan, the Central Chinese city, at the crux of the coronavirus outbreak, are calling out for much needed protective medical supplies such as masks, suits and gloves, as supplies run low. “The medical gloves, both natural rubber and nitrile, will be sent to China in batches with the first shipment being already on its way to Wuhan,” she said. Ms Kok said that her ministry had obtained the cooperation of the Malaysian Rubber Export Promotion Council (MREPC) and rubber gloves manufacturers in Malaysia on the initiative. It was during the Chinese New Year period but the companies stepped forward and gave their commitment in ensuring this initiative would be a success, she said. ""Malaysian glove industry players are prepared to be at the forefront of supplying high-quality medical gloves to the world, especially in critical times such as this to battle against the outbreak and the current pandemic,"" she said. Two companies, Top Glove and Supermax have already donated 2.3 million pieces of gloves through their local offices and distributors to Wuhan, she said.   Malaysia is the world's leading producer of medical gloves, with approximately 180 billion pieces exported worldwide annually. In 2014, Malaysia sent more than 20 million medical rubber gloves to five African nations (Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Nigeria and Congo) which were battling the deadly Ebola virus. China has been Malaysia's largest trading partner for 10 consecutive years, with trade growing 8.1 per cent to RM313.8 billion (US$76.7 billion) in 2018. On Friday, the World Health Organisation declared the 2019-nCov outbreak a global health emergency. As a measure to contain the virus, the Chinese government earlier announced a lockdown of 16 different cities, including Wuhan. The virus has claimed over 200 lives in China. Nearly 10,000 cases have been confirmed worldwide. Malaysia currently has eight confirmed cases, all of which involve Chinese nationals. Malaysia has said it will initiate a negotiation as soon as possible with the Chinese government to bring home 82 citizens in Wuhan.   On Wednesday, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said: “Right now, they (Malaysian citizens) are not allowed to leave Wuhan, but we want to negotiate with the Chinese government so that the Malaysian citizens who are not sick can (be allowed to) return to Malaysia"". He said if China allows them to return, they will be subject to 14 days of quarantine to make sure that they are not suffering from infection. Additionally, Dr Mahathir said Putrajaya will bring in supplies to help the Chinese government when sending charter flights to bring Malaysians home. “We are interested to help Wuhan, so if we have to send a charter flight to evacuate our citizens from Wuhan, if allowed by the Chinese government, we will also bring food, gloves and face masks because they are facing supply shortage over there,” he said.

05 Feb 2020 04:13PM,Vietnam setting up field hospitals for possible coronavirus influx,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners HANOI: Vietnam is setting up field hospitals with thousands of beds to handle a potential influx of coronavirus cases, health officials said, as it prepares to receive its nationals from China. Vietnam shares a long porous border with China and the communist neighbours have close trade and tourism ties. So far Vietnam has 10 confirmed cases of coronavirus - including three people with no recent travel history to China. The virus, declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization, has so far killed nearly 500 people and infected more than 24,000, mostly in mainland China. Travel restrictions, flight bans and quarantines have been imposed as countries ramp up efforts to control the fast-spreading pathogen. In Vietnam's southern business hub of Ho Chi Minh city - where three cases of coronavirus have been confirmed - two existing facilities are being converted into field hospitals with a total capacity of 500 beds. They will ""receive, monitor and treat"" all suspected patients of coronavirus if the epidemic spreads further, according to the director of the city's health department, Nguyen Tan Binh. In Hanoi, two military facilities have been turned into quarantine centres for up to 1,500 people as the country prepares to receive 950 people from China to be isolated at the sites. Two provinces in northern Vietnam near the China border have also set up beds for close to 3,000 patients. Central Vietnam has centres ready for as many as 3,700. Vietnam has not announced plans to repatriate its citizens from China en masse, though 21 Vietnamese students in Wuhan - the centre of the epidemic - could be brought back on a chartered flight, the government said. Vietnam has banned all flights to and from mainland China and suspended new tourist visas for Chinese nationals or foreigners who have been there in the past two weeks. All passenger trains to and from China have also been halted.

07 Feb 2020 10:29AM,Third confirmed coronavirus case in Britain attended meeting in Singapore,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners LONDON: A British man who tested positive for the novel coronavirus had travelled to Singapore, the BBC and the Guardian reported on Thursday (Feb 6). He is the third confirmed case in Britain, and the first British national to have caught the virus, the Guardian quoted government sources as saying. On Friday, director of medical services at Singapore's Ministry of Health (MOH) said that the man had attended a private business meeting at Grand Hyatt Singapore. ""My understanding is (that) very recently, the United Kingdom also announced one case related to the same meeting,” he said. Four other attendees of the meeting, which was held between Jan 20 and 22, have been infected with the virus, Mr Mak said. One of them is Singaporean, two are South Koreans and one is Malaysian. While MOH said that all 109 attendees of the meeting are from the same company, Mr Mak said he was not at liberty to reveal the name of the company as the matter is still under investigation. It has been reported, however, that the event was organised by Servomex, which describes itself as a ""provider of reliable, accurate and stable gas measurements"". A source has also told CNA that the event was organised by the company, which was founded in the UK and has worldwide offices. CNA contacted Servomex's office in Singapore for comment, but the company did not respond. The British patient, a middle-aged man, is the first case in Britain to have contracted the virus outside China, the BBC reported. He was isolated at home prior to being confirmed positive for the virus and is being treated at a specialist infectious diseases unit at a London hospital, it added. “The individual did not acquire (the coronavirus) in the UK,” said the country’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty on Thursday. “We are now working quickly to identify any contacts the patient has had.” On Thursday, the Chinese ambassador to the UK said the country’s advice for its nationals to leave China was an “overreaction”. Liu Xiaoming called for a more measured approach after Britain advised its nationals to leave China “if they can” to minimise risk of exposure to the virus. Travellers arriving in Britain from nine countries and territories have been advised to stay at home and call the National Health Service (NHS) if they are ill within 14 days of their arrival. The advisory, which initially only covered mainland China, has been modified to include Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Macau. Britain’s Department of Health urged the public to call the NHS even if they are presenting mild symptoms. “These countries have been identified because of the volume of air travel from affected areas, understanding of other travel routes and number of reported cases,” it was quoted by the BBC as saying. “This list will be kept under review.” Two other people from the same family had previously tested positive for the virus in the UK. British officials had warned that the country is highly likely to have cases of the novel coronavirus, which has killed 636 people and infected more than 31,000. Only two deaths have been reported outside China, with one each in the Philippines and Hong Kong. The epidemic, which was declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization, is believed to have originated from a market that sold wildlife in Wuhan, Hubei province.

13 Feb 2020 10:03AM,China transparent in coronavirus response: UN envoy,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: China has handled the new coronavirus outbreak in a transparent and ""highly responsible"" way, the country's UN ambassador said Wednesday (Feb 13), after criticism that local authorities did not react quickly enough. Since its emergence in the central province of Hubei in December, the COVID-19 virus has killed more than 1,350 people and infected tens of thousands. There have been more than 500 infections in almost 30 countries and territories outside mainland China, including two deaths. ""Facing the epidemic, we have always adopted an open, transparent and highly responsible attitude,"" Beijing's United Nations ambassador Zhang Jun told the UN Commission for Social Development. ""We have reported the epidemic information to the WHO, the relevant countries, and Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan regions as soon as it is available, shared the genetic sequences of the virus, actively communicated with other countries in order to come up with responses,"" he said. Most of the cases have been in Hubei, where about 56 million people have been placed under virtual quarantine. Authorities have restricted the movements of people in several other cities far from the epicentre in an unprecedented containment effort. ""Not only for the sake of China, but also the world, we have adopted rigorous prevention and control measures ... effectively curbing the spread of the epidemic,"" Zhang said. China drew international condemnation for covering up cases during the 2002-03 SARS outbreak, whereas the World Health Organization has praised measures taken by Beijing to combat COVID-19.   But anger erupted in China this month after the death of a doctor in Wuhan, the Hubei provincial capital and virus epicentre, whom police silenced when he flagged the emerging virus in December. Local authorities in Hubei and Wuhan had already faced rare, uncensored criticism online for initially downplaying the magnitude of the outbreak. Critics say precious time was lost by the early inaction of the local government. Hubei and Wuhan officials held important political meetings in the first weeks of January. The death toll and number of cases only began to soar afterwards, going from one fatality on Jan 11 to more than 630 barely four weeks later. ""Addressing global public health issues is a common challenge faced by all countries,"" Zhang said, calling for international cooperation.

31 Jan 2020 10:08PM,"Wuhan coronavirus, Singapore's emergency preparedness to be discussed in Parliament","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The Wuhan coronavirus and Singapore's medical emergency preparedness are among the issues to be discussed when Parliament sits on Monday (Feb 3). Two Bills will be introduced during the sitting for the first time, The Hindu Endowments (Amendment) Bill and the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) (Amendment) Bill. Six will be tabled for a second reading, including the Singapore Convention on Mediation Bill and the Active Mobility (Amendment) Bill, which seeks to extend the e-scooter ban on footpaths to all motorised personal mobility devices (PMDs). MPs have submitted more than 50 questions on a range of issues, with several MPs such as Desmond Choo, Rahayu Mahzam and Liang Eng Hwa asking about the Government’s measures to deal with the Wuhan coronavirus should the outbreak worsen in Singapore. The virus, which originated in China’s central Hubei province, has killed more than 200 people and infected nearly 10,000, mostly in China. The Ministry of Health on Friday announced confirmed 16 cases in Singapore, including one Singaporean, as authorities widened travel restrictions to combat the spread of the coronavirus. SINGAPORE'S EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS Singapore’s medical preparedness is also in the spotlight after the Lucky Plaza car accident, where the victims were taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital instead of the nearby Mount Elizabeth Hospital, which was not equipped to handle severe trauma patients. MP Joan Pereira is asking if the Government will consider requiring all private and public hospitals to be equipped and manned to handle severe and multiple trauma cases in their accident and emergency departments as part of Singapore’s emergency preparedness plan. Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) Daniel Goh will ask whether the emergency departments of private hospitals should be upgraded for a tiered national accident and emergency system. As Australia declares a state of emergency over the bushfires threatening large parts of the country, climate and other environmental issues are some of the issues that will be discussed. MP Seah Kian Peng will ask if the Australian bushfires have threatened Singapore's environment and food security. NCMP Dennis Tan will ask if the Government has any plans on reducing greenhouse emissions from Singapore's oil refining industry, while MP Louis Ng will ask if the Government could publish its collection of the 2019 carbon tax payments. On other issues, NCMP Leon Perera will ask about the reasons for the discoloured tap water in the Basic Military Training Camp (BMTC) on Pulau Tekong last year and what measures are being taken to reduce the risk of such an incident in future. He will also ask what the Government is doing to address attitudes of students and educators towards the sexual objectification and harassment of women, in light of concerns over voyeurism cases at institutes of higher learning. MP Cheng Li Hui will suggest that the Government conduct a review of the funeral industry in Singapore, after a mix-up resulted in the wrong body being cremated. MP Christopher de Souza will also ask about the rise in piracy and robbery cases in the Singapore Strait and its surrounding waters. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

12 Feb 2020 08:14AM ,"Japan cruise ship coronavirus cases climb to 175, including quarantine officer","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TOKYO: Another 39 people have tested positive for the coronavirus on the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan as well as one quarantine officer, bringing the total to 175, the health ministry said on Wednesday (Feb 12). The Diamond Princess was placed in quarantine for two weeks upon arriving in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, on Feb 3, after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus. The epidemic originated in mainland China, where more than 1,100 people have now died of the virus. About 3,700 people are on board the ship, which usually has a crew of 1,100 and a passenger capacity of 2,670. Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said in parliament that he wanted to expand testing to all passengers and crew on board, and that authorities could muster resources to do more than 1,000 tests a day, according to national broadcaster NHK.  The ministry said tests were being conducted for others deemed to need them and it would announce the results later. The British-flagged Diamond Princess is managed by Princess Cruise Lines, one of the world's largest cruise lines and a unit of Carnival Corp. Kyodo news agency, citing the health ministry, said that of the 39 cases, 10 were crew and 29 were passengers. Ten were Japanese nationals and the others were from 11 countries, including the United States and China. Four were in serious condition, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said. People who test positive for the virus are taken off the ship to a hospital.   The quarantine officer who was infected had been handing out questionnaires checking the health of passengers and crew since Feb 3, and had been following rules that require the wearing of a mask and gloves but not a full protective suit, according to the Nikkei business daily, quoting the health ministry. ""It's terrible about the quarantine officer,"" one passenger on the ship, who declined to be identified, told Reuters. ""The ones who came to our room to do the initial screening had gloves and surgical masks, while the ones who came to do the actual virus test also had full gowns and full-face masks."" 'HIGH RISK' A health ministry official had no immediate comment, but Nikkei said the ministry was checking the officer's contacts with colleagues and family members. Mark Kortepeter, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, said that although it was hard to reach conclusions based on limited information, the ship infections pointed to an ""agent that is highly transmissible,"" at least in enclosed environments.   ""The infected quarantine officer probably indicates the high risk, even for individuals who are trying to protect themselves, because the virus is unforgiving and there is no room for error in use of personal protective equipment and hand hygiene,"" he said. ""A small number of virus particles is likely needed to infect, making it an efficient spreader."" The government was considering allowing elderly and those with chronic illnesses to disembark before the Feb 19 target date for the end of quarantine, some media reported, but added it would take time to determine where they could be sent. About 80 per cent of the passengers were aged 60 or over, with 215 in their 80s and 11 in the 90s, the English-language Japan Times newspaper reported. An improvement in life for people on the boat came several days ago with the announcement they can receive packages sent to the address of the pier - a service that Rob Thomson, a New Zealander living in northern Japan, whose parents are on the boat, made prompt use of. ""The one thing that they were missing were hot drinks during the day - they were getting coffee or tea at breakfast, but then during the day it was cold water or Coca-Cola or soft drinks ... and Dad was saying he'd like fresh fruit other than apples or oranges,"" he said, adding that he placed an order Tuesday night. ""So I tried sending some grapes and strawberries and stuff. And apparently the fresh things have already been delivered to somebody on the dock."" The foreign ministry released a notice on Wednesday urging its nationals to consider delaying trips to China and for Japanese in China to return home. Japan has sent four chartered flights to China's Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, for its citizens there to return, and plans a fifth. The people who returned on the first flight will be released on Wednesday if they test negative for the virus, media said.

25 Jan 2020 07:42PM,China to build second new hospital to treat cases of coronavirus in Wuhan,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: A central Chinese city that is the epicentre of a new SARS-like virus outbreak is building a second hospital ""within half a month"" to treat cases, state media reported Saturday (Jan 25). According to the People's Daily, the new hospital will add 1,300 hospital beds, in addition to another new facility which is being built in Wuhan to deal with the outbreak - reportedly within 10 days. The first new hospital will be built around a holiday complex originally intended for local workers, set in gardens by a lake on the outskirts of the city, Changjiang Daily reported on Friday. Prefabricated buildings with 1,000 beds will be put up. Building machinery, including 35 diggers and 10 bulldozers, arrived at the site on Thursday night, with the aim of getting the new facility ready by Monday, the paper added. ""The construction of this project is to solve the shortage of existing medical resources,"" the report said. ""Because it will be prefabricated buildings, it will not only be built fast but it also won't cost much."" The hospital aims to copy the experience of Beijing in 2003, when the city battled Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). As many as 774 people died in the SARS epidemic, which reached nearly 30 countries. At the time, Beijing built the Xiaotangshan hospital in its northern suburbs in just a week. Within two months, it treated one-seventh of all the country's SARS patients, the Changjiang Daily said. ""It created a miracle in the history of medical science,"" the paper added. The Beijing hospital, built by 7,000 workers, was originally designed only to take people who were in recovery from SARS to relieve pressure on other hospitals. In the end it treated nearly 700 SARS patients. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Copyright© Mediacorp 2020. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

03 Feb 2020 01:46PM ,"Fearing novel coronavirus, Hong Kong residents stock up on food, essentials","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners HONG KONG: Panic-stricken residents have emptied shelves in major supermarkets in Hong Kong, stockpiling meat, rice, cleaning products and soap as fears escalate over a coronavirus epidemic on the mainland. The rush to procure food in the city of 7.4 million people is unprecedented, residents say, describing it as far worse than the panic during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that killed nearly 800 people around the world, including nearly 300 in Hong Kong. The new coronavirus originated in central China's Hubei province and has so far killed 361 people in the country. Over the weekend in Hong Kong, hundreds of people queued for hours to buy masks and immune-boosting products such as vitamin C.   At a major supermarket in the bustling Wan Chai district, counters selling chilled meat and seafood were empty by mid-morning on Friday and over the weekend, with stocks of fresh vegetables dwindling. ""Everybody is really worried. I think everyone is afraid of what is going to happen in the next few days. Prices are also going to rise,"" said Cindy, a retail executive who was buying dry food and soap. Dozens of mask-wearing shoppers pushed trolleys down empty aisles showing sold-out signs for hand wash and antiseptic liquids. Others tried to stock up on remaining bags of rice and packaged noodles. The rush to buy food and cleaning products comes as some shoppers said they were concerned that a potential shutdown of the border would impact the supply of products.     Around 90 per cent of the city's total food supply is imported, with the bulk coming from the mainland, according to official data. The Hong Kong government has closed some border crossings, including the high-speed rail, but has stopped short of a complete shutdown, despite growing calls from medical workers, who plan a strike on Monday to demand action. The government is grappling with how to handle spreading infections locally, with 15 confirmed cases in the city. Calls have grown for the government to close the border with mainland China to minimise the risk of infection. Hong Kong's economy was badly hit during the SARS epidemic with tourism and services sectors the most affected as visitor arrivals tumbled and unemployment spiralled.

08 Feb 2020 06:00AM,"Commentary: Amid gloomy outlook, Hong Kong wrestles with novel coronavirus. But it’s surprisingly resilient","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners The Hong Kong economy has weathered two recent economic crisis over recent decades. But the novel coronavirus and continuing protests pose a different challenge, says Mohammed Abdul Shihab. DUBAI: As protests in Hong Kong continue into the New Year, the city is grappling with a new challenge: A slowing Asian economy made worse by the novel coronavirus outbreak. The coronavirus shows no signs of slowing, having infected more than 30,000 people and claiming hundreds of lives in mainland China. Hong Kong has reported more than 20 cases and at least one death. At least four of the reported cases were transmitted locally, leading some to say that the city is on the brink of a community outbreak comparable to SARS. Meanwhile, the World Bank says the continent will have to contend with weakening global demand – a challenge exacerbated by the largely unresolved trade war between Washington and Beijing despite a Phase 1 deal. Growth in East Asia is projected to ease to 5.7 per cent in 2020, reflecting also a moderate slowdown in China and external headwinds. But these projections may be downgraded again in light of the worsening effects of the novel coronavirus on the Chinese, and thus the Asian, economy. Markets were stable early last week on the back of estimates that this new virus would have little economic impact given the 2003 SARS outbreak did little damage. Last Thursday, however, global markets dove after news of an uptick in new infections, and, that the lockdown imposed in China has effectively shut down vast swathes of its working population. The selloff continued in China on Monday as stocks there dropped 8 per cent. THE LIGHTHOUSE IN STORMY WATERS During past slowdowns, Hong Kong was seen as the lighthouse in stormy waters – an economic powerhouse and political haven that could withstand both regional and global pressures. Carefully cultivated fiscal policies have made the city an indispensable base for multinational banks and corporations. Hong Kong has also maintained the top spot on the 2019 Index of Economic Freedom, which noted that the territory is “an exceptionally competitive financial and business hub that remains one of the world’s most resilient economies"".   Heading into the new decade, however, the reality is more nuanced. Continuing protests have shaken confidence in the city’s financial hub, stymied tourism, and hurt its retail sector. Compounded with reverberations from the trade war, Hong Kong’s economy contracted 2.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2019, marking the third consecutive contraction in the city state’s first recession in a decade. This downturn is conservatively forecast to end in the latter half of 2020, with the International Monetary Fund predicting overall GDP growth of about 1.5 per cent for the year. Interestingly, these predictions already take into account disruptions arising from the months-long protests, meaning an easing of these disturbances could ease economic stress in 2020. That, in addition to the tough lessons learned from financial crises in the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 2008 global crisis, could make Hong Kong one of the region’s best economic performers this year. HONG KONG HAS SURVIVED PAST CRISES In 1997, Asia was hit by an economic crisis when currencies across the east of the continent – starting with Thailand – began to fall precipitously, triggering bailouts in some cases by the International Monetary Fund. As a sell-off intensified, Hong Kong took advantage of its vast foreign exchange reserves to swiftly protect the peg that linked its currency’s value to that of the US dollar. At the time, economists described this peg as “the indicator of political confidence,” and predicted a loss would have fuel capital flight, tumbling property prices and collapsing banks. Having the foresight to build such large foreign reserves and the insight to harness them led to a strong defence of the currency against a speculative attack.   Hong Kong officials also reacted swiftly to shore up targeted companies after speculators turned their eye to the stock market. In all, Hong’s Kong’s stock market remained the best performing market in the region during the crisis, despite the Hang Seng falling by 60 per cent that year and property prices slumping. Although the contributing factors to the 2008 global recession were different, catalysed by the US subprime mortgage crisis, lessons learned from the downturn 10 years earlier helped the territory stay on its feet and turned the economy around in the same year. Donald Tong, Hong Kong Commissioner for Economic and Trade Affairs, said the city defied the downturn because of improvements in risk management, a more transparent regulatory environment, a continued focus on financial innovation, and sound fundamentals including “prudent fiscal policies and healthy fiscal reserves”. Measures were enacted to boost public confidence, including a government guarantee on all bank deposits without a ceiling, a prioritising of public infrastructure projects, and a multibillion-dollar plan to unfreeze credit for businesses. Singing praises for the Hong Kong Treasury’s actions, Janet Yellen, who went on to chair the US Federal Reserve, noted Hong Kong was recovering “impressively” from the global recession - more so than the United States. A NEW ERA? The city’s resilience, underpinned by an elastic and dynamic monetary policy, should instill a sense of confidence that it is well-positioned to handle global economic uncertainties in 2020. Yet this time around, Hong Kong will fight a slightly different battle: A battle against the novel coronavirus outbreak. Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced the closure of all but two land border crossings to China, as well as a mandatory two-week quarantine for all travellers arriving from mainland China this week.   But criticism has grown over the government’s perceived slow response to the outbreak, amid calls for Hong Kong to fully close the border with the mainland. Hundreds of medical workers went on strike starting from Feb 3, demanding the government seal off the border to stop the spread of the virus and ease pressure on strained health facilities. An escalation of the outbreak, not just in Hong Kong but also in China, would add significant stress already imposed by the city’s divisive protest groups. The protests alone were responsible for visitor numbers falling by almost 40 per cent in the second half of 2019, fuelled by uncertainty in public safety. Trips from mainland China have taken a nosedive, and in October, were down more than 45 per cent compared with the same period last year. The unrest has also hurt retail. Last November, sales were lower than the year before, with small businesses feeling under strain, unemployment rising, and footfall declining because of how many recent demonstrations had taken place in shopping districts. On the other hand, Alibaba’s blockbuster secondary listing in Hong Kong in November last year, the biggest IPO in 2019, eased fears of a recession and was seen by many as a vote of confidence in the city. THE WORLD’S FREEST ECONOMY During the crisis of 1998, Joseph Yam, the then Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority affirmed: We are committed to maintaining our position as the world's freest economy. Hong Kong has built its reputation on free market principles. Indeed, for Hong Kong to stay true to form as financially resilient, protest groups and the government will need to begin tough negotiations on how to revive the city’s civility.   Already, outbreak fears risk becoming a new flashpoint in the city’s unrest. The Hong Kong government had to halt work on turning a housing estate as a possible quarantine facility after violent protests erupted on Monday (Jan 27) as protesters hurled a molotov cocktail at the site. No doubt, any new negotiations will focus on a cohesive political agreement, and one that reaffirms the “one-country, two-systems” principle that has allowed Hong Kong to embrace the West and China so successfully. But now that challenge is compounded by a deadly virus outbreak – a threat Lam’s administration must respond to decisively to avoid opening up another front for violent protests. The city’s political and economic future depend on it. Mohammed Abdul Shihab is Managing Director of Al-Sharq Advisory. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

06 Feb 2020 06:30AM,'The kampung spirit is still alive': Punggol residents step up amid coronavirus outbreak,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: In several HDB blocks in Punggol West, you can almost smell the kampung spirit in the air - through the faint scent of hand sanitisers and alcohol wipes in the lifts. Amid fears that the novel coronavirus might spread widely in Singapore, some residents have taken steps to help prevent that. The virus which originated in China has since killed more than 560 people and infected more than 20,000 globally. Singapore announced this week that seven Singapore residents with no recent travel history to China had tested positive for the virus, including a six-month-old baby. This takes Singapore's total number of confirmed cases to 28. Face masks and hand sanitisers have disappeared from store shelves, prompting the Government to release masks directly from the stockpile to households.    FREE SANTISERS AND WIPES When CNA visited Punggol West on Wednesday (Feb 5), bottles of hand sanitisers and baskets of alcohol wipes were strapped to the railings in several lifts across multiple HDB blocks. Handwritten notes encouraged residents to use or take the items. ""Use what you need,"" read one note. ""Please take one ... From your neighbour, with love,"" read another. Residents told CNA that face masks were also available previously in the lifts. ""It's great, everyone provides these things to bring down the fear of the virus, it's a community effort,"" said Lawrence, a resident of Block 261B, Punggol Way. The 40-year-old engineer said he believes there are at least two residents placing the sanitisers and wipes in the lifts, as the items appeared at different times. ""Even if you don't need or use the items, you feel a sense of security, and it makes you really feel the kampung spirit - if you have extra, why not share it? ""Who knows, when the sanitiser runs out, I might contribute too - if I can find any,"" said Lawrence. ""It's a pretty nice gesture, especially since it might be hard to get hand sanitisers now,"" said resident Leung Hoi Ki. ""Someone is willing to give one bottle away just so that everybody can use it. I feel that it is quite nice of them,"" Ms Leung added. Speaking to CNA, Member of Parliament for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC Sun Xueling said that the actions of those residents reflect ""the goodness in humanity"". ""When things are organic and people really feel it and want to do it, that's when outcomes are best. It comes from the heart and doesn't have to be forced,"" said Ms Sun. ""It's not just the lifts, quite a few residents in Punggol West have been very kind to bring down or deliver food items (for volunteers giving out masks),"" she added. ""In difficult times, the best and the worst in people come through,"" said Ms Sun. ""And here, the goodness in humanity shines through - people caring about each other, sharing scarce resources, encouraging each other to be responsible towards community health."" COUPLE SEARCHED VIETNAM PHARMACIES FOR MASKS, DISTRIBUTED S$1,000 WORTH When he heard about the shortage of masks in Singapore, Punggol resident Adrian Tan knew he had to do something. The 39-year-old and his 34-year-old wife Vy Chen were in Vietnam with their children over Chinese New Year when he heard how some people were reselling face masks for a profit. ""Having gone through SARS, we know it's crucial to prepare not only for our family and friends but the public too,"" said Mr Tan. Mr Tan and his wife roped in the help of friends and family, visited multiple pharmacies over three days in Vietnam, and purchased more than 10,000 masks for about S$1,000.  When Mr Tan and his family returned to Singapore, they organised their first giveaway at Punggol MRT station on Jan 31, distributing 4,000 masks. They distributed the remaining 6,000 masks at Punggol MRT station on Feb 1. Initially, Mr Tan limited the face masks to 10 per person, but later reduced it to five in order to accommodate more people. His actions also prompted his wife's friends, also residents of Punggol, to contribute funds for newer batches of face masks. An additional 7,000 masks were distributed on Feb 4, with another giveaway planned for Feb 8. Mr Tan says that the reaction from the public has been good, with many thanking him for his contribution. ""We believe that the kampung spirit is still alive, we just need to set an example,"" said Mr Tan.

06 Feb 2020 06:28AM,Commentary: Looks like containment of novel coronavirus not as effective as we had hoped,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Critical differences between the epidemiology of the novel coronavirus and SARS make containment less effective as a strategy and mitigation more urgent, says Hitoshi Oshitani. TOKYO: A novel coronavirus is rapidly spreading within China, with more cases discovered outside the country this past week. The virus is genetically close to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus , which caused a global outbreak in 2002 to 2003. Despite their similarities, however, this new virus shares few epidemiological characteristics with SARS, which was successfully contained after causing more than 8,000 cases with 774 deaths worldwide. This new virus may be more difficult to control than SARS. The number of cases has already exceeded the total number of cases of SARS – and in just one month. It is likely that the Wuhan health authorities tried to contain the new virus using the same strategy previously used for the containment of SARS. However, containment by these means looks like an less effective means to deal with this new virus compared to SARS. We have insufficient epidemiological data to understand the whole epidemiology of this novel coronavirus because we are still in the early stages of its spread. At this time, however, we have seen some critical differences between the epidemiology of SARS and this virus that may make this much more difficult to manage than SARS. HOW EFFECTIVE IS CONTAINMENT? Active and comprehensive discovery of infected individuals, rapid isolation of cases, and identification of all close contacts by contact tracing were the fundamental strategies for the containment of SARS. However, several conditions must be met for this containment strategy to be effective.   First, the majority of the infected individuals must develop typical, identifiable clinical symptoms that can be used to distinguish between the target disease and other infections. Second, only those with typical clinical symptoms can infect others. Third, infected individuals are contagious only in the late stage of illness. For SARS, these conditions were met, and quick containment was therefore possible. Most infected individuals developed severe viral pneumonia, which was distinguishable from other infections such as seasonal influenza. Furthermore, only those with severe and typical symptoms could infect others. Finally, infected individuals were contagious only in the late stage of illness. Therefore, we were able to identify most infected individuals and isolate them as soon as they developed symptoms to prevent further transmission. Eventually, all chains of transmission were interrupted, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global containment of SARS on Jul 5, 2003 - eight months after the emergence of the virus. PROBLEMS WITH CONTAINMENT In contrast, the containment strategy used for SARS has not been successful in containing this novel coronavirus. This is because this virus does not meet the aforementioned necessary conditions. Unlike SARS, some or many infected individuals developed only mild or no symptoms, precluding the identification of all possible cases. In Singapore, some Singaporeans who had come into contact with a group of Chinese tourists were diagnosed with the infection, despite two not having any signs of pneumonia when they first presented themselves to healthcare facilities.   In Japan, five out of the 565 evacuees from China tested positive for the virus despite not having any symptoms. Furthermore, limited evidence suggests that infected individuals with mild or no symptoms can be contagious. Asymptomatic infected individuals may not be a driving force for the ongoing outbreak due to a lower chance of successful transmission compared to symptomatic cases. However, if an asymptomatic individual becomes a source of the transmission chain, then contact tracing cannot be used to identify such a chain. This is a critical problem for containment. Some accounts of transmission suggest that individuals are contagious even during the incubation period, which is the duration between exposure and the onset of symptoms. There is documented evidence indicating that a traveller from China passed the virus to some of her colleagues during the incubation period in Germany, which the science community is debating over. If cases are infectious during the incubation period, it may be too late to prevent further transmission, even if we can isolate patients soon after they develop symptoms. The majority of individuals infected with SARS did not infect any other persons. During that outbreak in Singapore in 2003, more than 80 per cent of infected individuals did not pass the virus to anyone else.   There were some “super-spreader events” in which one infected individual infected many others. These were the major amplifying factor for SARS. So far, no “super-spreading event” has been documented for the novel coronavirus, but more data is needed before we can rule out such an event. Because possibly only a small fraction of cases are being detected and reported, it is difficult to know the exact transmissibility between individuals for this virus. Due to the rapidly increasing number of cases in mainland China, its transmissibility is considered to be higher than that of SARS. In addition, the world of 2020 is quite different compared to that of 2003. Many more international flights now depart from China to many more countries than before. While SARS spread to more than 30 countries and areas within eight months, the novel coronavirus has spread to more than 20 countries within one month. No sustained human-to-human transmission has been reported outside mainland China. However, “invisible transmission chains” may already have been established in some countries. Therefore, we may see a sudden increase in the number of cases when such transmission chains are fully realised. This is becoming a real possibility. SHIFT TO MITIGATION Because containment appears less feasible and effective, we must shift our objective to mitigate the impact. Thus, the most important goal right now is to reduce the mortality rate to be as low as possible. Every country should be prepared for an increasing number of severe cases. This may be more challenging in countries with limited healthcare resources. We urgently need to establish a mechanism to support these countries. It is difficult to predict how the outbreak will evolve in China and other countries, but an imminent risk persists of large outbreaks outside of China. The international community should work together, and China has a critical role in this battle. Other countries can learn from China’s current experience. For example, we must learn and distribute what measures are effective or ineffective. The WHO should continue to play a leading role for international coordination, especially with China, to fight against this global threat.

13 Feb 2020 06:11AM,"F&B, retail businesses in CBD feel pinch as people work from home amid coronavirus concerns","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Valentine’s Day is the occasion when Mdm Wong Li Hua makes the most money in the year. But the florist was visibly frustrated when she spoke to CNA. Sales at her shop at The Arcade have fallen by 50 per cent compared to the same period last year after Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) alert level to Orange last Friday, Mdm Wong said. Since the announcement, companies islandwide commenced their business continuity plans to limit the spread of the COVID-19. Many, including the financial institutions and technology giants that have offices in the Central Business District (CBD), have arranged to split employees’ shifts or have them work from home. Besides fewer walk-in customers because those who work in the area are staying at home, the closure of the linkways between The Arcade and Clifford Centre has caused some confusion among her customers, Mdm Wong said.   Some who finally made their way to her shop said they thought her store was closed, the florist said. “Who isn’t worried,” Mdm Wong said in Mandarin of the virus creating a dent in her business. “Every year, we rely on this occasion to earn money.” At lunchtime on Wednesday (Feb 12) afternoon, the CBD was still visibly bustling with office workers, but most owners and staff of the 13 eateries and retailers located in the area CNA spoke to said that sales are down anywhere between 10 and 50 per cent since the beginning of this week. Other shopkeepers at The Arcade also saw a dip in sales. At minimart Haja T&T Trading, its owner Haja Aladudeen said that against last week's records, his daily takings have tumbled by 40 per cent. He does not know what to do to shore up his business and can only fret in the meantime, he said.   ZTP Ginseng Birdnest supervisor Loh Ken Tiam said that the Chinese medicinal shop has seen daily earnings dip by 30 per cent compared to last week. On a normal day, the shop takes in about S$2,000 to S$3,000, he said. Over at Tanjong Pagar, the situation was similar. Tomy Chen, the co-owner of Pho Stop at Downtown Gallery, said that sales fell by 20 per cent on Monday, and 30 per cent on Tuesday and Wednesday compared to the same period last week. If dine-in sales continue to fall, Mr Chen said some staff will be transferred to their delivery kitchens located at Lavender and Katong. He is hoping that an increase in demand for food deliveries will offset the dip at their CBD outlet. Lum Von-Nie, who runs the Basil & Mint hawker stall at Amoy Road Food Centre, said that delivery orders have helped to cushion some of the dip in revenue. For example, she earned 20 per cent less on Tuesday week-on-week, but deliveries cut her losses by 10 per cent.   “It’s good that the authorities are quick to respond to false news, so hopefully that helps assure the public that there is no reason not to eat out,” Ms Lum, who runs the stall alone, said, “But yes, (I’m) bracing for the worst."" It is a difficult situation to be in, especially as F&B businesses operate on thin profit margins, said Mr Willin Low, owner of Relish@Frasers Tower. His lunch business has dropped by 45 to 55 per cent. Mr Low said he is in talks with other restaurant owners to see if they can come up with a plan collectively to tide through this period. “Hopefully regular customers and landlords will support restaurants to keep them in business,” he added. But for some others, it is business as usual. One Korean grocery store shop assistant, who asked not to be named as he was not authorised to speak, said that sales have been brisk, especially over the weekend when people came to stock up on rice and instant noodles. OFFICE STAFF WORKING FROM HOME Last Friday, the Singapore Government moved the DORSCON status to Orange. The Ministry of Health urged companies to “step up” their business continuity plan, with suggestions that employees could telecommute or be divided into separate teams. Banks, technology firms and property consultancies with offices in the CBD have heeded the advice and kickstarted their segregation strategies. United Overseas Bank (UOB) said in a media statement on Monday (Feb 10) that it activated its business continuity plans for all critical functions and services, with employees working from split sites, from home and on split shifts. Similar measures have been put in place at DBS, according to a spokesperson. Its 12,000 employees across Singapore, either work from home or from separate sites. A DBS employee was confirmed on Wednesday to be infected by the coronavirus, prompting the bank to evacuate 300 of its staff members from its offices on the 43rd floor at Tower 3 of Marina Bay Financial Centre.   Twitter, whose Asia-Pacific headquarters is located in CapitaGreen, said that they have a “cross-functional operational taskforce in place (to) take necessary measures, including work from home policies, to protect our people and our business operations”. Tech giant Facebook said that they have “taken steps to protect the health and safety of our employees”, although the company already has a flexible working approach in place. Microsoft noted a similar arrangement in their response. Facebook and Microsoft’s Singapore offices are located at Marina One and Frasers Towers, respectively. Real estate firm Colliers International, which has 350 employees in Singapore and an office in Asia Square, said that it has encouraged all its staff to work from home following the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. “This flexible work arrangement will remain in place until the end of March 2020 and we will review the need to extend it,” its managing director Tang Wei Leng said. Staff based at CBRE’s offices are also split into teams who are either working from home or at the office, the company said. Employees who are pregnant and those with prior respiratory conditions will work from home. The property consultancy has about 1,600 employees in Singapore. Four hundred are based in one of its two offices at Paya Lebar Quarter or Six Battery Road. The rest of the estimated 1,200 are based off-site in clients’ offices.

31 Jan 2020 10:08PM,"Wuhan coronavirus, Singapore's emergency preparedness to be discussed in Parliament","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The Wuhan coronavirus and Singapore's medical emergency preparedness are among the issues to be discussed when Parliament sits on Monday (Feb 3). Two Bills will be introduced during the sitting for the first time, The Hindu Endowments (Amendment) Bill and the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) (Amendment) Bill. Six will be tabled for a second reading, including the Singapore Convention on Mediation Bill and the Active Mobility (Amendment) Bill, which seeks to extend the e-scooter ban on footpaths to all motorised personal mobility devices (PMDs). MPs have submitted more than 50 questions on a range of issues, with several MPs such as Desmond Choo, Rahayu Mahzam and Liang Eng Hwa asking about the Government’s measures to deal with the Wuhan coronavirus should the outbreak worsen in Singapore. The virus, which originated in China’s central Hubei province, has killed more than 200 people and infected nearly 10,000, mostly in China. The Ministry of Health on Friday announced confirmed 16 cases in Singapore, including one Singaporean, as authorities widened travel restrictions to combat the spread of the coronavirus. SINGAPORE'S EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS Singapore’s medical preparedness is also in the spotlight after the Lucky Plaza car accident, where the victims were taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital instead of the nearby Mount Elizabeth Hospital, which was not equipped to handle severe trauma patients. MP Joan Pereira is asking if the Government will consider requiring all private and public hospitals to be equipped and manned to handle severe and multiple trauma cases in their accident and emergency departments as part of Singapore’s emergency preparedness plan. Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) Daniel Goh will ask whether the emergency departments of private hospitals should be upgraded for a tiered national accident and emergency system. As Australia declares a state of emergency over the bushfires threatening large parts of the country, climate and other environmental issues are some of the issues that will be discussed. MP Seah Kian Peng will ask if the Australian bushfires have threatened Singapore's environment and food security. NCMP Dennis Tan will ask if the Government has any plans on reducing greenhouse emissions from Singapore's oil refining industry, while MP Louis Ng will ask if the Government could publish its collection of the 2019 carbon tax payments. On other issues, NCMP Leon Perera will ask about the reasons for the discoloured tap water in the Basic Military Training Camp (BMTC) on Pulau Tekong last year and what measures are being taken to reduce the risk of such an incident in future. He will also ask what the Government is doing to address attitudes of students and educators towards the sexual objectification and harassment of women, in light of concerns over voyeurism cases at institutes of higher learning. MP Cheng Li Hui will suggest that the Government conduct a review of the funeral industry in Singapore, after a mix-up resulted in the wrong body being cremated. MP Christopher de Souza will also ask about the rise in piracy and robbery cases in the Singapore Strait and its surrounding waters. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

04 Feb 2020 05:53PM,"Thailand confirms 6 new cases of novel coronavirus, including 4 Thais","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BANGKOK: Thailand confirmed six new cases of the new coronavirus on Tuesday (Feb 4), four of them Thai nationals and two Chinese, bringing the total to 25, the highest number outside China. The four Thais included a couple who visited Japan and two drivers who picked up Chinese passengers in Thailand, Suwannachai Wattanayingcharoenchai, director-general of the Department of Disease Control, told reporters. It was not clear whether the couple contracted the virus in Japan or after returning, Suwannachai said. One of the infected Thai drivers, a 70-year-old, also had tuberculosis and was transferred into government care from a private hospital on Monday with worse condition than the others. The other driver was tracked down by Thai authorities after being identified as one of the people in contact with an infected Chinese tourist, Suwannachai said. Thailand confirmed its first case of human-to-human transmission on Friday when a taxi driver tested positive. Thailand's total 25 cases consist of six Thais and 19 Chinese. Seventeen remain in hospital and eight have gone home, according to the health official. Earlier on Tuesday, South Korea reported a 42-year-old woman has tested positive for coronavirus after visiting Thailand. It was not clear yet where she had contracted the virus.

01 Feb 2020 07:55PM,"Avoid speculating, spreading 'unfounded rumours' on Wuhan coronavirus: NEA","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The National Environment Agency (NEA) on Saturday (Feb 1) advised members of the public to not speculate or spread ""unfounded rumours"" regarding the Wuhan coronavirus. Referring to a circulating text message that contains a list of ""places to avoid"" in Singapore, NEA said that there is no need for members of the public to avoid these locations. The text message that is currently being shared on messaging platforms such as WhatsApp and Telegram includes the names of hotels, hospitals and shopping centres that have been purportedly exposed to confirmed cases in Singapore. “We would like to assure the public that NEA officers have been liaising closely with, and providing support to, residents and owners of premises, to ensure that the cleaning and disinfection of areas are done in accordance with our guidelines. ""We have also issued sanitation and hygiene advisories to premises and facilities with high public access like hotels and F&B outlets, including hawker centres,"" NEA said.  Singapore has reported 18 cases of the infection as of Saturday. Many of the confirmed cases are visitors to Singapore and have been to locations such as Orchard Road, Gardens by the Bay and Sentosa. Acting clinical director for the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Dr Shawn Vasoo told CNA that rumours claiming members of the public can get the coronavirus infection from walking through certain places is “categorically untrue”.  “You don't get infection typically from places, but from infected persons. So I would say that the messages that have been going out on WhatsApp and other social media … we should not be spreading them because it causes an unnecessary degree of paranoia and worry amongst people. “You only get infected by, typically, by an infected person and you have to be in quite close contact with the person,” he said. Dr Vasoo also said that “close contact” typically refers to people who are living in the same household, those who are caring for someone who might be infected, or those who are the same space for a prolonged period of time. Transient contact – for example, walking past someone in a public space – is not considered close contact and the likelihood for infection for that is probably minuscule, he added.

All the attendees at the Jan 20 to Jan 22 private business meeting were from one company, said MOH. Of the participants, 15 were Singapore residents and 94 were from overseas. Four of the 15 Singapore residents reported having symptoms and have been referred to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases for assessment, said MOH. The remaining 11 are well. All of the foreign participants have left Singapore, said MOH, adding that it has informed the relevant overseas health authorities. Malaysia announced on Tuesday that a 42-year-old Malaysian man who had been at the business meeting developed symptoms on Jan 29 and subsequently tested positive for the coronavirus on Feb 3. Malaysian authorities are tracking his close contacts. On Wednesday, South Korea reported that two of its citizens - a 38-year-old man and a 36-year-old man - who had attended the business meeting at the hotel had also been infected.   A spokesman for the Grand Hyatt Hotel confirmed on Wednesday that the Malaysian had stayed at the hotel for a week in mid-January. He added that the hotel has been deep cleaned and it is not aware of any other cases among its hotel guests or staff. The coronavirus have killed nearly 500 people and infected more than 24,000 in China. The disease is believed to have emerged in December in a Wuhan market that sold wild animals, and spread rapidly as people travelled for the Chinese New Year holiday in January.

11 Feb 2020 05:55AM,Cleared for discharge: What we know about the coronavirus patients who recovered in Malaysia,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners KUALA LUMPUR: Three patients in Malaysia who tested positive for the novel coronavirus have been discharged from hospital after making a full recovery. They have now been cleared for return to their home country. The trio of Chinese nationals have been referred to the Chinese Embassy in Malaysia for further consular assistance, a spokesperson from Malaysia's Ministry of Health said in response to CNA's queries on Monday (Feb 10). Once they land in China, they will be subject to medical screening conducted by the Chinese authorities, which will then share their latest condition with Malaysia. The spokesperson confirmed that contact tracing for all three discharged patients have been completed. Three people linked to Case 6, 17 people linked to the Case 4 and 17 linked to Case 10 were tracked. All were asymptomatic, the spokesperson added. Here is what we know about the three discharged cases: CASE 6 Who: A four-year-old girl from Guangdong, China. She was discharged from Langkawi’s Sultanah Maliha Hospital on Feb 4.   Details: Together with her parents and younger sister, the girl arrived at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Jan 20 and travelled to Langkawi on Jan 24. Both children developed fever, cough and flu, and sought medical treatment at the hospital on Jan 26. She tested positive for the novel coronavirus on Jan 28 and was treated in an isolation ward, while the test result was negative for her sister. Subsequently, during the treatment phase, two clinical samples were taken and she tested negative for the virus. She was the first novel coronavirus patient in Malaysia to make a full recovery. The ministry said her case proved that those infected may be treated and it was possible for patients to recover completely, as reported among many other cases in China. “Many believe that this virus would be fatal to those infected but this is not accurate,” the ministry said in a statement. Malaysian media reported that the girl and her family flew back to Guangzhou from Kuala Lumpur on Sunday morning.   CASE 4 Who: A 40-year-old man from Wuhan, China. He was discharged from Johor’s Permai Hospital on Feb 8. Details: He arrived in Johor Bahru on Jan 22 after travelling by bus from Singapore. The bus carried 17 tourists including the man’s wife and child, authorities said. He developed a fever on Jan 23 and was warded the next day for high fever and pneumonia. His condition worsened the next day, and he required additional oxygen support. The Crisis Preparedness and Response Centre received a report on Jan 25 that he tested positive for the coronavirus. The hospital began treating him with antiviral medicine Kaletra, an HIV drug, on Jan 28. After eight days of treatment, the patient’s condition improved and he fully recovered. He tested negative three times for the novel coronavirus and was discharged on Saturday evening.   CASE 10 Who: A 63-year-old man from Wuhan, China. He was discharged from Kuala Lumpur Hospital on Feb 9. Details: The man arrived in Malaysia via Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Jan 18. He was down with light fever on Jan 23 and received outpatient treatment in a private hospital in Kuala Lumpur. His case was referred to the Health Ministry and he was placed under home surveillance for 14 days. He was sent to Kuala Lumpur Hospital as his fever persisted. He tested positive on Feb 3. He was stable and received symptomatic treatment and continuous monitoring. He did not require antiviral medication. Health Director-General Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah confirmed he tested negative for the virus on two tests conducted on Feb 7 and Feb 8. POSSIBLE FOR CASES TO RELAPSE: HEALTH MINISTER As of Monday, Malaysia has a total of 18 confirmed cases, of whom 12 are Chinese nationals. When asked if a relapse was possible for patients who recovered from the coronavirus, Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad said in a press conference on Monday that it could happen. “We are monitoring very closely ... The is a possibility of relapse, but so far we have not seen this in any of our patients. “Once you have contracted this, you would built up the immunity. For you to go from positive to negative means you have enough immunity to ward off the virus. “However, if a relapse happens, within a short time frame, then it’s something new which we need to learn from. To date though, there have been no findings in that direction,"" he said.

12 Feb 2020 07:10AM,"China reports 97 new deaths from coronavirus, bringing toll to more than 1,100","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The death toll from a coronavirus outbreak in mainland China had reached 1,113 as of the end of Tuesday (Feb 11), up by 97 from the previous day, the country's National Health Commission said on Wednesday. The central Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, reported 94 new deaths. This includes 72 deaths in the provincial capital of Wuhan, where the virus first emerged. Across mainland China, there were 2,015 new confirmed infections on Tuesday, the lowest since Jan 30. The total accumulated number so far has reached 44,653. The new virus is believed to have emerged last year in a market that sells wild animals in Wuhan. China's senior medical adviser said on Tuesday that the coronavirus outbreak in the country may be over by April, and the latest numbers of new cases may further feed that optimism.  The virus was officially named ""COVID-19"" at a conference in Geneva held by the World Health Organization, where the body's chief said countries had a chance of stopping its global spread. WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Tuesday that although 99 per cent of cases are in China, where it remains ""very much an emergency"", it also ""holds a very grave threat for the rest of the world"". He urged countries to share data in order to further research the disease. Chinese authorities dismissed two senior health officials from Hubei on Tuesday, where tens of millions of people have been under lockdown since late last month, and tightened restrictions in Wuhan.

31 Jan 2020 05:01PM,"Wuhan coronavirus: 1,500 SAF personnel packing 5.2m masks in 24-hour operation","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: A total of 1,500 Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) personnel are packing 5.2 million surgical masks for distribution to the public, as Singapore continues its fight against the Wuhan coronavirus. The round-the-clock packing operation at the SAFTI Military Institute started on Thursday (Jan 30) evening after the multi-ministerial task force announced that each Singapore household will receive a pack of four masks. The SAF will use large vans and operational utility vehicles to deliver the masks to 89 Residents' Committee centres and Community Centres, after which the People's Association (PA) will distribute them to the public.  The SAF personnel are working eight-hour shifts, with each shift expected to pack 200,000 masks. They will aim to deliver the first batch of masks on Friday evening and finish the operation by Saturday evening.   Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said the SAF is “very aware” that all agencies in Singapore have to “lean forward” to do its part in tackling the Wuhan coronavirus. “Every new biological outbreak can be very serious if we are not quick enough to take up the right measures,” he told reporters at the packing area on Friday. This comes as Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said on Thursday that there is a sufficient supply of masks in Singapore if managed properly, amid concerns over a lack of availability at retailers islandwide. Many people in Singapore are donning surgical masks as a form of protection against the coronavirus, although experts have cautioned it could create a ""false sense of security"" if not used properly. FACTORY LINE On Friday, 450 servicemen wearing gloves, masks and hair nets sat at rows of tables in a large hall – chosen for its sterile environment and proximity to a transport line. Servicemen who leave the hall have to sanitise their hands before returning to the tables. They removed masks from a small box and placed four of them in a Ziploc bag. These then go into a larger carton that can contain 400 of such bags. Each van can carry up to 14,000 bags.   Other servicemen help to pack the large cartons and move them to vehicles waiting outside. After this 8am shift ends at 4pm, another will take over. The SAF personnel include non-uniformed staff as well as full-time national servicemen and regulars from the Combat Service Support Command. Dr Ng said the servicemen took a few hours after being activated to prepare the entire set-up, including getting materials like masks, ziploc bags and packing boxes from various agencies. Nevertheless, he said the servicemen were “on track” with their progress, adding that they were in good spirits.   “You know that when you do this, you’re doing it to protect your family and fellow Singaporeans, and you’re very proud of it,” he stated. It is not the first time the SAF is conducting such an operation – during the haze crisis in 2013, it packed and distributed more than 1 million masks to the public through the PA. CONTACT TRACING, TEMPERATURE SCREENING The SAF is also helping out in other areas of the battle against the Wuhan coronavirus. Dr Ng said that as part of contact tracing, SAF personnel are making a hundred calls a day to people in Singapore who have travelled to Hubei province recently to ask about their condition. They are also manning thermal imagery equipment at airports and will inform airport staff if they detect symptomatic passengers. The minister stressed that these SAF personnel are not in direct contact with passengers, adding that they were not trained to do so.   Dr Ng had also said in a Facebook post on Thursday that the SAF is using its premises for quarantine cases. On Friday, he said the SAF is “careful” to ensure it maintains operational readiness even as it deploys resources to contain the Wuhan coronavirus. “Even though it’s a national effort, we want to make sure that the SAF keeps its eye on its primary responsibility,” he said. “We will not compromise security, even though this is important, and that is why we mobilised the Combat Service Support Command, whereas other operational units are still on tasking.” When asked if there are SAF servicemen currently in China, Dr Ng said the SAF has instructed personnel to defer non-essential travel to the country, adding that there were also no upcoming bilateral exercises with China. ""Even if (the trip to China is) important, they have to get clearance,"" he added.

11 Feb 2020 03:43PM,HK banks unveil relief measures for mortgage borrowers hit by coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners HONG KONG: At least two banks in Hong Kong have introduced relief measures for home mortgage borrowers hurt by the coronavirus outbreak, in a move analysts say could help lower foreclosures in an economy already in recession. Bank of China (Hong Kong) and Standard Chartered have said mortgage customers may apply to pay only interest, and not principal, for up to six months, subject to an extension of another six months. ""This is an effort to relieve the pressure of making monthly repayments for the individual and commercial customers who are more severely affected by the novel coronavirus outbreak, including but not limited to those in retail, food and beverage, logistics, tourism, hospitality and entertainment industries,"" Bank of China (Hong Kong) said in a statement. Months of sometimes violent anti-government protests in Hong Kong last year plunged its economy into its first recession in a decade. Analysts predict a worse start to 2020 for the financial hub as travel curbs to fight the spread of the virus deal a further blow to tourism, retail and other business. Hong Kong Airlines, the city's No. 2 carrier, has already flagged plans to slash 400 jobs and cut operations given weak travel demand due to the outbreak. The impact on Hong Kong's economy from the new epidemic could be worse than in 2003 when it was hit by another coronavirus, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), its financial secretary has warned, with unemployment set to rise. The new coronavirus can be transmitted from person to person and has infected more than 40,000 and claimed over 1,000 lives in mainland China, exceeding the global toll of 800 during SARS. Hong Kong has confirmed 42 cases of coronavirus. Against this backdrop, more banks are expected to follow suit with easing measures for mortgage borrowers to prevent 2003-like foreclosures, mReferral Mortgage Brokerage Services Senior Vice President Eric Tso said. But property agents do not expect foreclosures in Hong Kong to exceed 2003 levels, when 5,700 were recorded, as the current loan ratio is much lower. Data shows the mortgage delinquency ratio was 0.03 per cent at end-December, with the estimated number of residential mortgage loans in negative equity at 128. Private home prices in the city, one of the world's most expensive, eased again in December and property agents expect the trend to continue in the next few months.

""China domestic and worldwide travel restrictions are posing some logistical challenges. The Tianjin Final Assembly Line facility is currently closed,"" Airbus said in a statement. The Tianjin facility, the first of its kind for Airbus outside Europe, is a completion centre for single aisle A320 aircraft and can also handle the larger A330. Tianjin is a port city 150km from Beijing. Airbus did not indicate when the centre might reopen. ""Airbus is constantly evaluating the situation and monitoring any potential knock-on effects to production and deliveries and will try to mitigate via alternative plans where necessary,"" the company said in a statement. French aeronautics and defence contractor Safran has also closed its production facilities in China over the coronavirus crisis, a spokeswoman told AFP. Safran employs 2,500 people across some 20 different Chinese sites, which will remain closed until Feb 10, the company said. More than 20 countries have confirmed cases of the virus, which has infected more than 24,000 people in mainland China. The outbreak has prompted the World Health Organization to declare a global health emergency, several governments to impose travel restrictions, and airlines to suspend flights to and from China.

Of those, 60 per cent or 302 people were under quarantine at home, while the remaining 222 were in government quarantine facilities (GQF), he said in a ministerial statement. GQFs include government-linked chalets, university hostels and Singapore Armed Forces premises. They are used to house people who have had close contact with confirmed cases of the virus and recent travellers from Hubei. ""Persons under quarantine are required to stay in their designated location at all times during the quarantine period,"" said Mr Wong. ""They cannot physically interact with others living in the same premise."" The new coronavirus, which originated in China’s Wuhan, has killed more than 360 people and infected more than 17,000. There have been 18 confirmed cases in Singapore, all with recent travel history to Hubei province, where virus epicentre Wuhan is located. Beyond the confirmed cases, 240 suspect cases have tested negative for the virus, with test results pending for another 43 suspect cases.  Mr Wong said the quarantine and leave of absence (LOA) measures help to reduce the risk of community spread and protect Singaporeans from the spread of the virus. For quarantine cases, Mr Wong said that authorities will assess whether the person should be quarantined at home or GQFs depending how suitable the home is. ""We would use video calls, phone calls and regular spot checks to ensure that they remain in their assigned quarantine location,"" he said. ""These are protocols that we have worked out through SARS and fine-tuned over the years."" Mr Wong added that there are severe penalties for non-compliance of the quarantine order, including fines or jail time.  As for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders on the 14-day LOA after returning from other parts of China, Mr Wong said they are expected to remain in their residence ""as much as possible"". They should also minimise visitors and maintain a record of persons they come into close contact with, he said. ""They also need to minimise time spent in public places and contact with others, monitor their health and temperature daily, and avoid crowded places or social gatherings,"" he added. ""They may resume normal activities only after they have served their LOA, if they remain well.""  Despite these measures, Mr Wong said he's received feedback that some residents, after learning of a home quarantine or LOA case in the same apartment block, have asked that the person be moved elsewhere. There have also been reports of landlords stigmatising tenants based on their nationality, or evicting Chinese national tenants on LOA, he said. ""I can appreciate that Singaporeans are very concerned about the well-being of themselves and their family members, but if landlords start turning tenants away, then our overall containment efforts will be much harder, and we end up endangering ourselves and others,"" said Mr Wong. ""The outcome will be completely counter-productive. So we should not condone such irresponsible actions which will put Singapore and Singaporeans at greater risk. ""In such difficult times, we should not let our fears overwhelm us and cause us to overreact. Instead let us support each other and look out for one another, so that we can all get through this together."" It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Copyright© Mediacorp 2020.

01 Feb 2020 05:32AM,"US declares coronavirus a public health emergency, bans travellers from China","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners WASHINGTON: The US said Friday it was declaring a public health emergency and temporarily banning the entry of foreign nationals who had travelled to China over the past two weeks to contain the spread of a deadly new virus. Sweeping new restrictions will also be imposed on American citizens, with those returning from the province at the disease's epicentre placed in facilities for mandatory 14-day quarantines, said Health Secretary Alex Azar. US citizens coming from other parts of China will undergo health screening at ports of entry and then be placed under monitored self-quarantine at home. ""I have today declared that the coronavirus presents a public health emergency in the United States,"" said Azar during a briefing at the White House, adding the directives would take effect on Feb 2 from 5pm eastern time (2200 GMT). ""Foreign nationals, other than immediate family of US citizens and permanent residents, who have travelled in China within the last 14 days will be denied entry into the United States for this time,"" he added. The restrictions apply to people who have travelled to the designated areas in the two weeks prior to their attempted entry. There have been six confirmed US cases of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus, which originated in a live seafood market in Wuhan, in Hubei province, in December. The World Health Organization has already declared the epidemic a global emergency, and the Chinese death toll rose Friday to 213 while total infections reached nearly 10,000, surpassing the SARS epidemic of two decades ago. Three US airlines, American, Delta and United said they would soon suspend all flights to China. FIRST FEDERAL QUARANTINE IN 50 YEARS Earlier, officials imposed mandatory 14-day quarantine orders on 195 Americans who were air evacuated from Wuhan, the first time a federal directive of this kind was issued for more than 50 years. The last case involved a person who was evaluated for smallpox in the 1960s. A plane carrying the repatriated citizens, who include diplomats and their families, touched down at the March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, California, on Wednesday and officials initially said the passengers would be asked to voluntarily isolate themselves for up to 72 hours. Early signs were good, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) declared that none of the individuals showed symptoms of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. One of the individuals tried to leave the base and was placed under quarantine by the state of California, said CDC official Marty Citron, before the federal action. QUESTIONS OVER TEST ACCURACY The repatriated group submitted samples for testing at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta - but officials now say they are not certain about the accuracy of their diagnostic tools. ""We are seeing in the cases that are in the hospital, we've seen people who had detectable virus, and they didn't have the technical virus, and then three days later they had detectable virus,"" said Robert Redfield, the CDC's director. Given that the extent of asymptomatic transmission was not yet clear, a negative test was not being used as a release criteria. ""It isn't like it's a horrible test, but it is not a test that's absolute,"" added CDC immunologist Anthony Fauci. Despite the seemingly drastic actions, the US public ""should not let fear or panic guide your actions,"" said senior CDC official Nancy Messonnier, but instead exercise normal precautions for stopping the spread of respiratory viruses. These include washing your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds, disinfecting surfaces, staying home when sick and covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue and then throwing it in the trash. ""We do not currently recommend the use of facemasks for the general American public,"" said Messonnier. ""This virus is not spreading in your communities."" ""Please do not assume that just because someone is of Asian descent that they have this new coronavirus,"" she added, noting there are four million Chinese Americans in the US.

Most of the country's deaths and overall cases have been in Hubei, a populous province in China's centre. The top Communist Party official in Wuhan, the central city of 11 million people where the virus first emerged in December, on Friday expressed ""remorse"" because local authorities acted too slowly. The virus is believed to have emerged in December in the provincial capital of Wuhan in a meat market that sold wild game. Last week, China's central government finally jumped into action, effectively sealing off Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province, and curbing travel across the nation of 1.4 billion people. But the epidemic has spread far and wide as Chinese people travelled across the country and abroad over the Chinese New Year holiday that started last week. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a global health emergency, but said it was not recommending any international trade or travel restrictions. It has since ballooned into a global health emergency with cases in more than 20 countries. Countries have scrambled to evacuate their nationals from Wuhan, with hundreds of US, Japanese, British, French and South Korean citizens evacuated so far, and more countries planning airlifts. A flight carrying more than 300 Indian nationals left Wuhan in the early hours of Saturday for New Delhi. About 200 US evacuees who landed in California on Wednesday have been put under a rare mandatory quarantine order for 14 days. US carriers American, United and Delta joined other airlines suspending flights to China, following the State Department travel advisory. Russia said it would evacuate more than 2,500 of its citizens holidaying on China's Hainan island, far from the epicentre of the outbreak, a day after sealing its remote far-eastern border.

02 Feb 2020 04:24PM,"Wuhan coronavirus: Licence fees waived for hotels, travel agents and tour guides, cleaning costs subsidised","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Licence fees for hotels, travel agents and tour guides will be waived as part of measures to help the tourism sector in Singapore that has been “directly affected” by the Wuhan coronavirus, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) said on Sunday (Feb 2). STB will also defray the cleaning costs of hotels that provided accommodation to the confirmed and suspected cases of the coronavirus infections. These schemes are the first steps in a wider set of measures to help tourism businesses “mitigate the immediate impact” of the coronavirus outbreak, STB added.   These measures come after feedback from trade associations and chambers, said Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing. He said at the Oasia Hotel Downtown: ""I just want to assure the businesses and our workers that the survival of the businesses, and in the turn, the sustainability of the jobs for Singaporeans will be our primary focus."" Oasia Hotel Downtown was where Singapore's 13th confirmed case of the Wuhan virus stayed prior to being tested positive for the coronavirus. The 73-year-old arrived in Singapore on Jan 21 and developed symptoms seven days later. Mr Chan told reporters that Singaporeans should be ""mentally prepared"" for the impact of the coronavirus to be ""wider, deeper and longer"" than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. This is because China's trade with Singapore and its GDP have both gone up four times since then. ""What we must be mentally prepared for is that the impact of any disruption to the Chinese economy, to the supply chains, is likely to be much wider, much deeper, because of the interlinkages with the global economy - certainly with the Singapore economy,"" he said.   ""The tourism sector has already been directly affected by the novel coronavirus, due to a decline in visitor arrivals, especially from China,"" STB said in its media release on Sunday. Tourists from China account for about 20 per cent of Singapore’s total international visitor arrivals, with about 3.6 million visitors to Singapore in 2019, the tourism board added. Earlier this week, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong announced wider travel restrictions to include all new visitors – regardless of nationality – with recent travel history to China. These visitors will also not be allowed to transit in Singapore, as part of restrictions that came into effect at 11.59pm on Saturday. Those with Chinese passports, with the exception of Singapore permanent residents (PRs) and long-term pass holders, will also not be allowed to enter Singapore. All forms of new visas to Chinese passport holders have been suspended, and Singapore’s status as a visa-free transit facility has also been suspended for those with Chinese passports. HELP WITH CLEANING AND LICENCE FEES There have been 18 confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore. Of the 18, 16 are travellers from Wuhan and two are Singaporeans who were evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30. The tourism board said hotels that provided accommodation to suspected and confirmed cases will get help with their environmental cleaning and disinfection costs. “STB will cover up to 50 per cent of third-party professional cleaning fees, capped at S$20,000 per establishment for hotels with confirmed cases; and S$10,000 per establishment for hotels with suspected cases,” the board added. This will be backdated to Jan 23, when the first confirmed case in Singapore was detected. Licence fees for hotels for the rest of 2020 will also be waived by the Hotels Licensing Board. “Similarly, travel agents and tourist guides whose licences are due for renewal in 2020 will not need to pay to renew their licence fees,” STB said. Chief executive of STB Keith Tan said: ""Over the past week, STB has been in close contact with our tourism partners to understand their difficulties and to assess the impact. ""We know the situation is likely to persist, and recognise we need to move quickly to support the industry and build confidence. ""STB will continue to identify targeted and effective ways to support the tourism industry so that they are well-positioned to grow swiftly once we start to recover."" Full details of the overall package of relief measures will be announced at Budget 2020 on Feb 18.   The Government is ""keenly aware"" that some front-line workers are ""particularly worried"" about coming into contact with unwell guests or customers, added Manpower Minister Josephine Teo. She said that the Singapore National Employers Federation and the Singapore Business Federation will issue an advisory to employers with such workers. ""(The advisory will explain) what they can do to provide these workers with support. They need guidance on how to deal with unwell customers, and the advisory will give some specific suggestions,"" she said. Workers who are placed on leave of absences are not unwell and should not be evicted by landlords, co-tenants or dormitory operators, added Mrs Teo. There have been reports of such evictions, Communications and Information Minister S Iswaran had said on Friday. ""There's really no need to do so. It is completely unhelpful. And this is a time where we actually need to provide care and support to each other,"" Mrs Teo said. She noted that placing workers on leave is an extra precaution to minimise social contact. ""We must always be mindful that even as we take these extra precautions, we should be supportive to the people who are affected by the leave of absence,"" she said.

03 Feb 2020 07:29PM,In full: Lawrence Wong's ministerial statement on Singapore's response to novel coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: National Development Minister Lawrence Wong on Monday (Feb 3) delivered a ministerial statement in Parliament on how the Government has put in place ""multiple lines of defence"" against the novel coronavirus in Singapore. Mr Wong, who also co-chairs a multi-ministry taskforce fighting the spread of the virus, added that Singapore needs its citizens to ""play their part"" in tackling the outbreak. This is what he said in full: Mr Speaker, sir, the Minister for Health has spoken about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (or nCoV in short) situation, and explained how we have prepared for this since SARS, as well as the public health measures that we have taken so far. I will now elaborate on the other aspects of the work of the Multi-Ministry Taskforce. The Taskforce was formed just about two weeks ago, and we have been meeting almost daily since then to deal with a very fast moving and constantly changing situation. nCoV is a new virus, and medical experts everywhere are rushing to understand more about how it spreads, how severe it is, and how it can be treated. We constantly update our risk assessments based on the latest information and expert advice. We also look ahead to anticipate as best as we can how the situation will evolve, and prepare for the possibility that things can worsen. That’s why over the past week alone, we’ve had to adjust and update our measures several times. We owe it to every Singaporean to do our very best to protect all of us from this virus. So in all that we do, the overall health and wellbeing of Singaporeans has been and will be our top priority. BORDER CONTROLS As Minister Gan highlighted earlier, the measures we put in place are part of a broader system with multiple lines of defence. Our first line of defence against an infectious disease that occurs outside of Singapore is to put in place controls at the border to limit the spread of the virus and the number of imported cases here. Infectious diseases do not respect borders. The world is more connected than before, with more people flying around and travelling than ever. We have to be extra vigilant on this front because Singapore is an international travel hub, with more than 68 million people using our airport last year. A virus that comes through our airport will not only impact Singapore. It can also easily spread through us to other countries in the region.   So to protect against such an infectious disease outbreak when it happens outside of Singapore, we have a series of drawer plans and measures at the border. They range from the screening of in-bound travellers, to placing high-risk travellers into quarantine, as well as restricting travel for those who have been recently at highrisk countries. Depending on the nature of the outbreak, we will assess the risks and put in place the appropriate measures. This is the approach the Taskforce has taken in dealing with this virus. We first implemented temperature screening at Changi Airport for flights from Wuhan, and then we expanded the screening to all flights from China; and also to our land and sea checkpoints. As an additional precaution, and because not all who are infected will show symptoms, we deployed healthcare teams at the aerobridge for all incoming flights from China to identify and pull aside passengers who look unwell. At the same time, it helped that China itself had moved swiftly to impose restrictions on its own outbound travellers. It cancelled outbound tour groups. All of these measures helped to reduce the flow of people from China to Singapore. Typically, there will be about 14,000 PRC travellers flying in from China to Singapore every day. After the Chinese imposed outbound restrictions on 23 January, this number came down sharply by more than 80 per cent – just through the Chinese measures alone. Despite these measures, we recognised that there was still a flow of travellers coming in from China on a regular basis. We monitored this flow carefully and considered what additional actions were needed based on the evidence and risks. Early last week, when we saw the sharply accelerating trend of infection among the population of Chinese nationals from Hubei province, we knew we had to move. That’s why on Jan 28, we decided to disallow all new visitors with recent travel history in Hubei.   But shortly after that, the situation changed again. While the majority of confirmed cases in China were still linked to Hubei province, it was evident that the virus had spread to every region of mainland China, and there was a high risk of widespread community transmission in other parts of China. So on Jan 31, we decided to take the additional precaution of disallowing all new visitors with recent travel history in the rest of mainland China. As part of these travel restrictions, ICA is no longer issuing new visas to those with PRC passports, and suspending all such visas. That is because the vast majority of such travellers coming in for short visits would have been in China recently. But if there are PRC passport holders who have not been in China in the past 14 days, then ICA will be prepared to issue them a short-term visitor pass or to extend their short-term pass. That’s why I had emphasised earlier that the travel restrictions are not tied to nationality, but are meant to restrict all travellers with recent travel history in China. This is necessary to reduce the flow of people coming from the source of the virus outbreak, and to limit the number of imported cases coming into Singapore. That is our first line of defence at the border. DETECT AND ISOLATE Beyond border controls, our second line of defence is to identify and isolate the people with the virus, as well as all of the close contacts of the infected persons. We have a well-established contact tracing procedure, which we put in place during SARS, and have continued to fine-tune through emergency exercises, and through experiences dealing with previous outbreaks like MERS and H1N1. As of 8am today, we have 18 confirmed cases of the virus, all with recent travel history in Hubei. 16 are PRC nationals, mostly here on short-term passes. The other 2 are Singaporeans, who were among the 92 who came back recently from Wuhan after the city was locked down.   Beyond the confirmed cases, we have tested a broader group of 240 suspect cases, all of whom are negative. There are another 43 suspect cases, for which the test results are pending. All of the outstanding suspect cases have been isolated; the close contacts of the confirmed cases are also now on quarantine. In addition, we have been contacting the recent travellers from Hubei who are presently in Singapore, and putting those of higher risk on quarantine. As of last night, there are 524 persons under quarantine – 222 are in Government Quarantine Facilities (GQF), and 302 are serving quarantine at home. Persons under Quarantine are required to stay in their designated location at all times during the quarantine period. They cannot physically interact with others living in the same premise. For each case, we will assess whether to quarantine the person at the GQFs or to do so at the person’s home. In cases where the home is found to be suitable by MOH, then the home quarantine would apply. We will use video calls, phone calls and regular spot checks to ensure that they remain in their assigned quarantine location. These are protocols that we have all worked out through SARS and fine-tuned over the years. Persons who do not have a suitable residence for quarantine will then be housed in a GQF. There are severe penalties for non-compliance of the Quarantine Order, including fines or jail.   Besides quarantine for close contacts and high-risk groups, we have also taken precautionary measures for recent travellers from other parts of mainland China, outside of Hubei. Our assessment is that they are of lower risk compared to those who were recently in Hubei. For all such returning residents and long-term pass holders, we ask them to take a 14-day Leave of Absence (LOA) from the date of their return. This is one way to reduce their exposure when they are back, and thus reduce the risk of community spread in Singapore. Those on LOA are expected to remain in their residence as much as possible, minimise visitors, and maintain a record of persons they come into close contact with. They also need to minimise time spent in public places and contact with others, monitor their health and temperature daily, and avoid crowded places or social gatherings. We have put out guidelines on what an LOA means, just to ensure that anyone who is on LOA knows what they are expected to do. They may resume normal duties or activities only after they have served their LOA, if they remain well.   We have put in place measures like the Quarantine Orders and Leave of Absence to protect Singaporeans from the spread of the virus. Singaporeans must also do their part to cooperate. Some residents, upon learning that there is a person under home quarantine or LOA in the same apartment block, have asked that this person be moved elsewhere. We’ve also heard feedback of landlords stigmatising tenants based on their nationality, or worse, evicting PRC tenants who are taking their Leave of Absence. I can appreciate that Singaporeans are very concerned about the wellbeing of themselves and their family members. But if landlords start turning tenants away, then our overall containment efforts will be much harder and we end up endangering ourselves and others. The outcome will be completely counterproductive. We should not condone such irresponsible actions that will end up putting Singapore and Singaporeans at greater risk. In such difficult times, we should not let our fears overwhelm us and cause us to overreact. Instead let us support each other and look out for one another, so that we can all get through this together. COMMUNITY AND INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY This brings me to the third line of defence on community and individual responsibility. The Government will do everything we can in this fight against the virus. Many of our officials are going beyond their usual duties to focus on this challenge. They include our healthcare and medical personnel at the frontline; ICA officers manning the checkpoints; the Police and SCDF officers and auxiliary police screening incoming travellers, and safeguarding persons under quarantine; as well as the CAAS and MPA officers at airport and cruise terminals; and many, many more. The whole-of-Government officials are going all out to tackle this.  But all that is not enough. We need every Singaporean to play their part – to take all necessary precautions, and to exercise individual and collective responsibility. For example, employers can help by ensuring their employees who have just returned from China stay at home under LOA. If anyone in the office is sick, employers should immediately ask them to see a doctor, and stay at home to recover. We also have a responsibility, in this time of heightened alert, not to spread unverified information or false news which can cause needless panic and fear. Unfortunately, in recent times, there have been various online posts and articles containing falsehoods. For example that we have run out of masks, that someone in Singapore has died from the virus, and that Woodlands MRT station was shut for disinfection. These are all false – fake news. Fortunately, we now have POFMA to deal with these fake news. The Government has used POFMA to correct them, clarify the facts swiftly, and we will continue to do so to avoid unnecessary panic and anxiety. Even as we address false information, we have stepped up our efforts to provide everyone with timely and accurate information. We try to reach all segments of society through various platforms including broadcast media, display panels in HDB estates, Government websites and social media. We have been using Gov.sg WhatsApp to provide timely updates to Singaporeans in all our official languages. To date, more than 300,000 have signed up for the service. I encourage anyone who has not done so to subscribe and get the latest verified information and advisories.   As the situation continues to evolve, we ask Singaporeans to continue turning to official or credible sources for accurate and up-to-date information. We ask Singaporeans to be discerning, and share only verified information. Together, we can help prevent misinformation and falsehoods from sowing fear and causing panic in our society. At the individual level, it is also essential that all of us continue to uphold good personal hygiene, as emphasised by Minister Gan just now. Wash our hands regularly with soap, do not touch our face with our hands; cover our mouths when we cough or sneeze. If you have flu-like symptoms, avoid public places, and wear a mask on your way to the clinic, so that you do not risk infecting others. We have said these repeatedly, but I think we should all continue to emphasise these points to get the message across. STOCKPILE OF SUPPLIES This brings me to the topic of face masks. To prepare for any emergency, stockpiles of essential items are critical. Over the years, and learning from the experience of SARS and other crises, we have built up a stockpile of surgical and N95 masks. But no stockpile is sufficient if we do not use the supplies judiciously. In the nine days up to end of January, the Government released more than 5 million masks from our stockpiles to the retailers. All were snapped up in a matter of hours. But still there were still people who were not able to get access to a mask. At the same time, with the virus spreading to countries all over the world, there is now a global scramble for masks. Producers around the world are struggling to keep pace with the demand. Some places like Taiwan have even banned the export of masks.   We have existing contracts from various producers to replenish our stockpile. But in light of the current situation, we have to seriously consider the risks of our supply lines being disrupted. Because of the rapid consumption rate that we had seen earlier and the potential threat to our supply lines, we decided to change the method of distribution of masks from our national stockpile. And that’s why firstly, we have slowed down the supply of masks to retailers, and prioritised the masks for essential services, namely our frontline healthcare workers. Secondly, for the general public, we decided to release masks directly from the stockpile to households, so that every family will have access to a mask should someone in the family fall sick and need to use one to see a doctor. The nationwide distribution of the masks was a major exercise in its own right. We mobilised the SAF and PA for this task and they all did a sterling job. Within a very short turnaround time, the SAF had completed the packing of over 5 million masks, and delivered them to our collection points. Our PA staff and grassroots organisations then took to set up the collection centres at CCs and RC centres, and to man the collection counters. Even GovTech chipped in and came up with a “maskgowhere” website, where you can just key in your postal code to get information on where and when to collect the masks. The collection of masks started on 1 Feb, and to date more than 200,000 packs, (or 15 per cent of the total) have been collected. I would like to record my thanks to the SAF, PA and all who have been involved in the smooth and speedy execution of this ongoing exercise.  Let me reiterate once again that there are sufficient supplies of masks in Singapore, as long as they are used responsibly. So let us all do our part to ensure the sustainability of our mask stockpile, so that our frontline healthcare workers will have the necessary supplies to carry out their work. HELP FOR AFFECTED SECTORS AND INDIVIDUALS It has been slightly over a month since the virus outbreak in China and businesses here in Singapore are already feeling the impact. Depending on how the situation evolves, the impact to the economy can further broaden and intensify. The government will therefore extend support and help for our companies and workers. We already provide a quarantine allowance to Singapore-based businesses to cover their employees who are quarantined, and to self-employed Singaporeans/PRs who are in quarantine. MOM and NTUC will also work closely with employers to support any affected workers and to protect their livelihoods. In addition, MSF is working with the community and grassroots organisations to reach out to Singaporeans and PRs under quarantine. We will provide ComCare financial assistance and social support to those in need to tide through this difficult period.   Finally, as DPM Heng said on Saturday, the Government will provide targeted support to the sectors that have been more directly impacted – including tourism and transport, and related industries and firms. In fact the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) has already announced the first set of measures for this sector including the waiver of license fees for hotels, travel agents and tour guides. Besides these specific sectors, we recognise that there will be knock-on impacts on related industries in the event of a broad-based slowdown. So we are working out a package of measures to help viable companies stay afloat and to help workers stay in their jobs. This package of measures will be announced during the Budget. STANDING UNITED As I said at the start, we need all Singaporeans to stand united in this fight against the virus. In a situation like this, fear is sometimes as great a threat to us as the disease itself. We must not allow such fear to paralyse our society. We must never allow our prejudices and our fears to pull apart our society or foster greater division or suspicions. As we did in SARS and other previous challenges over the years, let us find strength and confidence in one another – the strength to carry on with our lives, the strength to support each other and to defeat this virus together. I cited some examples of irresponsible behaviours earlier by landlords chasing out tenants on LOAs. Unfortunately, there are other examples too – people hoarding and profiteering from the sale of masks; people spreading falsehoods online – recently a Whatsapp message has been going around listing places to avoid, completely ignoring the fact that any place exposed to a confirmed case will be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, under supervision by NEA. But still, a list of places to avoid was spread, creating fear and a perception that people should avoid these places. Anti PRC sentiment has also emerged amongst some groups. Online, you can see posts directed against PRC nationals. On the ground, you hear reports of discrimination against PRC nationals, whether its landlords denying them their tenancies, or service providers denying them service. Such actions are not helpful, and they have no place in our society. We are bigger than this in Singapore. And, I hope all of us in this House, regardless of political party, will stand together and do our part to confront and condemn such prejudice and discrimination wherever they exist. But I’m glad these behaviours are still in the minority, they are not representative of the vast majority of Singaporeans. There are many more out there who have been showing us the best of Singapore at work. They are quietly helping our fellow citizens in their own ways. For example, at a recent house visit, I met a resident and asked him if he had collected his masks, and he replied that he did not need them, and he asked for his package to be given to others who are in greater need. And I am sure many members here would have encountered similar residents giving you such feedback. Over the weekend too, we have seen residents who have spontaneously stepped forward, volunteering by themselves or even with their children alongside them, to man the masks collection points as well as to distribute the masks to the homes of their more vulnerable neighbours, especially those with mobility issues. Many Singaporeans are also doing their part to support those who are affected through many selfless acts. In NUS and NTU, the students are helping their friends on Leave of Absence, by delivering food three times a day to them. They are helping to pack and deliver welfare packs, including items like snacks and hot drinks. At NUS, I understand that students are even organising a 24-hour e-gaming tournament to keep the students on LOA occupied. We see shining examples of selfless acts by Singaporeans in the Scoot pilots and crew of TR121 who volunteered to fly the 92 Singaporeans from Wuhan despite the risks to themselves. Two MFA officials volunteered for this assignment, despite the risks. Most of all, we see Singaporeans from all walks of life carrying on with their lives with courage and calmness, in every sector. Our friends from the media are busy covering the news; I’m seeing them almost every day these days – and you see them busy on the ground; correspondents still in China covering the news, providing us with up-to-date information so that we are familiar with the facts and latest developments. Our front-line workers, those in our healthcare institutions, our healthcare workers, our workers at our checkpoints and our airports, our transport workers – all carrying on with their lives quietly, doing whatever they can to fight this virus. So I want to thank everyone for showing that Singaporeans can rise to this occasion, and overcoming this challenging situation together. This is the Singapore Spirit which will enable us to prevail against the virus. At this point, no one can tell for sure how the situation will develop, or how long this will last. But I am confident that we will succeed in this fight, if we stand united – as an effective Government, a cohesive people, and a resolute nation. Mr Speaker, we can and will overcome this challenge together.

06 Feb 2020 09:52PM,"Singapore confirms 2 more coronavirus cases, including 1 who attended Grand Hyatt meeting","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners One of the new patients appears to have no links to previous confirmed cases, said the Ministry of Health. SINGAPORE: Singapore confirmed two new cases of the novel coronavirus on Thursday (Feb 6), bringing the total number of people infected in the country to 30, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said. One of the cases is a 41-year-old Singaporean with no recent travel history to China and who does not appear to be linked with previous confirmed cases, MOH added. He was admitted to Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital on Monday and was confirmed to have the virus at 11pm on Wednesday. According to MOH, the man said he had developed a fever on Jan 28 and visited a GP clinic the next day. On Jan 30, he sought treatment at another GP clinic before being admitted to Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital on Monday. Epidemiological investigations and contact tracing are ongoing to identify individuals who had close contact with this patient, said MOH, and to establish any contact he may have had with confirmed cases in Singapore or travellers from mainland China. CASE 30 ATTENDED GRAND HYATT MEETING Another confirmed case is a 27-year-old Singaporean who also had no recent travel history to China. According to MOH, he is one of the four Singapore residents who are being investigated at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) after attending a private business meeting at Grand Hyatt Singapore from Jan 20 to 22. The meeting included participants from China, including Hubei province, as well as the confirmed cases from Malaysia and South Korea. Subsequent test results confirmed infection with the novel coronavirus on Feb 6 at about 2pm. Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing, MOH said, adding that, once identified, they will also be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. The number of close contacts identified by MOH as of noon on Thursday is 435. Of the 353 still in Singapore, 348 have been contacted and have either been quarantined or isolated, said the health ministry. Efforts are ongoing to reach out to five more close contacts, MOH added. In response to CNA's queries, Grand Hyatt on Friday morning said that none of its employees have been diagnosed as a suspect or confirmed case. ""The hotel is conducting daily temperature checks for all colleagues and contractors whilst entering or exiting the hotel,"" said the spokesperson. ""Our colleagues will continue to remain vigilant in monitoring symptoms among colleagues and guests.""   CONDITION OF TWO EARLIER PATIENTS WORSEN Of the earlier confirmed cases, MOH said that two patients' conditions have worsened, with one in critical condition in the intensive care unit. Another requires additional oxygen support. On Thursday night, the ministry also released new information about case 27, the husband of a salesperson at Yong Thai Hang and one of the locally transmitted cases linked to a Chinese tour group that visited the health products shop. The 45-year-old Singaporean developed symptoms on Feb 1, visited a GP clinic the following day and was subsequently isolated at the NCID. Prior to hospital admission, he stayed at his home at Jalan Bukit Merah and worked as a private hire driver, MOH said. He also visited Tiong Bahru Plaza, Tiong Bahru Market and Beo Crescent Market and Food Centre. ""The risk of infection from transient contact, such as on public transport or in public places, is assessed to be low,"" the ministry said. The family's six-month-old son and Indonesian domestic helper also caught the virus and are currently warded in isolation rooms. READ: 12 people from 5 families among confirmed coronavirus cases in Singapore As of noon on Thursday, 310 suspect cases have tested negative, with the test results of the remaining 147 cases pending, MOH added. Singapore confirmed its first case of the novel coronavirus on Jan 23, a 66-year-old Wuhan resident who arrived in Singapore from Guangzhou on Jan 20. To date, one of the 30 confirmed cases has been discharged. Singapore announced its first cluster of local transmission of the virus earlier this week.   Last Friday, it was announced that all new visitors with recent travel history to mainland China will not be allowed to enter Singapore. These visitors will also not be allowed to transit in Singapore. Those with Chinese passports, with the exception of Singapore permanent residents and long-term pass holders, will also not be allowed to enter Singapore. The novel coronavirus is believed to have started in Wuhan in China's Hubei province but has since spread to more than 20 countries around the world. It has killed more than 600 people and infected more than 28,000 globally. The World Health Organization has declared the virus outbreak a global emergency. Most deaths have been in Hubei province and officials have noted that the death rate, at about 2 per cent, is below the mortality rate of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

05 Feb 2020 11:03PM,'Fragile' Africa prepares for high risk of coronavirus spread,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners LONDON: An isolation ward stands ready at a hospital in Khartoum, Sudan. Laboratories in Senegal and Madagascar have the testing equipment they need. Passengers arriving at airports in Gambia, Cameroon and Guinea are being screened for fever and other viral symptoms. Africa's Centres for Disease Control and Prevention says it has activated its emergency operation centre in the face of what global health officials say is a high risk the coronavirus disease epidemic that began in China will spread to its borders. On a poor continent where healthcare capacity is limited, early detection of any outbreak will be crucial. The fear is great that a spreading epidemic of coronavirus infections will be hard to contain in countries where health systems are already overburdened with cases of Ebola, measles, malaria and other deadly infectious diseases. ""The key point is to limit transmission from affected countries and the second point is to ensure that we have the capacity to isolate and also to provide appropriate treatment to people that may be infected,"" said Michel Yao, emergency operations program manager at the World Health Organization's regional office for Africa in Brazzaville, Congo. The Democratic Republic of Congo is barring its citizens from flying to China. Burkina Faso has asked Chinese citizens to delay travelling to Burkina, and is warning that they face quarantine if they do. Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda have all suspended flights to China. ""What we are emphasising to all countries is that they should at least have early detection,"" Yao said. ""We know how fragile the health system is on the African continent and these systems are already overwhelmed by many ongoing disease outbreaks, so for us it is critical to detect earlier to that we can prevent the spread."" John Nkengasong, Africa's CDC director, told a briefing in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa this week that the activation of the emergency operation centre would create a single incident system to manage the outbreak across the continent. The Africa CDC will also hold a training workshop in Senegal for 15 African countries on laboratory diagnosis, he said. The continent has more than doubled the number of laboratories now equipped to diagnose the viral infection, this week adding facilities in Ghana, Madagascar and Nigeria and to established testing labs in South Africa and Sierra Leone. ""By the end of the week we expect that an additional 24 countries (in Africa) will receive the reagents needed to conduct the tests and will have the test running,"" a spokeswoman for the WHO's Africa Region told Reuters.

All the attendees at the Jan 20 to Jan 22 private business meeting were from one company, said MOH. Of the participants, 15 were Singapore residents and 94 were from overseas. Four of the 15 Singapore residents reported having symptoms and have been referred to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases for assessment, said MOH. The remaining 11 are well. All of the foreign participants have left Singapore, said MOH, adding that it has informed the relevant overseas health authorities. Malaysia announced on Tuesday that a 42-year-old Malaysian man who had been at the business meeting developed symptoms on Jan 29 and subsequently tested positive for the coronavirus on Feb 3. Malaysian authorities are tracking his close contacts. On Wednesday, South Korea reported that two of its citizens - a 38-year-old man and a 36-year-old man - who had attended the business meeting at the hotel had also been infected.   A spokesman for the Grand Hyatt Hotel confirmed on Wednesday that the Malaysian had stayed at the hotel for a week in mid-January. He added that the hotel has been deep cleaned and it is not aware of any other cases among its hotel guests or staff. The coronavirus have killed nearly 500 people and infected more than 24,000 in China. The disease is believed to have emerged in December in a Wuhan market that sold wild animals, and spread rapidly as people travelled for the Chinese New Year holiday in January.

08 Feb 2020 06:00PM,"PM Lee urges Singapore to take courage amid coronavirus outbreak, see through stressful time together","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Saturday (Feb 8) urged Singapore to ""take courage"" amid an ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak and ""see through this stressful time together"". The real test of the outbreak is to Singapore's social cohesion and psychological resilience, he said in a recorded message on the novel coronavirus situation in Singapore.  PM Lee highlighted the efforts of many Singaporeans stepping up during this period, including grassroots leaders and Team Nila volunteers helping to distribute masks to households, university students delivering food to schoolmates confined to their dorms on leave of absence, and healthcare workers treating patients.  PM Lee also lauded the efforts of business federations, unions, public transport workers, noting how they have gone the extra mile to maintain services, take care of workers, and keep Singapore running. ""They are inspirations to all of us. This is what it means to be Singaporean. This is who we are,"" he said. However, PM Lee said that the situation is still evolving, with each day bringing new developments, which Singapore has to respond to promptly and dynamically. ""NO NEED TO PANIC"" PM Lee noted that while most of the coronavirus cases in Singapore have either been imported, or linked to imported cases, there have been some that cannot be traced to the source of infection. ""These worried us, because it showed that the virus is probably already circulating in our own population,"" said Mr Lee.   As a result of the local transmissions, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Friday. DORSCON takes into account the current disease situation overseas, how transmissible the disease is, how likely it is to arrive in Singapore and what impact it may have on the local community. It was also raised to Orange during the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009.    ""So there is no need to panic. We are not locking down the city or confining everybody to stay at home. We have ample supplies, so there is no need to stock up with instant noodles, tinned food, or toilet paper, as some people did yesterday,"" he said. If the number of cases of infection continues to grow, however, Singapore will have to reconsider its strategy, said PM Lee, as it is ""futile to try to trace every contact"" if the virus is widespread. Hospitals would be overwhelmed if every suspect case is hospitalised and isolated, he said. At that point, provided the fatality rate is low, Singapore could shift its approach to encourage those with mild symptoms to see their family GP instead of going to the hospital. This way, he said, hospitals and healthcare workers would be able to focus on the most vulnerable patients instead.   However, Singapore is not at that point yet, said PM Lee. ""It may or may not happen, but we are thinking ahead and anticipating the next few steps,"" he said. ""And I am sharing these possibilities with you, so that we are all mentally prepared for what may come."" ""WE CAN EACH DO OUR PART"" Whatever the situation, we can each do our part, said PM Lee. People should observe personal hygiene, take their temperature twice daily, and if they are unwell, avoid crowded places and see a doctor immediately. ""These simple steps do not take much effort, but if we all do them, they will go a long way towards containing the spread of the virus,"" he said. PM Lee said that he is confident of the medical outcome of the outbreak, and that most Singaporeans should remain well. Those who fall ill should expect to recover, said PM Lee - among those who have been hospitalised so far, despite a few remaining in critical condition, most are stable or improving, with some having already been discharged after recovering.   ""Fear and anxiety are natural human reactions. We all want to protect ourselves and our families from what is still a new and unknown disease. But fear can do more harm than the virus itself,"" he said. ""It can make us panic, or do things which make matters worse, like circulating rumours online, hoarding facemasks or food, or blaming particular groups for the outbreak. ""We should take courage and see through this stressful time together."" PM Lee concluded by urging Singaporeans to stay united and resolute during the outbreak. ""Take sensible precautions, help one another, stay calm, and carry on with our lives,"" he said.

12 Feb 2020 09:00AM,Stocks inch higher as new coronavirus cases fall,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Asian shares and Wall Street futures nudged higher on Wednesday amid hopes the worst of the coronavirus in China may have passed, although prevailing uncertainty about the outbreak has kept investors wary. TOKYO: Asian shares and Wall Street futures nudged higher on Wednesday amid hopes the worst of the coronavirus in China may have passed, although prevailing uncertainty about the outbreak has kept investors wary. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.1per cent. Australian shares were up 0.27per cent, while Japan's Nikkei stock index rose 0.45per cent. Oil futures, which have been in a downtrend since the start of the year, rose in Asia from 13-month lows due to budding optimism about the virus and hopes that output cuts by major producers will support prices. The yuan held gains in offshore trade and safe-havens such as Treasuries, the yen and the Swiss franc were marginally weaker in a sign of slowly improving sentiment. The global mood brightened after China's senior medical adviser said on Tuesday the number of new coronavirus cases was falling in some provinces and forecast the epidemic would peak this month. The number of new cases in Hubei, the province at the epicenter of the outbreak, was 1,068 as of Tuesday, down from a peak of over 3,000 new cases on Feb. 4, and the lowest number of new infections since Jan. 31. Investors will likely need to see more evidence that the virus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has spread to 24 other countries and territories, is indeed receding before they take on more risk. Concerns that the virus will slow factory activity and consumer spending in the world's second-largest economy have roiled global stocks and commodities, and many of these markets are still trying to regain their footing. ""Evidence suggests the positive mood will continue, and we see some coordination in markets with oil rallying, base metals up and Treasuries coming under pressure,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney. ""It does appear there is increasing comfort that the virus won't impact growth in a significant way, but I am not ready to buy risk assets yet."" U.S. stock futures rose 0.12per cent in Asia on Wednesday. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq inched to their second consecutive closing high on Tuesday. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell further in Asia, pushing yields up to 1.6057per cent. Treasury prices declined on Tuesday after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. economy is resilient. Powell also said he is closely monitoring the coronavirus in China, because it could lead to disruptions that affect the global economy. Chinese firms and factories are struggling to get back to work after the extended Lunar New Year holiday. Some companies say they need loans and are laying off workers as supply chains for global firms from car manufacturers to smartphone makers ruptured. China's foremost medical adviser on the outbreak, Zhong Nanshan, told Reuters numbers of new cases were falling in some provinces and forecast the epidemic would peak this month, although investors remained skeptical. In the commodities market, U.S. crude futures ticked up 0.32per cent to US$50.10 a barrel on hopes that Chinese demand for oil will pick up once the flu-like virus is contained. Saudi Arabia wants global oil producers to agree a quick supply cut in response to the coronavirus, sources familiar with the kingdom's thinking have told Reuters, which is another supportive factor for crude futures. In the offshore market, the yuan was little changed at 6.9682 per dollar but close to a two-week high. The yen traded at 109.82 versus the greenback, on course for its third day of decline, while the Swiss franc held steady at 0.9755 against the dollar.

03 Feb 2020 11:45AM,"Novel coronavirus from Wuhan could transmit through human faeces, say scientists: Report","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners WUHAN: Scientists at China's top research body in natural sciences have found another possible mode of transmission of the novel coronavirus which originated in Wuhan. The virus, which has claimed the lives of more than 360 people in China, could be transmitted through the digestive system and into human faeces, according to scientists cited in a report by China's Xinhua news agency. This means that the virus could be ingested through the faecal-oral route, where pathogens can pass through faeces and into the mouth of another person. It may occur due to poor hygiene practices, lack of sanitation, pollution of soil and water bodies with faecal matter or contamination of food. Experts from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and the Wuhan Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences noticed that the initial symptom of some patients infected with the coronavirus was diarrhoea instead of fever, a more common symptom. The research team found viral nucleic acids in patients' stool and rectal swabs, and believes that the novel coronavirus has certain faecal-oral transmission possibilities, in addition to droplet and contact transmissions. China confirmed on Monday more than 17,000 cases of the coronavirus. The first coronavirus death outside China was reported on Sunday in the Philippines, a day after China imposed a lockdown on a major city far from the epicentre. Most of the infections overseas have been detected in people who travelled from Wuhan, an industrial hub of 11 million people, or surrounding areas of Hubei province. China has embarked on unprecedented efforts to contain the virus, which is believed to have come from a Wuhan animal market. Apart from China, human-to-human transmission has also been reported in South Korea, Japan, Germany and Thailand.

09 Feb 2020 12:50AM,Head of WHO-led coronavirus probe team leaving for China,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners GENEVA: The head of a World Health Organization-led international team investigating the coronavirus outbreak will leave for China on Monday or Tuesday, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Saturday (Feb 8). Tedros, asked whether the team would include experts from the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), told a press conference on Saturday: ""We hope so."" The death toll in mainland China rose to 723 on Saturday, the WHO said, looking likely to pass the 774 deaths recorded globally during the 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Across mainland China, the number of cases stood at 34,598. Dr. Mike Ryan, WHO's top emergency expert, said there had been a stabilisation in the number of new cases reported from Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus, over the past four days. ""That's good news, and may reflect the impact of the control measures put in place. But remember there are also lots of suspected cases still to be tested."" Ryan, speaking later to Reuters, said: ""The daily number of new cases has been stable over a four-day period. The same number each day, around."" He added, ""It's not a decline. That can just mean four days of relative calm before it accelerates."" China has struggled to contain the current virus despite having placed around 56 million people under effective lockdown in Hubei and its provincial capital, Wuhan. Other cities far from the epicentre have also taken measures to keep people indoors, limiting the number of individuals who can leave their home. Friday's death of a 34-year-old Wuhan doctor who was punished for raising the alarm about the virus in December sparked an outpouring of grief and anger over the government's handling of the crisis. The virus has spread to two dozen countries, prompting several governments to ban arrivals from China and urge their citizens to avoid travelling to the country. Some have recommended their citizens leave China. Major airlines have suspended flights to and from China. At least 61 people on board a cruise ship off Japan have tested positive for the new coronavirus, with thousands of passengers and crew facing a two-week quarantine. The contagion emerged in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan in December, later spreading to the rest of China and more than two dozen other countries, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a global emergency. The number of confirmed infections in China could still grow significantly, with the health commission saying that more than 26,000 other people were ""suspected"" of having contracted the virus.

03 Feb 2020 11:31AM,Chinese markets plunge US$420 billion as novel coronavirus death toll rises,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The death toll from a coronavirus epidemic in China rose to 361 and Chinese stock and commodity markets fell heavily on Monday (Feb 3) as investors retreated into safe-haven assets in the first trading session after an extended Chinese New Year break. Chinese stock and commodity markets wiped US$420 billion off China's stock market in their first session since Jan 23, when the outbreak of the newly identified virus had claimed only 17 lives in Wuhan city in Hubei province. By lunchtime, the benchmark Shanghai Composite index sat 8 per cent lower near an almost one-year trough, and was poised to post its worst day in more than four years. The yuan opened at its weakest level in 2020 and slid almost 1.2 per cent, past the symbolic 7-per-dollar level, as the falls soured the mood in markets throughout Asia. Shanghai-traded oil, iron ore, copper and soft commodities contracts all posted sharp drops, catching up with sliding global prices.   Investors were bracing for volatility when onshore trade in Chinese stocks, bonds, yuan and commodities resumed, following a steep global selldown on fears about the impact of the virus on the world's second-biggest economy. ""This will last for some time,"" said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING. ""It's uncertain whether factory workers, or how many of them, will return to their factories,"" she said. ""We haven't yet seen corporate earnings since the (spread of the) coronavirus. Restaurants and retailers may have very little sales."" More than 2,500 stocks fell by the daily limit of 10 per cent. The Shanghai Composite last sat at 2,734.7 and the onshore yuan at 7.0165 per dollar. Copper sank to its lowest in more than three years, falling by its daily limit of 7 per cent, while aluminium, zinc and lead shed more than 4 per cent and soybeans dropped 2 per cent. Bond prices, meanwhile, surged, with March futures contracts for 10-year bonds jumping 1.5 per cent. CLEAR MESSAGE Amid the selldown, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) injected 1.2 trillion yuan (US$173.81 billion) into money markets through reverse bond repurchase agreements. It also unexpectedly cut the interest rate on those short-term funding facilities by 10 basis points. China's securities regulator moved to limit short selling and urged mutual fund managers not to sell shares unless they face investor redemptions, sources told Reuters. ""It is a clear message that they want to take growth-supportive measures and keep the market reassured,"" said Mayank Mishra, macro strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore of the PBOC move. ""They are managing the situation well. The timing of the repo rate cut came a little quicker than some people were expecting, but they wanted to send a clear message."" Beijing has also said it would help firms that produce vital goods resume work as soon as possible, state broadcaster CCTV reported. Cities like Wuhan, where the virus originated, remain in virtual lockdown and China is facing mounting international isolation. Analysts are beginning to suspect the impact will be deeper than the hit delivered by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. ""Although most analysts agree it is too early to estimate the impact of (the virus) on the global economy, one thing I am increasingly more certain of is that the near-term shock to Chinese economy will be much higher than that in SARS period,"" said Tommy Xie, head of Greater China research at OCBC. ""The shock to Chinese manufacturing and industry sectors is likely to be unprecedented.""   Since then the flu-like virus has spread to more than two dozen other countries and regions, with the first death outside of China reported on Sunday, that of a 44-year-old Chinese man who died in the Philippines after travelling from Wuhan. The total number of deaths in China rose to 361 as of Sunday, up 57 from the previous day, the National Health Commission said. The number of new confirmed infections in China rose by 2,829, bringing the total to 17,205. While stock markets reopened, most provinces have extended the Chinese New Year holiday to try and contain the virus, with workers in Hubei not scheduled to return to work until after Feb 13.   At least another 171 cases have been reported in more than two dozen other countries and regions, including the United States, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong and Britain. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, but said global trade and travel restrictions are not needed. More than 250 people from 30 countries arrived in France on Sunday after being flown out of Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, in the latest evacuation of foreign nationals from the locked-down city. Australia evacuated 243 people, many children, from Wuhan on Monday and will quarantine them on a remote island in the Indian Ocean off its northwest coast.   Australia on Saturday followed the United States in barring entry to all foreign nationals travelling from mainland China. The Group of Seven leading industrialised democracies are trying to find a common approach for dealing with the fast-spreading new coronavirus, German Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Sunday. The virus is thought to have emerged late last year in a Wuhan market illegally trading wildlife. It can cause pneumonia and spreads between people in droplets from coughs and sneezes.   It has created alarm because it is spreading quickly and there are still important unknowns surrounding it, such as its death rate and whether it is able to spread before any symptoms show. The number of deaths in China from the new virus has now passed the total Chinese toll from the 2002-03 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus which emerged from China and killed more than 800 people around the world. Even so, Chinese data on the numbers of infections and deaths suggests the new coronavirus is less deadly than the SARS outbreak, although such numbers can evolve rapidly.

In its daily update, the health commission in Hubei also confirmed another 3,694 new cases.   The commission also confirmed the number of infections has reached 28,018 nationwide. The epidemic, which has spiralled into a global health emergency, is believed to have emerged in December from a market that sold wild game in Hubei's capital Wuhan. Hu Lishan, an official in Wuhan, warned Wednesday that despite building a hospital from scratch and converting public buildings to accommodate thousands of extra patients, there was still a ""severe"" lack of beds in the region.  There was also a shortage of ""equipment and materials,"" he told reporters, adding that officials were looking to convert other hotels and schools in the city into treatment centres. Authorities in several other cities in China have placed restrictions on the number of people allowed to leave their homes. Global concerns have also risen about the virus, with cases confirmed in more than 20 countries.

04 Feb 2020 06:30AM,Commentary: Novel coronavirus reveals old vulnerabilities in the global economy,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners The novel coronavirus has the potential to become a big enough shock that reveals the weaknesses of central banks and sluggish global growth, says Mohamed El-Erian. NEWPORT BEACH, California: Last week’s fretting over the coronavirus was a good illustration of a tug of war that has been playing out in financial markets for a while: Between favourable sentiment and mounting longer-term economic uncertainties. Until now, at least, that contest has been resolved in favour of ever-higher stock prices. But investors need to decide if they want to opt for more of the same, by continuing to implement an investment playbook that has served them well, or if they want to treat the viral outbreak for what it is — a big economic shock that could derail global growth and shake markets out of their “buy-the-dip” conditioning. Entering 2020, investors faced the challenge of balancing favourable short-term market technicals with weaker fundamentals, and doing so with government bonds providing little protection given the very low — and, in some cases, negative — level of yields in advanced countries. NOVEL VULNERABILITIES The coronavirus outbreak amplifies two vulnerabilities: Structurally weak global growth and less effective central banks. It is becoming harder for markets to treat such fragilities as being beyond the immediate horizon, especially with a host of other uncertainties not far behind, including the recurrence of trade tensions, growing realisation of the impact of climate change, technological shocks, political polarisation and changing demographics. Retail, trade and travel are simple ways to illustrate what is going on in China. Stores are facing dramatic disruptions involving a virtual halt in traffic, while suppliers are finding it harder and slower to move their merchandise, both within and in and out of the country. And there is a huge drop in travel to China, dealing another blow to economic activities undermined by less internal mobility. This virtual stoppage of economic activities is cascading throughout the second-largest economy in the world, and one with considerable regional and global ties. It is fundamentally weakening the country’s services sector, at a time of considerable challenges for manufacturing. CHINA SLOWDOWN With both engines of growth now sputtering, internal and external, China will also find it harder to navigate its transition from a middle-income economy. The country’s increasing “sudden stop” economic dynamics also involve adverse spill-over effects, first and foremost for emerging Asian economies with strong economic and financial linkages with China.   A weakening China is also a problem for Europe, where the European Central Bank is effectively out of productive ammunition and politicians are yet to implement a comprehensive pro-growth policy package. And with the virus affecting the movement of people and goods, there is an increased risk of a multi-year process of de-globalisation that neither the global economy nor markets are wired for. The coronavirus also has the potential to constitute a structural break for markets: A big enough shock that fundamentally shifts sentiment. NEW GAME PLAN Previously, markets had been underpinned by the belief that central banks were always willing and able to repress volatility and boost asset prices. That fuelled investors’ fear of missing out on a seemingly never-ending rally. Until last Friday (Jan 31) when US stocks dropped about 2 per cent, markets’ inclination was to respond to sell-offs by deploying a game plan that worked well in 2019 and early 2020, including in response to shocks such as the US missile attack that killed a top Iranian general and the disruption to half of Saudi Arabia’s oil production.   For the previous year, traders and investors quickly bought every dip in the belief that the latest shock would prove temporary, contained and reversible. Now, the multi-year gap between elevated asset prices and weaker economic conditions is becoming increasingly unsustainable. The global economy and markets are getting closer to the neck of a T-junction. What comes after that involves a stark contrast, depending on how policymakers respond. One way involves recession, financial instability and even more complicated politics; the other, a genuine growth process that validates elevated asset prices in an orderly fashion and opens the way for more constructive politics. If investors still insist on immediately buying dips, they should do so in a much more differentiated manner by favouring higher-quality issuers that are underpinned by strong balance sheets. They should also avoid swapping US assets for more international exposure, which — although more attractively valued — is much less resilient to global economic weakness. For the remainder, which is probably most investors, they should consider that this latest shock to fundamentals could prove severe enough to dislodge for a while the bullish market conditioning that has been so critical to this historic stock rally. Given that the negative economic effects of the virus are yet to be sufficiently absorbed by markets, this also calls for much greater immediate attention to potential vulnerabilities in portfolios, in the form of equity and liquidity risk.

05 Feb 2020 06:32AM,Commentary: Hot and humid weather may end the novel coronavirus – as well as the development of a vaccine,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Cases may fall sharply by May, when temperatures in China warm up, say Dr Jyoti Somani and Professor Paul Tambyah. SINGAPORE: The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that infected more people in China than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 has now spread across the globe. While we are learning more about the virus daily, questions are being raised about its rapid spread. One possibility is that this development could be related to climatic conditions. CLIMATE, WEATHER AND FLU SEASONALITY There is reason to believe that the seasonal pattern of novel coronavirus pneumonia may be similar to that of influenza infection and SARS, and thus cases may sharply fall by May, when temperatures in China warm up. In countries with temperate climates such as China and the United States, the flu season usually starts in December with a peak in January or February, after which cases decrease. SARS disappeared in the northern summer of 2003 and has not reappeared significantly since. This seasonality of influenza and other respiratory viruses in temperate countries is thought to be related to factors that affect infectiousness (person to person spread) such as the dryness of the air, ambient air temperature and possibly ultraviolet solar radiation. Human factors may also contribute to the spread of influenza during the colder winters since more time may be spent indoors, presumably in closer contact with other persons. The 2019-nCoV appears to be similar to other respiratory viruses such as influenza or the common cold (rhinovirus), which are spread by large droplets of saliva or phlegm from one person to another (either directly by cough or sneeze) or by contact. That happens when a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches his or her nose, mouth or eyes, inadvertently transmitting the virus. In fact, studies have shown that these respiratory droplets spread farther when the air is cold and dry. Studies done many years ago showed that the “regular” coronavirus (which is one of the causes of the common cold) can survive on surfaces 30 times longer in places with a temperature of 6 degrees Celsius compared to those where the temperature is 20 degrees Celsius and humidity levels are high. More recently, scientists from Hong Kong University (HKU) including Professor Malik Peiris and Professor Seto Wing Hong showed that low temperatures and low relative humidity allowed the SARS virus to survive much longer than they would in high temperatures and humidity.   The HKU team argued that this may be the reason warm and humid Southeast Asian countries did not have SARS outbreaks, unlike Hong Kong and Singapore where in their words, there is “intensive use of air-conditioning”. Thus, just as with influenza, the 2019-nCoV may slow down when the sun starts to shine more and the weather warms up in temperate and subtropical countries. LESSONS FROM SARS The SARS epidemic occurred 17 years ago and, since then, public health institutions, medical and laboratory science professionals, and the infectious diseases community are much better prepared to respond to novel and emerging infections globally. The improvements in communications and social media are undeniable. The genetic sequence of this new type of severe pneumonia in Wuhan was shared relatively early. This allowed countries all over the world to develop fast and accurate tests: These were not available during the initial weeks of SARS outbreak. Then, we had to depend on clinical examinations and contact tracing to determine who really was infected with SARS. Near the end of the epidemic, we were able to test everyone and we found out that we had actually missed a significant number of cases – these were only diagnosed after they had recovered. This has been the biggest difference in that now, low-resourced countries like Nepal and Cambodia are able to conduct relatively fast and accurate diagnosis on-site without having to wait for samples to be sent overseas. Given that the genetic information about the novel coronavirus was available even before countries had patients with the virus, many labs in advanced countries, including Singapore, are already working on blood tests for rapid detection and studying the immune response to help vaccine development. A trial to test anti-viral treatments has already been initiated in China and is being planned elsewhere. CONTACT TRACING AND TRAVEL BANS A basic public health approach to any outbreak is the use of contact tracing.   This means that for any patient who is found to be ill, close family members and other persons that he or she had close contact with during the incubation period will be notified that they were exposed to a sick person and quarantined for a further full incubation period, which for this novel infection is indicated to be 14 days. During the Ebola virus outbreak of 2014, this type of contact tracing was done very manually in many settings, although there were a number of mobile applications which were piloted. For this 2019 virus infection outbreak, much effort is being placed on high-tech contact tracing. It is too early to tell if this will be more effective, but any method to help contacts monitor themselves during the incubation period and detect symptoms may certainly help to decrease community transmission. Public health measures including screening and quarantining are similar to what was done for SARS and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), although there have been broader approaches to travellers without direct contact with infected patients because of the extent of community spread in China. Given that we are not sure as to what extent asymptomatic persons can transmit the virus, many countries have decided to close their borders to Chinese nationals, as they cannot rely on temperature screening to detect who is potentially contagious and necessitating quarantine. Many countries are also quarantining their own citizens and permanent residents returning from China, in an effort to limit introduction of this virus into the community. During SARS, the World Health Organization (WHO) imposed global travel restrictions and advisories. When a travel restriction is in effect, a country may feel the need to quickly get the ban lifted and reduce its aggressive screening and case finding. This may have contributed to the resurgence of SARS in Toronto after the initial period of good control. This time round, different countries have introduced their own travel restrictions which are probably more appropriate to the different situations and their relations with China. Travel bans are always controversial as they tend to have significant unintended consequences and have to be actually instituted before the virus appears in the country. Otherwise, they are relatively pointless. Among the concerns about the travel bans instituted this time during the coronavirus is the fact that we do not know how extensive the spread is from people without symptoms.   If this is really very widespread, then a blanket travel ban will have limited effects by now as the virus is probably silently spreading among and through most countries. Once there is documented local transmission in a country, as in Germany and the United States, the goal has to be containing the local transmission while at the same time preventing re-introduction of the virus. Overall, the key strategy has to be good contact tracing and widespread testing so that every case can be identified, tested and treated. That way the chain of transmission can be broken and the virus stopped in its tracks even before the warm weather kicks in. VACCINES AND DRUG TREATMENTS Unfortunately, the current way in which drug and vaccine development in modern medicine happens is very much driven by financial considerations. Unlike for example defence or homeland security, the question that always comes up when it comes to treating and preventing human disease is: “Is this financially viable?” As SARS disappeared 17 years ago and MERS has only occurred sporadically, primarily in the Middle East, there has been no incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to invest the funds needed to develop appropriate drugs and vaccines. All the interest and enthusiasm which came with SARS disappeared when the virus did not reappear after a couple of seasons. Governments had other priorities and most have actually left this part of national security to private industry. Hence, if and when the novel coronavirus disappears in May and does not reappear next October or November, we can predict that drug and vaccine development will likely die a natural death. That is unfortunately the way of the world and hopefully something can be done to change this. But that will require a massive global mindset change. Given the frequency with which these emerging viral infections occur, the world can ill- afford to continue along this road.

04 Feb 2020 09:09AM,"Japan testing 3,700 people quarantined on cruise ship after Hong Kong novel coronavirus case","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TOKYO: Japanese officials began screening more than 3,700 passengers and crew on a cruise ship quarantined off the port of Yokohama near Tokyo on Tuesday (Feb 4) after a Hong Kong man who sailed on the vessel last month tested positive for coronavirus. The 80-year-old man flew to Japan and boarded the ship, the Diamond Princess, run by Carnival Japan Inc, in Yokohama on Jan 20 and disembarked in Hong Kong on Jan 25, the company said. Japan was also preparing to expand the scope of its screening for the virus, and test criteria after initial tests failed to detect the virus in some people who were later found to be infected, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told reporters. Opposition parties and some experts have criticised the government for responding too slowly to the risks posed by the virus spreading in China and elsewhere. Chinese make up 30 per cent of all tourists travelling to Japan and nearly 40 per cent of the total amount foreign visitors spent last year, according to an industry survey. Japan has 20 confirmed coronavirus cases, of these 17 people have been in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the epidemic began. Japan on Saturday began refusing entry to foreigners who have been in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, in the past 14 days as well as people with passports issued in Hubei province. Suga said that as of Feb 3, eight foreigners had been barred from entering Japan. Some countries including the United States and Australia have denied entry to all foreign nationals travelling from China. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said he believed Japan's current restrictions on entry were appropriate, when asked at a news conference. Carnival Japan, a unit of British-American cruise operator Carnival Corp, confirmed that the turnaround of the ship had been delayed by about 24 hours for authorities to review the health of all 2,666 guests and 1,045 crew on board. Once everyone's health was checked, those with fevers or who felt unwell would be tested, after which authorities would decide whether to let people leave the ship, Suga said. Asked if the epidemic would affect a visit by Chinese leader Xi Jinping expected to take place in April, Suga said preparations for the visit were proceeding as planned.

07 Feb 2020 05:27PM,"Novel coronavirus: 3 new patients in Singapore with no China travel, link to existing cases","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: There are three new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in Singapore and none of them are linked to the existing cases or have been in China recently, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Friday (Feb 7). This brings the number of cases in the country to 33. There are now at least four patients with no recent travel history to China or links to the other cases.  A teacher was among the three new cases announced, while one of the cases went visiting during Chinese New Year after developing symptoms, said MOH. Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that authorities are now expanding their case definition and doing ""proactive case finding"". ""This means never mind a connection to China. When they have pneumonia, I want to know if this is novel coronavirus. We are investigating more cases, so we are discovering more cases,"" said Mr Gan. At a press briefing on Friday, Singapore authorities raised the DORSCON (Disease Outbreak Response System Condition) code to Orange from Yellow.  This means the disease is deemed severe and spreads easily from person to person, but has not spread widely and is being contained. Moderate disruption is expected, due to measures such as quarantine and visitor restrictions at hospitals.  Seventeen of the 33 confirmed patients in Singapore were visitors from China, while another four are Singaporeans who were evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30.   Twelve are locally transmitted, of which nine can be traced back to a group of Chinese tourists from Guangxi. Two patients are now in critical condition, said MOH. They are on breathing support and do not have any other significant medical problems, said MOH director of medical services Kenneth Mak.  Two patients have been discharged, while the remaining cases are stable or improving. The second discharged patient is a woman from Wuhan who was the second confirmed case in Singapore. Mr Mak said that experts around the world are working towards understanding the nature of the new coronavirus and its transmission patterns. ""All of us still recognise that the main form of spread remains by droplets and it is very important for us to recognise that most spread can occur through touch,"" he said.   This means touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the face, mouth or eyes with contaminated hands. He added that there have been some reports of spread from people who have yet to develop symptoms but that the evidence today shows the rate of transmission is ""very low"". THREE NEW CASES On Friday, MOH said that two of the new cases had been to Malaysia prior to their diagnosis. Case 31, a 53-year-old Singaporean man, had been in Malaysia on Jan 6, 11 and 17, said MOH. He reported having symptoms on Jan 23, and visited two clinics before being admitted to Changi General Hospital (CGH) on Feb 1. He is currently warded in an isolation room at CGH. He lives at Tampines Street 24 and had been to the Life Church and Missions Singapore in Paya Lebar. He had visited friends and family during Chinese New Year.   Case 33, a 39-year-old Singaporean woman, had also been in Malaysia from Jan 22 to 29. She is in isolation at Sengkang General Hospital (SKH). She reported having symptoms on Jan 30 and went to the emergency department on SKH on Feb 2 where she was admitted. JUNIOR COLLEGE TEACHER 32ND CASE The 32nd case, a 42-year-old Singaporean woman, reported symptoms on Sunday and was admitted to Parkway East Hospital on Wednesday. She works at Victoria Junior College but did not interact with colleagues or students after onset of symptoms as she was on medical leave.  The last day she was at school was Jan 31, said Ms Liew Wei Li, director of schools at the Ministry of Education (MOE). The teacher stays at Elias Road and had visited Changi Airport and the Singapore Zoo. She is currently warded in an isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). Tests for all three confirmed their 2019-nCOV infections at about 11pm on Thursday. Ms Liew added that a few colleagues and students who have been in close contact with the teacher will be given 14 days of leave of absence since last day of contact with her. The college will be thoroughly disinfecting the staff room, pantry and teaching rooms that the teacher was in and co-curricular activities will be suspended for 14 days, among other measures to prevent large-group gatherings.   UPDATE ON CASE 30 In an update on case 30, which was announced on Thursday, MOH said that the 27-year-old man reported having a fever on Jan 21 and visited a general practitioner clinic on Jan 28. The Singapore citizen, who had attended a conference in Singapore linked to a few other cases, went to another clinic for treatment on Feb 3 before being admitted to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases on Thursday. He lives at Shunfu Road and had been to Far East Square and Junction 8 shopping malls.   The business meeting at the Grand Hyatt was attended by more than 100 people, including participants from the Chinese province of Hubei. The new coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province at the end of last year has killed more than 630 people and spread around the world. The latest figures from China show there are more than 30,000 people infected in the country. A Chinese doctor who was punished after raising the alarm about the virus died from the pathogen on Friday, sparking an outpouring of grief and anger in China over the worsening crisis.

11 Feb 2020 07:31AM,"China coronavirus death toll passes 1,000","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The number of fatalities from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,016 nationwide on Tuesday (Feb 11) after 108 new deaths, including 103 in the hard-hit Hubei province. The other deaths were in the provinces of Heilongjiang, Anhui and Henan and the cities of Tianjin and Beijing, the National Health Commission said. The commission said there were another 2,478 new confirmed cases on the mainland on Monday, down from 3,062 on the previous day and bringing the accumulated total to 42,638. This includes the 2,097 new cases reported in Hubei province, where the outbreak emerged in December. The new virus is believed to have emerged last year in a market that sells wild animals in Hubei's capital Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak. Chinese President Xi Jinping met with medical workers and patients affected at a hospital in Beijing on Monday, where he called for ""more decisive measures"" to contain the outbreak, said state broadcaster CCTV. An advance team for a World Health Organization-led international expert mission on the virus arrived in China late Monday, headed by Bruce Aylward. He oversaw the organization's 2014-2016 response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. Ahead of the team's arrival, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned there had been some ""concerning instances"" of cases overseas in people with no travel history to China. Britain on Monday recorded a doubling of cases to eight, and the government warned the outbreak of novel coronavirus was a ""serious and imminent threat."" US President Donald Trump said he expected the outbreak would disappear in April due to hotter weather, a prognosis at odds with top US health officials.

31 Jan 2020 02:04PM,"Singapore has 'done well' in handling Wuhan coronavirus situation, but must remain vigilant: PM Lee","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore has done well so far in handling the Wuhan coronavirus situation, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said during a visit to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Friday (Jan 31). Several of the 13 confirmed Wuhan coronavirus cases in Singapore are currently warded in isolation rooms at the centre. Mr Lee said the country was able to quickly catch cases of the virus, as well as isolate and treat them, adding that doctors have told him the patients are faring well. ""But we have to continue to be vigilant, because the outbreak is far from over. In fact, it may still be accelerating in China,"" said Mr Lee. ""We have to continue to be on guard,"" he said, adding the Government and healthcare workers were prepared. Continuing on this path would help ensure community spread of the virus is not a problem here, he said. ""There's every reason to be watchful, but there's also every reason to be confident,"" said Mr Lee.   The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday declared the virus outbreak a ""global emergency"", with more than 9,800 confirmed cases and more than 200 deaths in China alone. The WHO's assessment ""confirmed Singapore's view of the situation"", he said, adding the team of ministers tasked with handling the situation is evaluating what to do next. On Thursday, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong announced that the Government would issue four masks to each household here. This came amid reports of many retailers islandwide running out of the items, over widespread concerns of the Wuhan coronavirus.  He also said there should not be discrimination against Chinese nationals, noting the virus can infect people of any race. ""They (China) are trying very hard to fight it, and I think we should work with them to help make sure this is not a global problem,"" he said.   One key difference from the SARS crisis is that social media is allowing rumours to spread more quickly, said Mr Lee, adding he was ""very glad"" the authorities had the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) to address the spread of untruths. Some of these rumours are ""malicious and deliberate"", he said, made up by people whose aim was to deliberately foment fear, uncertainty and doubt. These have been promptly addressed by POFMA, he said, adding that the Government is putting out accurate information as quickly as it can be verified.  Mr Lee also thanked healthcare workers on the frontlines, in places such as the NCID, adding he had a lot of respect for the difficult job they had to do.

05 Feb 2020 06:35AM,Indonesian health ministry says lab has all needed equipment to detect novel coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners JAKARTA: The Indonesian Health Ministry said it has all the required resources to test patients for the novel coronavirus. This came after media reports suggesting that Indonesia, which has no cases detected so far, lacks testing kits to rapidly detect any infections. The Health Ministry’s chief of biomedical research centre, Dr Vivi Setiawaty said Indonesia has followed guidelines set by the World Health Organization (WHO) since late December, when the new coronavirus strain was detected. “Ever since the outbreak occurred, the WHO has issued guidelines on how to detect the virus. The WHO issued a checklist and … (WHO) indicated that Indonesia is deemed capable of detecting the coronavirus,” she said during a Monday (Feb 3) press conference. “We have all the equipment needed.” Dr Setiawaty said the WHO checklist includes the acquisition of particular reagents - a substance or compound used in chemical analysis - which will react to coronavirus. “We have run through the checklist of what reagents we need so we can run the tests. Indonesia has acquired such reagents and we can run the tests according to the recommendations issued by WHO,” the doctor added. Dr Setiawaty said the ministry’s laboratory is currently capable of testing up to 1,200 samples. She also said that the facility and all the workers performing the tests have received WHO certification. “The lab has been accredited for emerging and re-emerging diseases, such as the novel coronavirus,” she said. To minimise errors, Dr Setiawaty noted that patients are tested multiple times and results are known in two days.   She said 38 people have been tested so far in Indonesia and all tested negative. More than 20,000 people have been infected by the virus, believed to have emerged in December from a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan. More than 400 people have died from the outbreak. WHO has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency as the virus spread to more than 20 countries including those as far away as Finland, France, the United States and the United Kingdom. But Indonesia, a country of 264 million people, appeared to have been spared from the outbreak, even as neighbouring countries like Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Australia have confirmed cases of the coronavirus. There are concerns on the ground over whether there may be loopholes in the Indonesian system, in terms of pandemic preparedness and virus testing. “We hope that Indonesia continues to be free from the outbreak,” Dr Windra Waworuntu, the Indonesian Health Ministry’s director for communicable diseases told reporters at the same press conference, adding that Indonesia is ready should an outbreak occur in the country.   “We have been communicating with other institutions. We are working with hospitals. We have checked the readiness of all health workers in the country. We continuously monitor the spread of the virus. We continuously monitor the number of confirmed cases and deaths around the world,” she said. “There are international laws which we have to adhere to. We are following WHO guidelines.” VIRUS DETECTION PROCESS CAN TAKE AT LEAST TWO DAYS Testing for the novel coronavirus is a tedious process. Professor Raden Wasito, a pathologist from Yogyakarta’s Gadjah Mada University who has been studying a wide variety of coronaviruses since 1988, said the suspected virus will normally be introduced to a corresponding antibody and see if the two react. For instance, if the virus is suspected to be Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), then it will be introduced to SARS antibody. “The problem is we don’t have an antibody for Wuhan coronavirus. No country has it. It hasn’t been discovered,” Prof Wasito said. This means that scientists around the world rely on the use of reagents and genetic sequencing to identify the novel coronavirus, a process which can take at least two days. To do that, the DNA or RNA sample of the virus will first have to be amplified so there is a large enough amount to study, said Professor Amin Soebandrio, a microbiologist with the Eijkman Institute, one of only two facilities certified to detect emerging viruses in Indonesia. Once millions of DNA or RNA copies are produced, they are introduced to a particular set of reagents to see if it causes a reaction, he told CNA. This step will determine whether a virus comes from the coronavirus family, which includes SARS, MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and viruses which only infect animals. “There are more than 200 types of coronaviruses. If it comes out positive for coronavirus, we then need to know which type. “And that is where the confirmation stage comes in, by looking at the genetic sequence of the virus and comparing it with the references provided by WHO,” Prof Soebandrio said. He added that Indonesia uses the same method as the rest of the world. METHODS NOT FOOLPROOF Nonetheless, Prof Wasito warned that the method currently employed is not without its flaws. A virus needs a host to survive, and in a process which requires a virus sample to spend days inside a lab, there is a chance of its RNA falling apart. “If the virus is dead or if its tissue is broken, the virus will produce an enzyme called RNase which destroys the RNA,” he said. “When a virus with a damaged RNA is tested, a false positive is possible and conversely it could also lead to a false negative.”   Dr Setiawaty of the Health Ministry’s biomedical research centre said to prevent a false outcome, patients have to be tested multiple times. “We collect samples from every patient at least twice, a day apart,” she said, adding that more tests will be conducted if the outcomes of both tests are inconsistent. Dr Setiawaty said her laboratory is taking all the precautions needed to accurately test patients. “We make sure that the samples don’t get contaminated. We have been working very meticulously to ensure the accuracy of our tests.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

04 Feb 2020 02:44PM,Malaysia confirms first citizen case of novel coronavirus; man was in Singapore for meeting attended by Chinese delegates,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia on Tuesday (Feb 4) confirmed the country's first citizen case of the novel coronavirus, bringing the total number of infected patients in the country to 10. Malaysian Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad said the man from Selangor is in stable condition and receiving treatment at Sungai Buloh Hospital. Singapore’s Ministry of Health (MOH) on Tuesday said the Malaysian national was in Singapore from Jan 16 to Jan 23 for a business meeting at the Grand Hyatt Hotel that involved Chinese nationals. After his return to Malaysia, the 42-year-old man developed symptoms and subsequently tested positive for the novel coronavirus on Feb 3. MOH said it has initiated epidemiological investigations and contact tracing to identify the individuals who had close contact with the cases. The man started showing symptoms on Jan 29, nearly a week after he returned to Malaysia, according to Malaysian authorities. The man's immediate family will also be put under ""home surveillance"" for 14 days, Dr Dzulkefly added. Speaking to reporters at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, MOH's director of medical services Kenneth Mak said Singapore was in touch with authorities in Malaysia. “We have got excellent relations with the Malaysian health authorities, we have been cooperating bilaterally,” Associate Professor Mak said. He added: “We understand that the particular risk exposure was quite some time ago … There is a possibility that many of the people that took part in this particular meeting may (not be) in Singapore anymore.” The other confirmed case on Tuesday in Malaysia was a 63-year-old man from Wuhan, who entered Malaysia via Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Jan 18. He is now in stable condition and being treated at the Kuala Lumpur Hospital. Another 20 suspected cases are currently awaiting further test results, Dr Dzulkefly added. Malaysia previously reported a total of eight coronavirus cases as of Jan 30, all of whom were Chinese nationals. The country's first three cases of the infection are relatives of a 66-year-old man who was confirmed by Singaporean health authorities to have tested positive for the virus. The three Chinese nationals had been quarantined in a hotel in Johor Bahru before they were admitted to Sungai Buloh Hospital in Kuala Lumpur.

05 Feb 2020 06:32AM,Commentary: Hot and humid weather may end the novel coronavirus – as well as the development of a vaccine,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Cases may fall sharply by May, when temperatures in China warm up, say Dr Jyoti Somani and Professor Paul Tambyah. SINGAPORE: The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that infected more people in China than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 has now spread across the globe. While we are learning more about the virus daily, questions are being raised about its rapid spread. One possibility is that this development could be related to climatic conditions. CLIMATE, WEATHER AND FLU SEASONALITY There is reason to believe that the seasonal pattern of novel coronavirus pneumonia may be similar to that of influenza infection and SARS, and thus cases may sharply fall by May, when temperatures in China warm up. In countries with temperate climates such as China and the United States, the flu season usually starts in December with a peak in January or February, after which cases decrease. SARS disappeared in the northern summer of 2003 and has not reappeared significantly since. This seasonality of influenza and other respiratory viruses in temperate countries is thought to be related to factors that affect infectiousness (person to person spread) such as the dryness of the air, ambient air temperature and possibly ultraviolet solar radiation. Human factors may also contribute to the spread of influenza during the colder winters since more time may be spent indoors, presumably in closer contact with other persons. The 2019-nCoV appears to be similar to other respiratory viruses such as influenza or the common cold (rhinovirus), which are spread by large droplets of saliva or phlegm from one person to another (either directly by cough or sneeze) or by contact. That happens when a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches his or her nose, mouth or eyes, inadvertently transmitting the virus. In fact, studies have shown that these respiratory droplets spread farther when the air is cold and dry. Studies done many years ago showed that the “regular” coronavirus (which is one of the causes of the common cold) can survive on surfaces 30 times longer in places with a temperature of 6 degrees Celsius compared to those where the temperature is 20 degrees Celsius and humidity levels are high. More recently, scientists from Hong Kong University (HKU) including Professor Malik Peiris and Professor Seto Wing Hong showed that low temperatures and low relative humidity allowed the SARS virus to survive much longer than they would in high temperatures and humidity.   The HKU team argued that this may be the reason warm and humid Southeast Asian countries did not have SARS outbreaks, unlike Hong Kong and Singapore where in their words, there is “intensive use of air-conditioning”. Thus, just as with influenza, the 2019-nCoV may slow down when the sun starts to shine more and the weather warms up in temperate and subtropical countries. LESSONS FROM SARS The SARS epidemic occurred 17 years ago and, since then, public health institutions, medical and laboratory science professionals, and the infectious diseases community are much better prepared to respond to novel and emerging infections globally. The improvements in communications and social media are undeniable. The genetic sequence of this new type of severe pneumonia in Wuhan was shared relatively early. This allowed countries all over the world to develop fast and accurate tests: These were not available during the initial weeks of SARS outbreak. Then, we had to depend on clinical examinations and contact tracing to determine who really was infected with SARS. Near the end of the epidemic, we were able to test everyone and we found out that we had actually missed a significant number of cases – these were only diagnosed after they had recovered. This has been the biggest difference in that now, low-resourced countries like Nepal and Cambodia are able to conduct relatively fast and accurate diagnosis on-site without having to wait for samples to be sent overseas. Given that the genetic information about the novel coronavirus was available even before countries had patients with the virus, many labs in advanced countries, including Singapore, are already working on blood tests for rapid detection and studying the immune response to help vaccine development. A trial to test anti-viral treatments has already been initiated in China and is being planned elsewhere. CONTACT TRACING AND TRAVEL BANS A basic public health approach to any outbreak is the use of contact tracing.   This means that for any patient who is found to be ill, close family members and other persons that he or she had close contact with during the incubation period will be notified that they were exposed to a sick person and quarantined for a further full incubation period, which for this novel infection is indicated to be 14 days. During the Ebola virus outbreak of 2014, this type of contact tracing was done very manually in many settings, although there were a number of mobile applications which were piloted. For this 2019 virus infection outbreak, much effort is being placed on high-tech contact tracing. It is too early to tell if this will be more effective, but any method to help contacts monitor themselves during the incubation period and detect symptoms may certainly help to decrease community transmission. Public health measures including screening and quarantining are similar to what was done for SARS and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), although there have been broader approaches to travellers without direct contact with infected patients because of the extent of community spread in China. Given that we are not sure as to what extent asymptomatic persons can transmit the virus, many countries have decided to close their borders to Chinese nationals, as they cannot rely on temperature screening to detect who is potentially contagious and necessitating quarantine. Many countries are also quarantining their own citizens and permanent residents returning from China, in an effort to limit introduction of this virus into the community. During SARS, the World Health Organization (WHO) imposed global travel restrictions and advisories. When a travel restriction is in effect, a country may feel the need to quickly get the ban lifted and reduce its aggressive screening and case finding. This may have contributed to the resurgence of SARS in Toronto after the initial period of good control. This time round, different countries have introduced their own travel restrictions which are probably more appropriate to the different situations and their relations with China. Travel bans are always controversial as they tend to have significant unintended consequences and have to be actually instituted before the virus appears in the country. Otherwise, they are relatively pointless. Among the concerns about the travel bans instituted this time during the coronavirus is the fact that we do not know how extensive the spread is from people without symptoms.   If this is really very widespread, then a blanket travel ban will have limited effects by now as the virus is probably silently spreading among and through most countries. Once there is documented local transmission in a country, as in Germany and the United States, the goal has to be containing the local transmission while at the same time preventing re-introduction of the virus. Overall, the key strategy has to be good contact tracing and widespread testing so that every case can be identified, tested and treated. That way the chain of transmission can be broken and the virus stopped in its tracks even before the warm weather kicks in. VACCINES AND DRUG TREATMENTS Unfortunately, the current way in which drug and vaccine development in modern medicine happens is very much driven by financial considerations. Unlike for example defence or homeland security, the question that always comes up when it comes to treating and preventing human disease is: “Is this financially viable?” As SARS disappeared 17 years ago and MERS has only occurred sporadically, primarily in the Middle East, there has been no incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to invest the funds needed to develop appropriate drugs and vaccines. All the interest and enthusiasm which came with SARS disappeared when the virus did not reappear after a couple of seasons. Governments had other priorities and most have actually left this part of national security to private industry. Hence, if and when the novel coronavirus disappears in May and does not reappear next October or November, we can predict that drug and vaccine development will likely die a natural death. That is unfortunately the way of the world and hopefully something can be done to change this. But that will require a massive global mindset change. Given the frequency with which these emerging viral infections occur, the world can ill- afford to continue along this road.

09 Feb 2020 10:41PM,6 new coronavirus cases found on Japan cruise ship,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TOKYO: Six more people on a cruise ship off Japan are found to have the new coronavirus, the government said Sunday (Feb 9), bringing the number who have tested positive on board to 70. Test results are still coming in as passengers on the Diamond Princess face a two-week quarantine against the the virus, which has killed hundreds of people, most of them in China. Japanese authorities had earlier tested 279 people on board the cruise ship, finding 64 of them were infected with the coronavirus. Aside from infections on board the ship, Japan has reported 26 cases. The Diamond Princess was quarantined after a former passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong last month was diagnosed with the virus. There were more than 3,700 passengers and crew on the ship when it arrived off Japan's coast last week. Dozens have been taken to hospital and around 3,600 people, many of them elderly, were still on board on Sunday. It was not clear whether Japanese authorities would conduct tests on all of them. The ship docked in Yokohama on Sunday to resupply for a quarantine that could last until Feb 19. Local reports said Japan's health authorities brought urgently needed drugs and other medical supplies to about 500 people. About 100 said they had a fever or felt unwell, according to the reports. Passengers on the ship have been asked to stay inside their cabins to prevent new infections with some expressing confusion and frustration. Television footage has shown a Japanese flag hung on a balcony with the message: ""Drug shortage is serious.""

03 Feb 2020 06:21AM,Commentary: Tourism in Asia takes a beating after Wuhan coronavirus outbreak,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners The timing could not be worse. The coronavirus outbreak occurring during the Chinese Lunar New Year, one of the biggest travel seasons in Asia, says Lisa Wan. HONG KONG: The novel coronavirus outbreak has killed hundreds and infected more than 14,000 in China within the last two months. At least 15 cities in China are locked down, accounting for a population of over 50 million people. Given the virus continues to spread worldwide, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on Friday (Jan 31). More countries, including the US, UK, and Canada, have warned against nonessential travel to China as well as established travel restrictions to tourists Among many, Singapore has also blocked the entry of tourists who had visited Hubei province in the past 14 days, or who hold passports issued in the province, and just these past few days, widened these restrictions to all visitors with recent travel history to China. Malaysia has also stopped issuing visas to Chinese travellers from Hubei. KEY TOURISM MARKETS AFFECTED The tourism industry – which include hotels, airlines, casinos and restaurants - is expected to suffer massively during the outbreak. For example, officials in Thailand estimate potential lost revenue at 50 billion baht (US$1.6 billion) around Lunar New Year this year.   The timing could not be worse. The coronavirus outbreak occurring during the Chinese Lunar New Year, one of the biggest travel seasons in Asia, when hundreds of millions of Chinese return to homes or take holidays, both domestically and internationally. The tourism industries in China and key countries that rely on Chinese tourists will suffer the most immediate repercussions. According to the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute, 6.3 million Chinese tourists travel abroad during the 2019 Lunar New Year holiday, generating travel revenue of around 513.9 billion yuan (US$73 billion). Before the outbreak, the Institute predicted 7 million Chinese tourists would travel abroad during the Lunar New Year this year. Hong Kong, Thailand and Japan are top favourite travel destinations. Chinese visitors make up the largest source market of Hong Kong, accounting for around 78 per cent (around 44 million) of the total number of visitor arrivals in Hong Kong for the entire 2019 (of 56 million). On the one hand, Hong Kong’s appeal to Chinese tourists has already been weakened by months of political protests, with inbound tourism already down 56 per cent from a year earlier. But with the coronavirus outbreak, Hong Kong has now suspended flights and train services to Wuhan and cancelled all Lunar New Year celebrations. The Hong Kong Marathon, originally scheduled for early February, had also been called off. Hong Kong airlines are cutting the number of their flights to the mainland by about half through the end of March in response to government virus-control efforts. All these additional virus-control policies will hit the Hong Kong tourism industry harder. The number of Chinese visitors to Japan has also exploded from around 450,000 in 2003 to 8.4 million in 2018, accounting for 27 per cent of all inbound tourists. Chinese tourists are also big spenders in many other cities, like London, Paris and New York. For example, China remains the fifth-largest source of foreign tourism to the US, behind Canada, Mexico, the UK and Japan. Around 3 million Chinese tourists also travelled to the US in 2018, spending more than US$36 billion.   The novel coronavirus has now infected more people in China than the SARS outbreak in 2003. The number of confirmed cases has jumped to more than 14,000, surpassing the 5,329 in China from SARS. According to the International Monetary Fund, China accounted for 4.3 per cent of world economic output in 2003, and this number jumped to 16.3 per cent last year. In other words, the novel coronavirus will affect the world economy more significantly when compared to the SARS outbreak. PRUDENT STRATEGY TO SCREEN ALL TRAVELLERS MORE THOROUGHLY That the novel coronavirus happened during the midst of the Chinese Lunar New Year period shows why tourism is one way in which the virus spread rather quickly. Aside from the imposition of travel restrictions on travellers from Hubei or China more largely, countries must screen all travellers from other countries just as thoroughly. The new coronavirus is able to transfer from one person to another, so crowded tourist attractions and closed spaces in planes definitely will speed up its spread. All but one reported death from the outbreak have so far occurred in China, but travellers have spread the virus to numerous other places. Cases have been confirmed in numerous countries including Australia, Cambodia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, the UK, the US and Vietnam.   One typical example is the first case of virus in Japan. The infected Japanese driver drove tour buses for Chinese groups from Wuhan in January, ferrying them from Osaka to Tokyo and back. He is believed to be the first case of the virus in Japan not linked to recent travel to China but was likely to have contracted the infection through while in confined spaces in the tour bus. A scientific paper published on Jan 14 in the Journal of Travel Medicine examined the potential for the international spread of the Wuhan coronavirus via commercial air travel. It identified the top 20 destination cities with regard to passengers arriving from Wuhan, using International Air Transport Association data from January to March 2018. Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei welcomed the most arrivals at 41,080, 23,707, 20,001, and 17,645 respectively. All have identified cases of the coronavirus, although several of Hong Kong’s cases are known to have entered the city via the high-speed railway rather than on a plane.

11 Feb 2020 07:24PM,Malaysian Health Minister announces joint working committee with Singapore to tackle novel coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners KUALA LUMPUR: The health ministries of Malaysia and Singapore will form a joint working committee headed by the respective deputy ministers to manage the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. Malaysian Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad said in a press conference on Tuesday (Feb 11) that the decision to set up the committee was made during a conference call involving senior officials from both countries. The committee aims to consolidate various cross-border efforts, he said. The two-way cooperation will focus on sharing information on public health, medicine and research to ensure that the outbreak is handled efficiently. Singapore's Ministry of Health (MOH) in a press release on Tuesday said that senior health officials from both countries will work closely together over the next few days to determine the composition and terms of reference of this joint-workgroup. ""Singapore has nominated Senior Minister of State for Transport and Health Dr Lam Pin Min to co-chair the joint working group,"" MOH added. CROSS-BORDER SCREENING Malaysia and Singapore will also scrutinise cross-border case screening and management, Dr Dzulkefly said. In addition, both sides will coordinate on the use of antiviral drugs for patients who have been tested positive, he said. He explained that the first meeting would be held once both deputy ministers find a mutually acceptable time. When asked why Malaysia had decided to embark on such a bilateral initiative at this juncture, he said the committee was important as both countries are close to one another.   ""We have got a historical relationship, we have got a good bilateral relationship ... We share the same causeway, there are hundreds of people travelling across each day for reasons of family, business and leisure, so all the more why we should strengthen and enhance our cooperation managing this coronavirus outbreak,"" he said. MOH said on Tuesday that since the start of the outbreak, both countries have been in close touch with one another, including ""expeditiously sharing information on cross-border cases"". ""The cooperation would not have been possible without the strong collaboration and network built up over the years,"" MOH added. On Tuesday, the minister said there were no new confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Malaysia, which means the total number of cases remained at 18. Of the total, 12 are Chinese nationals and six are Malaysian citizens. At least seven cases in Malaysia are said to have travelled to Singapore. Three patients, all of whom are Chinese nationals, have been discharged. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Copyright© Mediacorp 2020. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

06 Feb 2020 08:15PM,Indonesia says no need to test citizens evacuated from Wuhan for novel coronavirus as they are healthy,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners JAKARTA: A senior Indonesian health official said there is no need to conduct novel coronavirus tests on citizens quarantined after being evacuated from Wuhan, as all 243 people were healthy. Speaking at a press conference on Thursday (Feb 6), Dr Windra Waworuntu, the Health Ministry’s director for communicable diseases said: “We don’t take swab samples because they are well. The SOP (standard operating procedure) doesn’t say that we have to take samples from everyone."" “If they are not well, feverish, coughing and sneezing, then we will swab (them for samples). If they are fine, why should we swab?”   On Sunday, Indonesia evacuated 238 students from Hubei province, where the novel coronavirus is thought to have originated amid a lockdown by Chinese authorities. All 238 students and five officials from the Indonesian embassy in China who assisted the students’ return, were subsequently quarantined at a military facility in the remote Indonesian island of Natuna for the next two weeks. COST IS AN ISSUE: HEALTH MINISTRY Dr Waworuntu said that it would be costly to test all those currently under quarantine. The reagent - a compound used in chemical analysis to detect coronavirus - involved for one test would cost a billion rupiah (US$73,035), she claimed. Each person is tested at least twice to ensure accuracy. “But that doesn’t mean we won’t do it when we have to. We will.” When asked if the current approach is in line with guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Waworuntu said Indonesia is complying with all guidelines and recommendations currently set by the international body. The director said Indonesia will only tighten the current policy if it is mandated by the WHO. “The guidelines set by the WHO is constantly updated. Perhaps tomorrow will be different,” she said. “But from the guidelines we have received so far, that is the standard.”   Dr Waworuntu said doctors are constantly monitoring the health of everyone being quarantined in Natuna. To date, the virus has killed more than 550 people and infected over 28,000 people around the world. The WHO has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency as the virus spread to at least 25 countries and regions. But Indonesia, a country of 264 million people, appeared to be spared from the outbreak, even as neighbouring countries like Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Australia each has confirmed cases of novel coronavirus. Indonesia has earlier tested 42 people for the novel coronavirus since the outbreak began last month. But all tests came back negative. Some have questioned if Indonesia has the right tools to detect the virus. ""EVERYTHING IN LINE WITH WHO PROTOCOL"" Dr Waworuntu said Indonesia would continue to make preparations for a possible outbreak. “Indonesia is doing everything in line with (WHO) protocol. We are making preparations and continue to increase our capacity,” she said.   Indonesia has readied 100 hospitals across the country to isolate and treat suspected novel coronavirus patients but Dr Waworuntu said the government plans to have more. “We are checking the readiness of hospitals, outside of the 100 so each province has at least one,” she said. Indonesia has 34 provinces. The Health Ministry director said her office is also improving laboratories across the country so they are able to conduct test and diagnosis for the novel coronavirus. Currently, all samples are being tested at the ministry’s biomedical research centre in Jakarta. “We want laboratories outside of Jakarta to be able to conduct tests and diagnosis. So not only at our research centre, but labs in Jakarta, Surabaya, Manado, Papua, Makassar and Sumatra,” she said, adding that it would save time and minimise the chances of the samples being contaminated or damaged along the way.

14 Feb 2020 08:20AM,"China reports 121 new coronavirus deaths, more than 5,000 new cases","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The death toll from a coronavirus outbreak rose by 121 in mainland China, the national health commission said on Friday (Feb 14). The majority of the deaths came from the central province of Hubei and its capital Wuhan, where the flu-like virus named COVID-19 is believed to have originated late last year. Hubei's health commission said there were 116 new deaths in the province, including 88 in Wuhan. A further 5,090 cases had been detected, including 4,823 in Hubei. More than four-fifths of the province's new cases were in Wuhan. The accumulative death toll was, however, revised downwards from 1,488 to 1,380, after officials said some fatalities had been counted more than once. The National Health Commission removed 108 deaths after discovering ""duplicate statistics"" in Hubei, according to its daily update, without providing more details.  The commission also subtracted 1,043 from the total number of confirmed infections in Hubei after a ""verification"". The total number of cases now stands at 63,851. The extent of the epidemic seemed to deepen on Thursday after authorities in Hubei started counting patients who were diagnosed through lung imaging, in addition to those who undergo lab tests. The revision added nearly 15,000 patients to Hubei's count in a single day, with officials explaining that past cases were included. The World Health Organization has moved to calm fears, saying the new numbers did ""not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the outbreak"". But Adam Kamradt-Scott, an infectious diseases expert at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney, said the new figures give no indication the outbreak is nearing a peak. ""Based on the current trend in confirmed cases, this appears to be a clear indication that while the Chinese authorities are doing their best to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the fairly drastic measures they have implemented to date would appear to have been too little, too late,"" he said. BACKLASH AGAINST BUREAUCRATS The epidemic has given China's ruling Communist Party one of its sternest challenges in years, constrained the world's second-largest economy and triggered a purge of provincial bureaucrats. Provincial Communist Party boss Jiang Chaoliang was fired as secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee, and Ma Guoqiang removed as party chief in Wuhan, state media said. They were the two highest-profile officials to be axed since the outbreak. Economists are assessing the impact of the outbreak on the world's second-largest economy and scaling back their expectations for growth this year. China's economy will grow at its slowest rate since the global financial crisis in the current quarter, according to a Reuters poll of economists who said the downturn will be short-lived if the outbreak is contained.

Malaysia's Ministry of Health said the woman had direct contact with her son-in-law when they sat at the same table during Chinese New Year celebrations on Jan 26, Jan 27 and Jan 28. The woman stayed home between Jan 29 and Feb 4, the ministry added in its press release. Malaysia on Sunday also expanded a ban on visitors from China to include Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces, after China's decision to lock down cities in the provinces to curb the spread of the coronavirus outbreak that has claimed over 800 lives. The Southeast Asian nation on Jan 27 imposed a temporary ban on travellers arriving from the city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, and the surrounding province of Hubei. Deputy Prime Minister Wan Azizah Wan Ismail said the decision follows China's move to extend its lockdown to five cities in Zhejiang and two in Jiangsu. China's Hubei province, where Wuhan is the capital, has been on lockdown since Jan 23. ""Travel restrictions will be enforced in accordance with the lock-down region imposed by the Chinese Government,"" Wan Azizah said in a statement on Sunday. The restriction will be imposed on all tourists regardless of nationality who have visited Hubei, Zhejiang and Jiangsu, she added.

One had worked at the same location as another Bangladeshi coronavirus patient, the other is a Singapore permanent resident (PR) who lives in Johor Bahru and works at Resorts World Sentosa Casino. This brings the number of cases in Singapore to 47, with seven in critical condition. Two more patients - cases 17 and 36 - were discharged from hospital on Tuesday, meaning nine have now fully recovered from the virus. Case 17 was a 47-year-old Singaporean woman who was among the Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30. Case 36 was a 38-year-old Singapore permanent resident who had attended a business meeting at Grand Hyatt Singapore, that has been linked to several cases overseas. A total of 25 cases in Singapore are local transmissions.   Case 46 Case 46 is a 35-year-old male Singapore PR who lives in Johor Bahru and works at Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) Casino. He does not have any recent travel history to China. He reported having symptoms on Feb 5 and sought treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 9. He was taken by ambulance to Tan Tock Seng Hospital on the same day and isolated. Test results confirmed he had the infection the next day on Feb 10. Prior to admission, he had gone to work at the casino. He is currently isolated at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). Responding to queries from CNA, RWS said that it has identified an unspecified number of employees who had recent contact with the employee and instructed them to go on 14 days of leave of absence. RWS will work closely with MOH to monitor their condition, said a spokesperson. ""Deep cleaning, thorough disinfection and sanitisation have been carried out at all areas and touchpoints where the employee had come into contact with,"" said the spokesperson. RWS did not provide details on what role the employee held at the casino as well as how many visitors or colleagues he may have had contact with. Case 47 Case 47 is a 39-year-old male Bangladeshi worker. He had worked at 10 Seletar Aerospace Heights, said MOH, the same location as another infected Bangladeshi worker, Singapore's 42nd case, who was confirmed as having the virus on Feb 8. The man, who has no recent travel history to China, reported feeling ill on Feb 6 and sought treatment at a general practitioner clinic the next day. He went to NCID on Feb 10, where he was confirmed as a positive case. Prior to being hospitalised, he had gone to work and stayed at his rental apartment at Veerasamy Road. Bombardier, the company located at 10 Seletar Aerospace Heights, confirmed in a statement to CNA that the two workers had worked with a third-party contractor at its Singapore Service Centre expansion sites, which are at 8 Seletar Aerospace Heights and 12 Seletar Aerospace Heights. They are not employees of Bombardier. The two men had worked on different buildings on the expansion sites and never had access to the company's existing facility, said Bombardier. No cases of the virus have been reported among employees at its service centre at 10 Seletar Aerospace Heights. It is collaborating with the Health Ministry to ensure that the necessary health protocols are followed, it said. ""The health and safety of our employees is always a top priority at Bombardier, and out of an abundance of caution, Bombardier continues to take the necessary steps to ensure its operations and employees remain safe,"" said a company spokesperson. CONTACT TRACING As of noon on Tuesday, 608 of the suspect cases have tested negative for the novel coronavirus. Test results for the remaining 43 cases are pending. Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. MOH has identified 1,124 close contacts. Of the 1,021 who are still in Singapore, 989 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining 32 close contacts.  The total number of fatalities from the epidemic in China jumped past 1,000 on Tuesday after 108 new deaths, including 103 in the hard-hit Hubei province. Singapore last week raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange, prompting additional precautionary measures. The coronavirus outbreak is expected to take a toll on the tourism sector, with the Singapore Tourism Board on Tuesday saying visitor arrivals are estimated to fall by 25 per cent to 30 per cent this year. South Korea and Israel have told their citizens to defer travel to Singapore, while Indonesia and Taiwan have recommended precautions be taken when visiting the country.

CASE 35 Case 35 is a 64-year-old Singaporean taxi driver who reported first having symptoms on Jan 30. He visited Bukit Merah Polyclinic on Jan 31, was admitted to Singapore General Hospital on Feb 6 and tested positive on Feb 7. Between the time he had symptoms and when he was admitted to hospital, the man had largely stayed at his home at Henderson Crescent, except to visit Redhill Market and a hawker centre at Bukit Merah for meals. CASE 36 Case 36 is a 38-year-old Singaporean permanent resident who attended the Grand Hyatt business meeting from Jan 20 to 22. She also travelled to Johor Bahru from Jan 25 to 28. She reported symptoms on Jan 24 and visited a GP clinic on Feb 1. She was isolated and admitted to KK Women's and Children's Hospital on Feb 4, and test results confirmed the infection on Feb 7. She is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID. Prior to hospital admission, she had visited a family member at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. She lives at Bukit Batok Street 31. CASE 37 Case 37 is a 53-year-old Singaporean who worked as a private-hire car driver and lives at Jurong East Street 32. He reported onset of symptoms on Jan 30 and visited two GP clinics on Feb 1 and 3. He was admitted to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital on Feb 6 and transferred to NCID two days later after testing positive for the novel coronavirus. CASE 38 Case 38 is a 52-year-old Singaporean woman who had visited The Life Church and Missions Singapore, which has been linked to another cluster of cases. She reported onset of symptoms on Feb 3 and visited Choa Chu Kang Polyclinic the day after. She was admitted to NCID on Feb 7, where tests confirmed the infection. Prior to hospital admission, she had also visited Marina Bay Sands, Chinatown and Plaza Singapura and had travelled by public transport. She lives at Choa Chu Kang Avenue 3. CASE 39 Case 39 is a 51-year-old Singaporean man who attended the same business meeting as several other cases at Grand Hyatt, and lives at Jurong West Central. He travelled to Malaysia from Jan 23 to Feb 2. On Jan 29, he reported the onset of symptoms and visited two GP clinics on Feb 3 and 5. He was admitted to NCID on Feb 6 and tested positive for the infection on Feb 8. CASE 40 Case 40 is a 36-year-old Singaporean man who works at Yong Thai Hang and lives at Bedok North Street. He reported the onset of symptoms on Jan 30 and visited a GP clinic the same day. He was identified as a close contact of two other cases linked to the health products shop, and placed under home quarantine on Feb 4. He was admitted to NCID on Feb 7 and tested positive the following day. LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing, with the help of the police, have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases, MOH said. Nine of Singapore's cases are linked to the cluster associated with Yong Thai Hang at 24 Cavan Road in Jalan Besar. Five cases are linked to The Life Church and Missions Singapore at 146B Paya Lebar Road. Three cases are linked to the Grand Hyatt business meeting in Singapore. Investigations on these clusters are ongoing, and contact tracing is under way for the locally transmitted cases, said the ministry. SUSPECTED CASES As of Feb 8 noon, 438 of the suspected cases have tested negative for the novel coronavirus. Test results for the remaining 181 cases are pending. A total of 758 close contacts of the confirmed cases have been identified. Of the 663 who are still in Singapore, 647 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining 16 close contacts, said MOH. Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing, said the health ministry. MOH said it will continue to monitor the situation. ""As medical practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases who have recently been in China, Singapore is likely to see more cases that will need to be investigated,"" it said.  DORSCON ORANGE On Friday, Singapore raised the DORSCON level to Orange following several cases of novel coronavirus without any links to previous cases or travel history to mainland China. This means the disease is deemed severe and spreads easily from person to person, but has not spread widely and is being contained. Moderate disruption is expected, due to measures such as quarantine and visitor restrictions at hospitals. A second flight bringing Singaporeans and their family members back from Wuhan, Hubei is expected to arrive in Singapore on Sunday morning. At least 722 people have died from the virus in China while more than 34,000 have been infected, according to the latest official figures.

30 Jan 2020 08:47AM,3 Japanese evacuated from Wuhan have coronavirus: Health minister,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TOKYO: Three Japanese citizens among more than 200 evacuated from China have tested positive for the new coronavirus, Japan's health minister said Thursday (Jan 30). The three people arrived in Japan on Wednesday, on the first flight to evacuate Japanese citizens from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of a deadly outbreak that has killed 170 people and infected thousands. Two of the three had not shown any symptoms, the ministry said, according to NHK. The three evacuees raise the number of cases in Japan so far to 11, including two people who appear to have contracted the virus without travelling to China. ""In addition to the eight cases, among the people who returned from Wuhan yesterday, infection (with the new coronavirus) has been confirmed in one person with symptoms and two other people who have no symptoms,"" Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told parliament. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told lawmakers that the three returnees would be treated in a special medical facility. A total of 206 Japanese citizens landed at Tokyo's Haneda airport on Wednesday morning, with health professionals carrying out checks on board and at the airport, but no mandatory quarantine was planned. A second chartered flight with Japanese evacuees from Wuhan, which is under virtual lockdown, landed in Japan on Thursday with nine people showing symptoms of fever or coughing, broadcaster NHK report. At least one more chartered flight is expected in the coming days. The new cases come after authorities on Wednesday confirmed a second case involving someone who had not recently travelled to China. The woman was a tour guide who worked on the same bus as a driver who also contracted the virus without travelling to China. The driver told authorities he had driven two groups of tourists from Wuhan earlier in January and developed symptoms afterwards. ""The eighth case is the second suspected incident of human-to-human transmission in Japan,"" Kato said. ""We are in a truly new situation."" Foreign governments have been flying their citizens out of the area, as the number of deaths jumped and the World Health Organization has voiced ""grave concern"" about person-to-person spread in three other countries. The United States flew about 200 Americans out of Wuhan. They were being screened on arrival in California. France, Britain and Canada also have organised evacuations. More than 50 million people have been locked down in and around Wuhan, the central industrial city where the outbreak first began, in a bid by authorities to stop an infection that has since spread to other cities in China and to other countries. While some experts believe the new strain, known as ""2019-nCoV"", is not as deadly as SARS, alarm has grown over its rapid spread and many unknown attributes, such as how lethal it is. The effects of the virus are already weighing heavily on China's economy, the world's second-biggest, with companies cutting corporate travel and tourists cancelling trips. Various airlines are cutting flights, from British Airways and Lufthansa to Air Canada and American Airlines.

04 Feb 2020 06:00PM,4 locally transmitted cases among new coronavirus patients in Singapore,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore confirmed on Tuesday (Feb 4) its first locally transmitted cases of the novel coronavirus, among six new cases of the disease detected in the country. Four Singapore residents with no recent travel history to China have tested positive for the virus, which has sickened more than 20,000 and killed more than 420 people since it was detected in Wuhan in central China. One of them was a tour guide for a group of Chinese tourists, two work at a shop the group had visited, while a fourth case of local transmission was the domestic helper of one of the cases, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said at a briefing. The tour group had arrived in Singapore from China on Jan 22 and went to Malaysia from Jan 24 to 26. They re-entered Singapore via Woodlands Checkpoint at 3am on Jan 27 and flew from Changi Airport Terminal 1 at 6am. Pending confirmation from the Chinese authorities, the travellers are from Guangxi, and at least two of them have since been confirmed to have the coronavirus, said MOH. ""The Ministry of Health has commenced contact tracing to identify individuals who had close contact with these cases, so as to ring-fence the cluster and limit further spread,"" said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong.   Another two new cases announced by the authorities on Tuesday are Singapore residents who had been evacuated from Wuhan. This brings the total number of cases in Singapore to 24.   Two of the patients who caught the virus here are salespeople at Yong Thai Hang, a health product store that serves primarily Chinese tourists. They are the 19th and 20th cases reported. The tour group had visited the store, among other places, on Jan 23.   The 19th case, a 28-year-old Singapore permanent resident, reported developing a sore throat and fever on Jan 29. She went to Tan Tock Seng Hospital emergency department on Jan 30 and was discharged after a chest X-ray found she did not have pneumonia. She stayed at home from Jan 31 till Sunday before being admitted to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) on Monday.  The 20th case is a 48-year-old Singaporean woman who lives at Hougang Street 61. She reported symptoms on Jan 25 and was admitted on Monday to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). Information about her movements between Jan 25 and Monday was not provided. Case 19's maid, a 44-year-old Indonesian national, is the 21st case. She reported onset of symptoms on Sunday and did not leave her house until she was admitted to SGH the next day. A tour guide who brought tour groups to Yong Thai Hang is the 24th case. The 32-year-old Singaporean was asymptomatic when she went to NCID.   The 22nd and 23rd cases, both Singaporeans, were among 92 people evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30 and the two had no symptoms when they boarded the flight to Singapore. They were put under quarantine in Singapore and tested positive on Monday despite showing no symptoms. They are now both in isolation rooms at NCID. Authorities on Tuesday said that the four cases of local transmission are not evidence of community spread as they can be traced back to recent travellers from China and some had close contact with one another. Mr Gan elaborated on the difference between a local transmission cluster and community spread: “The main difference is that for this cluster, we could identify all the sources that were involved. The source was a group of mainland China tourists. We have their names, we have an indication of the patients that fell ill. “Therefore we could identify the specific source… If we are able to ringfence this particular cluster, we can control the spread. Therefore we say it is a limited local transmission.” But if there are multiple clusters and the Government cannot determine the source, that is when it would be labelled a widespread community transmission, he added. “When that happens, we will move to Dorscon (Dors condition) Orange. Today, we are still at Yellow.”  Currently, Singapore is at Dorscon Yellow, signifying that the virus is severe and can infect from person to person, but is chiefly occurring outside Singapore. The next step up is Dorscon Orange, whereby the virus is spreading in Singapore but not widely, and is being contained. At the heart of Singapore’s response plan is the Disease Outbreak Response System (Dors), a crisis management plan which did not exist in 2003, but was drafted after SARS and refined again in the wake of the swine flu (H1N1) pandemic in 2009. MOH's director of medical services Kenneth Mak added that even though the domestic helper of one of the cases was infected, it was in an ""enclosed setting"" within the home. ""We're still continuing to do contact tracing and we'll continue to be vigilant for more cases. There may be more cases that come out in relation to the same exposure to ... this travel group,"" he added.  Answering queries from reporters, Mr Gan said that the mode of transmission between the tour group and the patients cannot be determined, but the tour guide would have been with the tour group for a long period of time while the salespeople would have interacted with the travellers at the shop. ""It's not transient contact ... where you happen to meet (the person) on the street,"" he said. Dr Mak said that the tour guide reported that some of the travellers were coughing and sneezing while they were in Singapore but it would be ""speculative"" to say that this was the mode of transmission. As the tour group has returned to China, some of the contacts are a result of checking with the Chinese authorities, Mr Gan added.  ADDITIONAL PRECAUTIONS, CONTACT TRACING As an added precaution, individuals who, like the cases of local transmission, have had recent close contact with people with travel history to mainland China will be contacted. Authorities are also tracking the contacts of a Malaysian who had tested positive for the novel coronavirus after attending a meeting at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Singapore that involved Chinese nationals. In addition, MOH has expanded surveillance efforts to conduct 2019-nCoV testing on all individuals with pneumonia at Singapore hospitals since last week. Other measures to pre-empt possible community spread of the virus were also announced, including enhanced cleaning of public areas.  Authorities have urged places with high human traffic to step up cleaning, including food and beverage outlets, shops and hotels. ""Current evidence suggests that the likely modes of transmission are mainly through contact with droplets from infected individuals, either directly or indirectly through hands that have come into contact with these droplets,"" said MOH. ""The virus can also transmit through surface contact."" Sanitation and hygiene advisories have been disseminated by the National Environment Agency. ""I URGE SINGAPOREANS TO REMAIN CALM"" A more cautious stance will be taken with vulnerable groups like young children and the elderly, authorities said. Schools will not hold mass assemblies and recess sessions will be staggered, while school camps will be cancelled. Pre-schools facilities will suspend large-group and communal activities, while eldercare facilities will also suspend external excursions and large gatherings. Should community spread occur, more measures to reduce human interaction will be considered, authorities added. ""We are closely monitoring the situation and stand ready to ramp up our measures if necessary,"" said Mr Gan. ""I urge Singaporeans to remain calm. We will spare no effort to protect our people."" ONE MAN DISCHARGED The 18 earlier confirmed cases in Singapore all had recent travel history to Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. In an update, MOH said one of the cases was discharged on Tuesday after testing negative for the virus. The patient discharged, a 35-year-old man from Wuhan who, was the seventh case detected in Singapore.  Many of the remaining cases are improving and at least two are asymptomatic; several need oxygen support but none are critically ill. Chief Health Scientist Tan Chorh Chuan said that many of the patients are on supportive treatment while a small number are on an antiretroviral combination of Lopinavir and Ritonavir. As of noon on Tuesday, 289 suspect cases have tested negative for 2019 novel coronavirus and test results for 20 cases are pending. As a precaution, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. All other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be contacted daily to monitor the status of their health. MOH has also identified 311 close contacts. Of the 239 who are still in Singapore, 234 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. The ministry is trying to contact the remaining five.  On Saturday, Singapore widened travel restrictions to bar all new visitors with recent travel history to mainland China from Singapore. These visitors are also not allowed to transit in Singapore. The coronavirus has killed more than 400 people and infected more than 20,000 around the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the virus outbreak a global emergency. Hong Kong on Monday reported the city's first fatality from the coronavirus, and the second outside mainland China.

18 Jan 2020 03:30AM,US to screen passengers for new China coronavirus at three airports,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners WASHINGTON: The United States will begin screening efforts at three U.S. airports to detect travelers from the central Chinese city of Wuhan who may have symptoms of a new respiratory virus that so far has killed two people and infected 45 more, public health officials said on Friday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the screening at the San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles airports will begin later on Friday and focus on travelers to the United States via direct or connecting flights from Wuhan. So far, the new virus has spread outside of China to Japan and Thailand, and CDC officials said in a conference call with reporters that they expect more cases will be reported outside of China. The risk to Americans is deemed to be low, the CDC said. Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, said in a conference call that the CDC will be sending about 100 additional staff to the three airports - Los Angeles International, San Francisco International and New York's John F. Kennedy International - to supplement existing staff at quarantine stations located at those airports. Under the screening procedures, travelers from Wuhan will be taken to a separate area in the airport, where they will complete a questionnaire and be checked for fever. Those with symptoms will be asked additional health- and exposure-related questions, and those needing more follow-up will be referred to a designated healthcare facility for more testing. The Chinese virus is a coronavirus, a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, a highly infectious virus that originated in China in 2002 and eventually traveled to 37 countries, killing 774 people. So far, health officials do not consider the new virus from China to be as lethal as SARS, but the investigation is evolving and much is still not known about whether the virus can spread easily from person to person. ""This is the stage of the investigation where we need to proceed cautiously and be prepared for any eventuality,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, a CDC expert in respiratory diseases, said on the conference call. China health officials report that most of the patients infected with the virus have had exposure to a large market where live animals were present, suggesting the virus is new and has jumped from animals to humans. It is still not clear how well the virus can be transmitted from person to person, but there are indications of some limited spread from person-to-person, CDC officials said. The World Health Organization earlier this week provided guidance to hospitals worldwide about infection prevention and control in case the new virus spreads. There is no specific treatment for the new virus, but anti-virals are being considered. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Copyright© Mediacorp 2020. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

05 Feb 2020 07:01AM,China coronavirus death toll rises to 490 as more countries confirm local transmission,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The number of confirmed deaths from China's coronavirus outbreak jumped on Wednesday (Feb 5) to nearly 500, after Hong Kong reported its first death from the disease and millions more in China were ordered to stay indoors. The confirmed toll in mainland China rose to 490 after hardest-hit Hubei province reported 65 more people had died - the biggest single-day tally since the first fatalities emerged last month. The number of confirmed infections in China's coronavirus outbreak has reached 24,324 nationwide with 3,887 new cases reported, the National Health Commission said. More than 20 countries have confirmed cases of the virus, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a global health emergency, several governments to institute travel restrictions, and airlines to suspend flights to and from China. The WHO said Tuesday that the dramatic measures taken by China had provided a ""window of opportunity"" to halt transmission, while calling for more global solidarity to combat the virus.   The novel coronavirus has continued to spread with Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand on Tuesday reporting new infections that were not imported from China. In a sign of growing concern about a spread to other densely-populated Chinese metropolitan areas, authorities in three cities in eastern Zhejiang province - including one near Shanghai - limited the number of people allowed to leave their homes. Three districts in Hangzhou - including the area where the main office of Chinese tech giant Alibaba is based - now allow only one person per household to go outside every two days to buy necessities, affecting some three million people. The city is only 175km southwest of the financial hub of Shanghai, which has reported more than 200 cases, including one death.   Zhejiang has confirmed 829 cases - the highest number outside the central province of Hubei, whose capital Wuhan is the epicentre of the outbreak. The disease is believed to have emerged in December in a Wuhan market that sold wild animals, and spread rapidly as people travelled for the Lunar New Year holiday in January. China has struggled to contain the virus despite enacting unprecedented measures, including virtually locking down more than 50 million people in Hubei.   The WHO has said the outbreak does not yet constitute a ""pandemic"". The head of the organisation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, accused wealthy countries of falling short on their duties in sharing data, stating that: ""Of the 176 cases reported outside China so far, WHO has received complete case report forms for only 38 per cent."" HONG KONG'S FIRST DEATH The death of the 39-year-old man in Hong Kong came as the semi-autonomous city closed all but two land crossings with the Chinese mainland. Hong Kong media said the man had underlying health issues. He had visited Wuhan last month and his 72-year-old mother was also infected. The financial hub has been particularly on edge over the virus as it has revived memories of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002-03, which killed nearly 300 people in the city and 349 people in the mainland. Health officials noted that the mortality rate for the new coronavirus stood at 2.1 per cent, with most victims either old or with underlying health problems. SARS killed nearly 10 per cent of patients. NEW FOREIGN CASES Singapore confirmed the first four cases of people being infected locally, taking the total number of infections to 24. In another example of growing global anxiety, Japan has quarantined a cruise ship carrying 3,711 people and was testing those onboard for the virus after a former passenger was diagnosed with the illness in Hong Kong. Macau, China's semi-autonomous gambling hub that is popular with mainland Chinese visitors, decided to temporarily close all of its casinos for at least two weeks. And the UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Tuesday advised Britons to leave China, ""if they can"", to minimise their risk of exposure to the virus. The United States, meanwhile, acknowledged that the outbreak may delay Beijing's plans to purchase American goods under the terms of a deal meant to end the two countries' trade war. BEIJING ADMITS 'SHORTCOMINGS' China's Communist leadership made a rare admission of fallibility earlier this week, acknowledging ""shortcomings and difficulties exposed in the response to the epidemic"". The elite Politburo Standing Committee called for improvements to the ""national emergency management system"" at the meeting, according to the official Xinhua news agency on Monday. The government also said it ""urgently"" needed medical equipment such as surgical masks, protective suits, and safety goggles as it battles the outbreak. Most of the deaths have been in Wuhan and the rest of surrounding Hubei province, which has largely been under lockdown for almost two weeks. A 1,000-bed field hospital in Wuhan built from scratch within two weeks to relieve overburdened medical facilities started receiving patients on Tuesday, with a second makeshift hospital due to open later this week. A cultural building, an exhibition centre and a gymnasium have also been converted into improvised clinics with 3,400 beds. State media reported that the city planned to convert an additional eight facilities into hospitals.

06 Feb 2020 12:29AM,"What we know about the 4 new coronavirus cases in Singapore, including 6-month-old baby","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Four new cases of the novel coronavirus in Singapore – including a six-month-old baby – were confirmed on Wednesday (Feb 5). Three of the four new cases are linked to the local transmission cluster announced by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Tuesday. The fourth case is linked to a patient confirmed in January. The four patients are in stable condition, MOH said. Wednesday's announcement brings the total number of cases in Singapore to 28. This is what we know about cases 25, 26, 27 and 28: Cases 25, 27 and 28 are part of a local cluster of transmission involving cases 19, 20, 21 and 24, which can be traced to a Chinese tour group. The tour group from Guangxi comprised 20 tourists who had visited Singapore last month. Two travellers from that group have tested positive for the coronavirus, Chinese health authorities confirmed. During their time in Singapore, they visited at least six places in Singapore, including Yong Thai Hang, a health product shop.   CASES 27 AND 28 Cases 27 and 28 are family members of case 19 – a 28-year-old Singapore permanent resident who works as a salesperson at Yong Thai Hang. All three do not have recent travel history to China. The salesperson was tested positive for the coronavirus on Monday and is warded at Singapore General Hospital (SGH). Case 27 is her husband, a 45-year-old Singaporean who tested positive for the virus on Wednesday at about 2pm. He is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). He developed symptoms on Feb 1 and visited a general practitioner clinic the next day. He was subsequently isolated at NCID on Feb 4. Prior to hospital admission, he stayed at his home at Jalan Bukit Merah and worked as a private hire driver. He indicated that he had visited Tiong Bahru Plaza, Tiong Bahru Market and Beo Crescent Market and Food Centre. The risk of infection from transient contact, such as on public transport or in public places, is assessed to be low, MOH said. Case 28 is the couple’s six-month-old son. He also tested positive on Wednesday at about 2pm, and is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. MOH said in an update on Thursday that the child was not in any infant care facility and was cared for at home, prior to being admitted to the hospital. The family’s foreign domestic worker (case 21), an Indonesian national with no recent travel history to China, is also warded with the virus at SGH. Case 20, a colleague of Case 19 at Yong Thai Hang, was admitted to NCID on Monday and tested positive. CASE 25 Case 25 is the husband of case 24, a 32-year-old Singaporean woman who works as a tourist guide and brought visitors to Yong Thai Hang. She had gone to NCID on Monday and was confirmed positive on Tuesday at about 2pm. “While she had previously reported that she was asymptomatic when she went to NCID, she subsequently informed NCID on (Tuesday) night that she had developed a fever on Jan 30,” MOH said.  Prior to admission to NCID, she stayed at her home at Buangkok Green and worked at Jalan Besar. She had visited Hougang Polyclinic on Jan 30 and went to a supermarket near her home. Her husband - case 25 - is a 40-year-old Singaporean who developed a fever on Jan 24. He visited the same polyclinic as his wife on Jan 30, and self-presented at NCID on Monday, where he was immediately isolated. He was tested positive on Tuesday, at about 8pm. Prior to being admitted, case 25 had stayed at home. He worked at Diamond Industries Jewellery Company at Harbour Drive, which the tour group from Guangxi had visited as well. He had also visited Pasir Panjang Hawker Centre and travelled by public transport. “The risk of infection from transient contact, such as on public transport or in public places, is assessed to be low,” MOH said. CASE 26 Case 26 - a 42-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan - is the daughter of a previously confirmed case, case 13. They arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 21. She was conveyed by ambulance to NCID on the same day as her 73-year-old mother on Jan 28 after developing symptoms. Subsequent test results confirmed on Tuesday that she was infected with the coronavirus. The elderly woman was a close contact of the second confirmed case, who also arrived in Singapore on Jan 21.     OTHER PLACES THE TOUR GROUP VISITED The tour group of 20 had arrived in Singapore on Jan 22 and left for Malaysia on Jan 24. On Jan 27, the group came back to Singapore at about 3am and they left the country at about 6am, MOH said. Besides Yong Thai Hang and Diamond Industries Jewellery Company, the group also visited: “It has been almost 14 days since the tourists visited these places,” MOH said. The ministry has reached out to 142 contacts, of which all but one are well. The person has been isolated as a suspect case and test results are pending. Contact tracing was also conducted for the crew and passengers of the departing flight on Jan 27. Five are in Singapore and have been quarantined. As of 11.59pm last Saturday, all new visitors with recent travel history to mainland China will not be allowed to enter Singapore. These visitors will also not be allowed to transit in Singapore. Those with Chinese passports, with the exception of Singapore permanent residents (PRs) and long-term pass holders, will also not be allowed to enter Singapore.

11 Feb 2020 05:55AM,"OG cuts shopping hours, Honestbee temporarily closes grocery store over coronavirus fears","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: At least two retailers in Singapore have announced shorter business hours or temporary store closures in light of the novel coronavirus outbreak. This comes after Singapore stepped up its risk assessment of the new flu-like virus last week and amid local transmission of the virus, which started in China and has since killed more than 900 and infected more than 40,000. One of them is department store OG, which adjusted its store operating hours shortly after authorities announced the upgrade in the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Friday (Feb 7). Its three stores, which used to be opened from 11am to 9.30pm daily, will now close at 8.30pm “until further notice”. This is so that employees “can go home earlier ... in this critical period of fighting the coronavirus outbreak”, OG said in response to queries from CNA. In line with the heightened measures, OG said it has begun temperature checks for all employees and visitors to its office. Promoters, delivery personnel and other staff entering its department stores must also use masks at all times. Prior to that, it had taken other measures such as increased disinfection of floors, toilets and frequently touched surfaces like railings, lift buttons and escalator. It also said that only one out of its 26 employees from China had recently travelled back home. This employee is currently on a 14-day leave of absence until Feb 18. On whether crowds have thinned at its department stores, OG’s spokesperson told CNA that it has been monitoring developments since reopening for business on Jan 27 after the Chinese New Year holidays. Before that, even though Singapore confirmed its first infected patient on Jan 23, OG “did not see a distinct drop in customers yet, especially since it was still the pre-Chinese New Year shopping period”. But after the Chinese New Year break and with the DORSCON level at Yellow, the mall “began to see a decline in footfall and business”, with stores becoming “very quiet after 7pm”. In particular, its department store at People’s Park saw the biggest drop in walk-in traffic, the spokesperson told CNA. BHG Holdings also saw a big hit in sales, with transactions across its six outlets dropping between 40 to 50 per cent since the first confirmed case on Jan 23. The chain department store said it will not adjust opening hours at the moment, although it “may review again if the situation changes”. Similarly at Robinsons, operating hours for its three stores remain unchanged for now. Both BHG and Robinsons said they have put in place precautionary measures in line with guidelines from the authorities. Mandatory temperature checks are being carried out, while surgical masks are on hand for employees who feel unwell, they told CNA. They have also stepped up the cleaning of their department stores and commonly-used areas, with Robinsons having a cleaning schedule of sanitising every 2 hours. BHG is also looking to split its front-end staff into two teams so as “to minimise the physical contact (and) lowering the risk of infection”. It added that it also has two employees who are on the 14-day leave of absence, after returning from China on Jan 27 and Feb 4, respectively. Metro and Isetan did not reply by the time this article was published, but a quick check with its customer service centres showed no change in opening hours. HONESTBEE TEMPORARILY CLOSES HABITAT Separately, retail start-up Honestbee has temporarily closed its tech-integrated grocery store Habitat from Monday until Feb 23. The suspension of the grocery store, which is located in Pasir Panjang and also houses a dine-in area, “may be extended if necessary”, according to a company spokesperson.   “We have chosen to temporarily suspend habitat by honestbee as a proactive approach to combat community transmission in light of the increase in novel coronavirus cases and the elevated DORSCON risk assessment status,” she said. Since Singapore confirmed its first case of the coronavirus, footfall in the grocery store has fallen about 60 per cent, with the impact most noticeable during dinner time on weekdays, the spokesperson added. Honestbee has stopped its food delivery and laundry services since May 2019, as it embarks on a court-supervised debt restructuring. It will continue to operate its online grocery delivery service, its announcement on Monday said.

31 Jan 2020 06:06PM,Wuhan coronavirus: Singapore to widen travel restrictions to all new visitors who recently travelled to mainland China,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: In an effort to minimise the risk of community spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, new visitors of any nationality with recent travel history to mainland China will not be allowed to enter Singapore, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said on Friday (Jan 31). These visitors will also not be allowed to transit in Singapore, as part of restrictions that will come into effect at 11.59pm on Saturday. Those with Chinese passports, with the exception of Singapore permanent residents (PRs) and long-term pass holders, will also not be allowed to enter Singapore. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) will, with immediate effect, suspend the issuance of all forms of new visas to those with Chinese passports. Singapore's status as a visa-free transit facility will be suspended for Chinese passport holders. Previously issued short-term and multiple-visit visas for those with Chinese passports will also be suspended. Those who hold such visas will not be allowed into Singapore during this period.   In a press release on Friday evening, the Manpower Ministry also announced that with immediate effect, it will reject all new work pass applications for foreign workers from mainland China until further notice. Renewal applications for existing work pass holders will not be affected.  Earlier this week, the restrictions only applied to new visitors who had recently travelled to China's Hubei province. However, China recently announced that the number of reported infections in the country had doubled since Jan 28 to more than 9,000 and that the likelihood of widespread community transmission in other parts of China is now high. ""As a result, we are likely to see a sharper rise in the local transmission of the virus in Chinese cities beyond the Hubei province in the coming days,"" said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a press release on Friday. At the briefing, Mr Wong also said that Singapore residents with recent travel history to mainland China will be issued a travel advisory and asked to take a 14-day leave of absence. These include Singapore citizens, PRs as well as those with long-term passes. Commissioner of ICA Marvin Sim, who was at the briefing, said the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore will be disseminating the information to all airlines to ensure smooth implementation of the new measures. Cabin crew who have to travel to China as part of their job will not be subject to the new measures, but in consultation with the Health Ministry, will have to take precautionary measures, he said. They will only be able to enter or transit if they are well, he added. “These additional travel restrictions on top of all that we have already introduced over the past few days will enable us to limit the number of new cases here and to reduce the risk of community spread in Singapore,” said Mr Wong, who co-chairs a ministerial task force set up to deal with the coronavirus situation. Responding to a question from the media, Mr Wong stressed that the restrictions are not nationality-based. ""It is not a nationality issue,"" he said. ""The motivation is the origins of the virus and that beyond Hubei, the virus is now spreading to other parts of China - as we have said, there is assessment that this is happening."" When asked for a clarification that all Chinese passport holders who are not residents of Singapore will be barred from Singapore regardless of their previous travel, Mr Wong said: ""This is the policy because it is difficult to know your previous travel history."" At the operational level, there may be appeals,"" he added. The passport is being used as a ""proxy"", he said. ""I can imagine somebody may say 'I’m a passport holder, but I have not be in China all this while'. I think we can take that separate from the policy, and at the operational level, ICA will have to deal with these instances,"" he said.  Meanwhile, MOH's director of medical services Kenneth Mak said there remains no evidence of community spread. Of those suspected of having the coronavirus, 164 of them have been ruled out while test results are still pending for 49 others. “The situation remains fluid, it is constantly changing. We do not rule out taking further measures,” Mr Wong said.

04 Feb 2020 06:30AM,Commentary: Novel coronavirus reveals old vulnerabilities in the global economy,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners The novel coronavirus has the potential to become a big enough shock that reveals the weaknesses of central banks and sluggish global growth, says Mohamed El-Erian. NEWPORT BEACH, California: Last week’s fretting over the coronavirus was a good illustration of a tug of war that has been playing out in financial markets for a while: Between favourable sentiment and mounting longer-term economic uncertainties. Until now, at least, that contest has been resolved in favour of ever-higher stock prices. But investors need to decide if they want to opt for more of the same, by continuing to implement an investment playbook that has served them well, or if they want to treat the viral outbreak for what it is — a big economic shock that could derail global growth and shake markets out of their “buy-the-dip” conditioning. Entering 2020, investors faced the challenge of balancing favourable short-term market technicals with weaker fundamentals, and doing so with government bonds providing little protection given the very low — and, in some cases, negative — level of yields in advanced countries. NOVEL VULNERABILITIES The coronavirus outbreak amplifies two vulnerabilities: Structurally weak global growth and less effective central banks. It is becoming harder for markets to treat such fragilities as being beyond the immediate horizon, especially with a host of other uncertainties not far behind, including the recurrence of trade tensions, growing realisation of the impact of climate change, technological shocks, political polarisation and changing demographics. Retail, trade and travel are simple ways to illustrate what is going on in China. Stores are facing dramatic disruptions involving a virtual halt in traffic, while suppliers are finding it harder and slower to move their merchandise, both within and in and out of the country. And there is a huge drop in travel to China, dealing another blow to economic activities undermined by less internal mobility. This virtual stoppage of economic activities is cascading throughout the second-largest economy in the world, and one with considerable regional and global ties. It is fundamentally weakening the country’s services sector, at a time of considerable challenges for manufacturing. CHINA SLOWDOWN With both engines of growth now sputtering, internal and external, China will also find it harder to navigate its transition from a middle-income economy. The country’s increasing “sudden stop” economic dynamics also involve adverse spill-over effects, first and foremost for emerging Asian economies with strong economic and financial linkages with China.   A weakening China is also a problem for Europe, where the European Central Bank is effectively out of productive ammunition and politicians are yet to implement a comprehensive pro-growth policy package. And with the virus affecting the movement of people and goods, there is an increased risk of a multi-year process of de-globalisation that neither the global economy nor markets are wired for. The coronavirus also has the potential to constitute a structural break for markets: A big enough shock that fundamentally shifts sentiment. NEW GAME PLAN Previously, markets had been underpinned by the belief that central banks were always willing and able to repress volatility and boost asset prices. That fuelled investors’ fear of missing out on a seemingly never-ending rally. Until last Friday (Jan 31) when US stocks dropped about 2 per cent, markets’ inclination was to respond to sell-offs by deploying a game plan that worked well in 2019 and early 2020, including in response to shocks such as the US missile attack that killed a top Iranian general and the disruption to half of Saudi Arabia’s oil production.   For the previous year, traders and investors quickly bought every dip in the belief that the latest shock would prove temporary, contained and reversible. Now, the multi-year gap between elevated asset prices and weaker economic conditions is becoming increasingly unsustainable. The global economy and markets are getting closer to the neck of a T-junction. What comes after that involves a stark contrast, depending on how policymakers respond. One way involves recession, financial instability and even more complicated politics; the other, a genuine growth process that validates elevated asset prices in an orderly fashion and opens the way for more constructive politics. If investors still insist on immediately buying dips, they should do so in a much more differentiated manner by favouring higher-quality issuers that are underpinned by strong balance sheets. They should also avoid swapping US assets for more international exposure, which — although more attractively valued — is much less resilient to global economic weakness. For the remainder, which is probably most investors, they should consider that this latest shock to fundamentals could prove severe enough to dislodge for a while the bullish market conditioning that has been so critical to this historic stock rally. Given that the negative economic effects of the virus are yet to be sufficiently absorbed by markets, this also calls for much greater immediate attention to potential vulnerabilities in portfolios, in the form of equity and liquidity risk.

06 Feb 2020 04:21PM,"First locally transmitted case of novel coronavirus in Malaysia, total cases rise to 14","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia confirmed on Thursday (Feb 6) its first locally transmitted case of the novel coronavirus, with the patient being the sister of the Malaysian man who attended a conference in Singapore and later tested positive for the virus. Additionally, a Chinese female tourist from Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, was also tested positive on Wednesday, bringing the total number of cases in Malaysia to 14, Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad said. Elaborating on the case of the Malaysian woman, Dr Dzukefly said the 40-year-old had direct contact with her brother while they were celebrating Chinese New Year at their hometown on Jan 23. “She started having fever and sore throat on Feb 1, and started coughing on Feb 4. She received treatment at a private clinic. “After her brother was confirmed to have the coronavirus, she was tracked down by the Kuala Muda health authorities (in Kedah state). Samples were taken from her and her family members, and she was tested positive on Feb 5,” he said. She is now being treated at Hospital Sultanah Bahiyah, Alor Setar, and is in stable condition. Her other family members – husband and two teenage children – tested negative, the minister said. ""Her brother is considered the first Malaysian imported case, while she is the first Malaysian transmitted, local case,"" Dr Dzulkefly said. As for the case of the Chinese tourist, Dr Dzukefly said she arrived in Malaysia on Jan 25 together with her mother and three friends. The woman, 37, received treatment for mild fever on Feb 1 at Kuala Lumpur Hospital and was placed under home surveillance. When she was found to be still showing the symptoms, she was referred to the hospital again to be warded for treatment and further investigation on Wednesday. She tested positive on the same day and is now being treated in an isolated ward. Separately, a Canadian national who was sent by a hazmat team from the Kuala Lumpur City Centre to the hospital, tested negative for the coronavirus, Dr Dzulkefly said.

09 Feb 2020 02:19PM,Singapore Airshow organiser to limit public day tickets amid coronavirus concerns,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The organiser of the Singapore Airshow plans to sell fewer tickets to the public as part of measures against the novel coronavirus, as it confirmed more than 70 participating companies have pulled out. Experia Events managing director Leck Chet Lam said he expects ticket sales to be “significantly less than half” compared to the previous edition of the airshow in 2018, which attracted nearly 80,000 public visitors over two days. “We are looking at how we can have a smaller public day attendance,” he told reporters on Sunday (Feb 9), adding that there is also an idea to sell less tickets ""so that the attendance will be controlled.” He did not say how many public day tickets have currently been sold or what the allocation is. When asked what will happen to existing ticket holders if the limit is exceeded, Mr Leck said the organiser will “work it out” with them. “That’s also part of looking at the situation and making sure we take care of the well-being of people who are attending the show,” he added. Mr Leck also revealed that more than 70 participating companies have pulled out of attending the airshow, although he said this represents less than eight per cent of the initial turnout. Nineteen exhibitors have confirmed they are not attending, including US defence contractor Lockheed Martin. This means there will be 10 to 15 fewer static aircraft displays than the 45 in 2018, Mr Leck said. This comes after Singapore on Friday raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange, as authorities announced three new cases of the virus, bringing the total to 40. Under the new DORSCON level, organisers of large events should take necessary precautions such as carrying out temperature screening, looking out for respiratory symptoms like cough or runny nose, and denying entry to unwell individuals. The Ministry of Health had also urged organisers to cancel or defer non-essential large-scale events. AIRSHOW WILL GO ON When asked if the airshow will be cancelled if the DORSCON level was raised to the maximum Red, Mr Leck said the organiser will refer to guidelines by the relevant authorities. As for now, Mr Leck said the airshow – which he described as an “important node” in the global aviation industry – will go on. “Our responsibility is to still carry on with the show so exhibitors and trade visitors continue to have a platform to meet and talk about business opportunities,” he said. “Those who have pulled out, we respect their decision. Those who chose to come, we also respect it, and how we respect that is we put all the necessary preventive measures on site to make sure their well-being is taken care of.”   As part of measures against the outbreak, the organiser has implemented seat tagging for all seated events to facilitate contact tracing, and temperature screening at Singapore Expo and Changi Exhibition Centre access points. The organiser also encourages alternative greetings among attendees like waving or bowing, instead of the conventional handshake. This is in addition to measures like more frequent cleaning, having doctors and medics on site, and making hand sanitisers available. Mr Leck said the public will have to “make their own decisions” on whether they should buy a ticket. “But if they choose to come to the show, we have put all the precautionary measures in place,” he added.

21 Jan 2020 10:48AM,Wuhan pneumonia outbreak: A timeline of how the new coronavirus spread,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: A new coronavirus, a mysterious SARS-like disease, has spread around China and to other countries since first emerging in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. A timeline of how the virus has spread: ALARM RAISED BY CHINA The World Health Organization (WHO) is alerted on Dec 31, 2019, by Chinese authorities of a string of pneumonia-like cases in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. Patients are quarantined and work begins on identifying the origin of the pneumonia. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies a seafood market suspected to be at the centre of the outbreak. The market is closed on Jan 1, 2020. SINGAPORE STARTS SCREENINGS AT AIRPORT On Jan 2, Singapore's Ministry of Health (MOH) says it is aware of the pneumonia outbreak and is monitoring the situation closely. Temperature screening will be implemented for all travellers arriving at Changi Airport from Wuhan and suspected cases will be referred to hospitals for further assessment. NEW CORONAVIRUS On Jan 9, the WHO says that the outbreak in Wuhan was caused by a previously unknown type of coronavirus, which is a broad family ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses like SARS. Fifty-nine people have been infected, of whom seven are in a serious condition, according to an official toll. FIRST DEATH Chinese health authorities say a first person has died of the virus on Jan 11. They revise downwards the number of sick people to 41.   SPREADS BEYOND CHINA On Jan 13, the virus spreads beyond China's borders for the first time, with a case emerging in Thailand, according to the WHO. The victim is a Chinese woman diagnosed with mild pneumonia who was returning from a trip to Wuhan. On Jan 15, China's health commission says no human-to-human transmission of the virus behind the Wuhan outbreak has been confirmed so far, but the possibility ""cannot be excluded"". The next day a first case of the virus is confirmed in Japan in someone who had stayed in Wuhan in early January.   US CONTROLS On Jan 17, a second person, a 69-year-old man, dies in Wuhan, according to authorities. The same day, the US CDC announces that it will begin screening passengers arriving from Wuhan at three airports: San Francisco, New York's JFK and Los Angeles. HUMAN-TO-HUMAN TRANSMISSION CONFIRMED On Jan 20, a third death and more than 100 new cases are announced in China, sparking concerns ahead of the annual Chinese New Year holiday which begins on Jan 25 and sees hundreds of millions of Chinese people travel nationwide. The virus is present in Beijing in the north, Shanghai in the east and Shenzhen in the south. More than 200 cases have been recorded. The virus is also detected in South Korea in a Chinese person who has arrived by plane from Wuhan. China's President Xi Jinping says that the virus must be ""resolutely contained"", in his first public comments on the outbreak. Human-to-human transmission is ""affirmative"", a top Chinese expert on infectious diseases Zhong Nanshan tells state broadcaster CCTV.   COUNTRIES STEP UP AIRPORT SCREENINGS Singapore's MOH says on Jan 20 that temperature screening at Changi Airport will be extended to all travellers arriving from China. Individuals with pneumonia who had travelled to Wuhan within 14 days before the onset of symptoms will be isolated in hospital. On Jan 21, Australia announces it will begin screening passengers from some flights from China. DEATH TOLL AT 6, MEDICAL WORKERS ILL Wuhan's mayor tells state television that the death toll has risen to six. According to state media, the number of infected patients has spiked to 291, a jump of more than 70 cases from the previously reported 218 patients. It also confirms 15 medical workers in Wuhan have been diagnosed with pneumonia, with an additional worker suspected of having the disease. Separately, China's eastern Zhejiang provincial health authority says a total of five cases of new coronavirus were confirmed as of noon on Jan 21.   VIRUS SPREADS BEYOND ASIA FOR THE FIRST TIME TO THE US On Jan 21, the CDC announces the US' first case of the virus. A US resident in his 30s who lives near Seattle approached authorities after reading about the SARS-like virus in news reports. The man entered the country on Jan 15 after travelling to Wuhan, two days before the US began deploying health officials at major airports to screen passengers arriving from that central Chinese city which is at the heart of the outbreak. The efforts are to be extended now to a total of five US airports. DEATH TOLL CLIMBS On Jan 22, an official from China's national health commission says the death toll as of Jan 21 is nine. There are a total of 440 confirmed cases across 13 provinces in China and more than 2,000 cases of close contact have also been detected. The commission's deputy head Li Bin tells reporters the coronavirus is transmitted via the respiratory tract and there is ""the possibility of viral mutation and further spread of the disease"".  MORE CASES OUTSIDE CHINA Two new cases are reported in Thailand on Jan 22 - a Thai woman who visited Wuhan and a male Chinese tourist. Both are being treated in medical facilities outside Bangkok. Macau confirms its first case, a 52-year-old businesswoman from Wuhan who went to hospital on Jan 21. Local authorities announce temperature checks at entry points, with visitors required to fill in a health declaration form. Casinos have also been provided with portable screening devices and all casino staff are required to wear surgical masks. North Korea announces it will ban tourists in a bid to keep the virus out of the country. Singapore announces it has set up a ministerial task force to deal with the Wuhan virus. Health Minister Gan Kim Yong says an imported case reaching its shores is ""inevitable"". DEATH TOLL NEARLY DOUBLES State television reports on the night of Jan 22 that the death toll has risen to 17, with the number of confirmed cases in Hubei rising to 444 as of 8pm local time. The next day, China confirms a further spike in the number of people who have the disease, taking the number of cases to 571. WUHAN QUARANTINED An effective quarantine in Wuhan kicks in at 2am on Jan 23, with flights and trains out of the city suspended and the city's public buses, subway and long-distance coaches also halted until further notice. The city has also warned people to avoid entering or leaving Wuhan. SINGAPORE CONFIRMS ITS FIRST CASE Singapore confirmed its first case of the Wuhan virus on the evening of Jan 24. A 66-year-old male Wuhan resident, who arrived in Singapore with his family on Jan 20, is currently in isolation at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and is in stable condition. The man went to SGH on Jan 22 and was immediately isolated. He was identified by the Ministry of Health as a suspect case at 10pm on Jan 22 and was tested positive for the new coronavirus at 6pm on Jan 23. The man stayed at Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa and indicated that he kept within the hotel vicinity.   Shangri-La Group who managed the hotel said that the hotel room at the resort that the man occupied has been ""thoroughly disinfected and sanitised"".  CHINA SEALS OFF MORE CITIES China shuts the city of Huangang on Jan 23. The city had reported at least 12 cases of the coronavirus. Indoor entertainment venues including movie theatres and internet cafes to shut, and asked citizens not to leave the city other than under special circumstances. By Jan 24, China suspended public transportation in at least 14 cities around the epicentre of a deadly virus outbreak, affecting the movement of about 41 million people ahead of Chinese New Year this weekend.   SINGAPORE BEGINS TEMPERATURE SCREENING AT LAND AND SEA CHECKPOINTS Temperature screening for travellers arriving at Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints began at noon on Jan 24. The screening is also being implemented in anticipation of increase in travel volume leading up to the Chinese New Year holidays, according to Immigration and Checkpoints Authority. Singapore's sea checkpoints temperature screening also started at noon, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore said in response to CNA's queries. SECOND DEATH OUTSIDE OF EPICENTRE China on Jan 24 confirmed a second death outside of Wuhan. The SARS-like virus outbreak has infected hundreds of people, raising the overall death toll to 26 dead. The number of confirmed cases had leapt to 830, according to the National Health Commission said on Jan 24.  TWO MORE CASES CONFIRMED IN SINGAPORE Two more people tested positive for the Wuhan virus in Singapore, bringing the total number of cases to three, the Ministry of Health announced on Jan 24. The new patients included the 37-year-old son of the first confirmed case, MOH said in a media briefing in the afternoon. The second new confirmed case was a 53-year-old woman from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore on a Scoot flight at 5.30am on Jan 21. She was flagged by the ministry on Thursday as a preliminary positive case. MOH said that the woman had reported that she was asymptomatic during the flight to Singapore. She sought medical attention at Raffles Hospital the next day and was later taken to the emergency department at Tan Tock Seng Hospital and immediately isolated.

11 Feb 2020 04:42PM,Taiwan hits out at China coronavirus travel bans,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TAIPEI: Taiwan on Tuesday (Feb 11) hit out at countries that ""confuse"" it with China after the Philippines became the latest to impose a travel ban on the island over the deadly coronavirus outbreak. Despite its cultural links and close proximity to China, Taiwan moved swiftly against the outbreak and currently has just 18 confirmed cases of the new virus. But the self-ruled democracy has found itself increasingly caught up in travel restrictions aimed at China, where the outbreak has killed more than 1,000 people and infected over 42,000. Late Monday the Philippines confirmed its current travel ban for China was being expanded to Taiwan under the so-called ""one China"" policy. Beijing views Taiwan as its own territory - part of a ""one China"" - and has vowed to eventually take the island, by force if necessary. Taiwan's foreign ministry on Tuesday described that decision as ""wrong and unilateral"". ""To confuse Taiwan with China has caused troubles for our side and in the international community,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou told reporters. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has worked in recent years to warm ties with China in search of trade and investment. Critics in the Philippines have accused him of failing to stand up to Beijing on key issues, like its expansive claims to the disputed South China Sea. The Philippines has so far not enacted any travel bans to countries like Singapore, South Korea, Japan and Thailand even though they have more confirmed infections than Taiwan. In recent years Beijing has pursued its ""One China"" view more aggressively, freezing Taiwan out of international bodies like the World Health Organization and pressuring businesses to list the island as part of China. The coronavirus outbreak has vividly illustrated this isolation, with Taiwan the only place currently experiencing an outbreak that is not a part of the WHO. As the virus has spread, some countries have included Taiwan in their own China travel bans. Italy has banned flights by Taiwanese carriers, Bangladesh has stopped Taiwanese travellers from entering while Mongolia initially enacted a ban and then said it would review visa applications on a case by case basis. Taiwanese officials abroad have been communicating with various governments to clarify that Taiwan ""is not part of the People's Republic of China"", Ou said. Taiwan has also contained the outbreak and has reported no community infection cases, she added. When asked if Taipei suspected Beijing was pressuring Manila to expand the travel ban, Ou said: ""China's shadow is lurking ... I think the Chinese factor is obvious."" Taiwan said it would continue to communicate with Manila and said it had persuaded some countries including South Korean, Vietnam and Jordan to lift travel restrictions.

10 Feb 2020 01:45PM,66 more people found to have coronavirus on Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TOKYO: Testing aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan has found 66 more confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, domestic broadcaster TBS TV said via Twitter on Monday (Feb 10). Other local media also reported approximately 66 more cases had been confirmed, raising the number of infected passengers and crew to around 136. Health ministry officials declined immediate comment. The liner was placed on a two-week quarantine on arriving at Yokohama on Feb 3, after a former passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong last month was diagnosed with the virus.   There were more than 3,700 passengers and crew on the ship when it arrived off Japan's coast last week - this includes five Singaporeans, who reported to be physically well on Friday.   Dozens have been taken to hospital and around 3,600 people, many of them elderly, were still on board on Sunday. It was not clear whether Japanese authorities would conduct tests on all of them. The ship docked in Yokohama on Sunday to resupply for a quarantine that could last until Feb 19. Local reports said Japan's health authorities brought urgently needed drugs and other medical supplies to about 500 people. About 100 said they had a fever or felt unwell, according to the reports. Passengers on the ship have been asked to stay inside their cabins to prevent new infections with some expressing confusion and frustration.   The number of deaths from China's new coronavirus surged past 900 in mainland China on Monday after the hardest-hit province of Hubei reported 91 new fatalities. In its daily update, Hubei's health commission also confirmed another 2,618 new cases in the central province, where the outbreak emerged in December.

03 Feb 2020 01:40PM,China's death toll from coronavirus surpasses SARS,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: China's death toll from a new coronavirus jumped above 360 on Monday (Feb 3) to surpass the number of fatalities of its SARS crisis two decades ago, with dozens of people dying in the epicentre's quarantined ground-zero. The 57 confirmed new deaths was the single-biggest increase since the virus was detected late last year in the central city of Wuhan, where it is believed to have jumped from animals at a market into humans. The virus has since spread to more than 24 countries, despite many governments imposing unprecedented travel bans on people coming from China. The World Health Organisation has declared the crisis a global health emergency, and the first foreign death from the virus was reported in the Philippines on Sunday. In China, all but one of the 57 new deaths were reported Monday in Wuhan and the rest of Hubei province, most of which has been under lockdown for almost two weeks to stop people leaving and transmitting the virus. The national death toll reached 361, exceeding the 349 mainland fatalities from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002-03. SARS, caused by a pathogen similar to the new coronavirus and also originated in China, killed 774 people - with most of the other deaths in Hong Kong. ECONOMIC WOES The virus is also having an increasingly heavy economic impact, shutting down businesses across China, curbing international travel and impacting production lines of major international brands. Stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen plunged by nearly nine percent on Monday morning as investors returned from a Lunar New Year holiday that had been extended to stop people travelling around China. In Wuhan, which has been transformed from a bustling industrial hub into a near-ghost town, residents have been living in deep fear of catching the virus. Its medical facilities have been overwhelmed, and the government has been racing to build two new hospitals in extraordinarily quick timeframes. The first of those, a 1,000-bed facility, was due to open on Monday, just 10 days after construction began.  About 1,400 military medics will treat patients at the hospital, dubbed ""Fire God Mountain"", according to state media. However with the death toll surging in Wuhan and elsewhere in Hubei province, it was not immediately clear what overall impact the hospitals would have on the virus spreading elsewhere. In a worrying signal about it already spreading in significant numbers to other parts of China, the eastern industrial city of Wenzhou was on Sunday placed under a similar lockdown to Wuhan. Roads in Wenzhou, 800 kilometres to the east, were closed and its nine million people were ordered to stay indoors. Only one resident per household in Wenzhou is allowed to go out every two days to buy necessities, authorities announced.   TRAVEL CURBS The emergence of the virus coincided with the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions travel across the country in planes, trains and buses for family reunions. The holiday - originally scheduled to end last Friday - was extended by three days to give authorities more time to deal with the crisis. But some major cities - including Shanghai - extended the holiday again, and many schools and universities delayed the start of new terms. Road traffic on Sunday, when hundreds of millions of people would have been expected to return to their cities of work, was down 80 per cent, the transport ministry said. The number of infections in China also jumped signficantly on Monday, passing 17,200. The first person to die overseas from the virus was a 44-year-old man from Wuhan who travelled to the Philippines, the World Health Organization said. The G7 countries - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States - have all confirmed cases of the virus. They will discuss a joint response, Germany's health minister Jens Spahn said on Sunday. The US, Australia, New Zealand and Israel have banned foreign nationals from visiting if they have been in China recently, and they have also warned their own citizens against travelling there. Mongolia, Russia and Nepal have closed their land borders.

11 Feb 2020 10:31AM,"Singapore tourism to take 'significant hit' in 2020 due to coronavirus, up to 30% fewer visitors expected","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The tourism sector will take a “significant hit”, with visitor arrivals estimated to fall by 25 per cent to 30 per cent this year due to the novel coronavirus outbreak, said the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) on Tuesday (Feb 11). The coronavirus outbreak has significantly impacted visitor arrivals, especially from China, which accounts for about 20 per cent of international visitor arrivals here, said STB in a media release. There were about 3.6 million visitors from China in 2019. Compared to 2018, there was a 12 per cent increase in visitors from Tier 2 Chinese cities like Jinan, Ningbo and Xiamen, it added. China was also Singapore’s top revenue market in the first three quarters of 2019, accounting for S$3.2 billion in tourism receipts excluding the sightseeing, gaming and entertainment segments, up by 2 per cent from 2018. “Visitor arrivals from STB’s other key source markets are also expected to fall due to lower travel confidence globally,” said STB. Singapore is losing an average of 18,000 to 20,000 international visitors per day and most of the lost visitor arrivals are Chinese due to travel restrictions on both sides, STB chief executive Keith Tan told media on Tuesday. He noted that the estimated decrease in visitor arrivals could change depending on how long the situation in China lasts, how long the situation in Singapore and regional economies lasts, and how long it will take for traveller demand to return. He also added that the decline in tourism receipts would be ""roughly in line"" with the decline in visitor arrivals. “We believe that the situation this year will be at least as severe as the situation we faced in 2003 during SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), probably worse.” MORE RELIANT ON CHINA FOR TOURISM NOW Adding that Singapore is more reliant on China for tourism now compared to when the SARS outbreak hit in 2003, Mr Tan noted that China accounted for just 9 per cent of visitor arrivals that year. As a result, Singapore will probably take longer to recover from the novel coronavirus outbreak than the SARS outbreak in 2003, said Mr Tan. Singapore's tourism sector saw positive year-on-year results about seven to eight months after the World Health Organization declared Singapore SARS free, he added. However, after four years of consecutive growth, the tourism authorities said the sector is aiming for a strong recovery, with a pipeline of tourism investments and efforts to build new capabilities. “Our destination remains attractive, we have a strong pipeline of tourism products, and our market portfolio is diverse,” said Mr Tan. “The growth that we have enjoyed over the past four years reflects our strong tourism fundamentals,” he added. The Government will also form a public-private sector Tourism Recovery Action Task Force (TRAC) to lay out the plans for recovery and future growth, said STB. The Task Force will comprise tourism leaders from the public and private sectors, and it will work to identify opportunities arising from the coronavirus outbreak, boost confidence in Singapore’s tourism spots and create recovery plans. The statutory board had announced on Feb 2 that licence fees for hotels, travel agents and tour guides would be waived to help Singapore’s tourism sector, which has been “directly affected” by the coronavirus outbreak. STB will also defray the cleaning costs of hotels that provided accommodation to the confirmed and suspected cases of the coronavirus. Full details of the overall package of relief measures will be announced at Budget 2020 on Feb 18. TOURISM BUSINESSES AFFECTED Business and visitor numbers for Sentosa have fallen by 20 to 50 per cent, said Mr Quek Swee Kuan, chief executive of Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC). The island had seen a 17 to 19 per cent growth in local visitorship until the virus hit Singapore, he added. Adding that Sentosa plans to waive all admission fees for the March school holidays, he also said that attractions on the island are considering different options, for example, closing on certain days of the week. Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa and Village Hotel Sentosa, the hotels that saw two guests who later became Singapore’s first and fourth confirmed cases respectively, were impacted by the news at first, said Mr Quek. “But over time now, the situation has stabilised and generally the tourists have got confidence in Singapore and Sentosa hotels. And the hotels have been complying with the MOH (Ministry of Health) guidelines to ensure that the confidence in their product remains intact.” With visitor arrivals expected to drop, hotels will use the downtime to retrain workers and conduct renovations and repairs, said Ms Kwee Wei-Lin, president of the Singapore Hotel Association. ""Hotels are taking the time (to do so), because during 90 per cent occupancy we didn't have the ability to do so; so we're fast-forwarding a lot of these renovations,"" she said. ""We got support from the Government for that during SARS, and we are doing the same thing again."" When asked whether hotels have plans to lay off or retrench staff in light of the downturn, Ms Kwee noted that there were no layoffs during the SARS period and that the hotels hope to return with all their staff. As the coronavirus situation is expected to persist, the tourism board will continue to identify ""targeted and effective ways” to support the industry and its employees, it said. STB will also maintain its plans to enhance Singapore’s destination attractiveness, with work progressing on the Mandai Nature Precinct, the Jurong Lake District, the Sentosa-Brani masterplan, the rejuvenation of Orchard Road and the expansion of the Integrated Resorts. “It is more important than ever to invest in tourism to support our businesses, build confidence in tourism, and boost our destination attractiveness – so that when things start to improve, Singapore can ride on the recovery for strong growth,” said Mr Tan. “STB remains committed to our mid- to long-term tourism plans, to ensure that Singapore has a steady pipeline of new and repeat visitors.” VISITOR ARRIVALS, TOURISM RECEIPTS GREW IN 2019 Singapore saw growth in visitor arrivals and tourism receipts for a fourth consecutive year in 2019. Visitor arrivals rose 3.3 per cent to a total of 19.1 million visitors, and they spent a total of S$27.1 billion in tourism receipts, 0.5 per cent more than in 2018. After China, Indonesia and India accounted for the second and third-most number of visitors to Singapore, with about 3.1 million and 1.4 million visitors respectively. Singapore also saw a 13 per cent increase in visitors and a 14 per cent increase in tourism receipts from the United States. This could be attributed partly to greater flight connectivity between Singapore and the United States, with new non-stop flights launched in 2019. SECTORAL PERFORMANCE While the Business Travel and Meetings, Incentive Travel, Conventions and Exhibitions (BTMICE) sector fell 7 per cent year-on-year to S$3.2 billion, Singapore continues to attract leading BTMICE events, STB said. The hotel industry performed well in 2019, with growth registered across all categories. Total gazetted hotel room revenue stood at S$4.2 billion in 2019, as average room and occupancy rates rose. Cruise passenger throughput fell 2.5 per cent to reach 1.8 million passengers. This decline is largely attributed to the dry docking of Royal Caribbean International’s Voyager of the Seas in Singapore for over a month to undergo refurbishment works, the tourism board said. However, foreign cruise throughput grew by 3.5 per cent while ship calls rose 3.2 per cent to 414, with more European liners such as AIDA Cruises and Marella Cruises contributing to the growth. Demand for cruise remained strong in 2019, with Royal Caribbean International and Genting seeing healthy occupancy for their ships, STB said.

The toll was raised by 73 new deaths from the epidemic, the National Health Commission said in its daily update. Another 3,143 new cases of infection were confirmed, bringing total infections in the country thus far to 31,161, it said. The central province of Hubei where the virus originated continued to be hardest-hit, accounting for 69 of the new deaths reported in the 24 hours to Friday. Of the reported infections, more than 4,800 of those people were in serious condition. Chinese authorities are still struggling to contain the outbreak despite ordering millions of people indoors in a growing number of cities, with overwhelmed hospitals struggling to treat the surging numbers of ill. The contagion emerged in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan in December, later spreading to the rest of China and more than two dozen other countries, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a global emergency. The number of confirmed infections in China could still grow significantly, with the health commission saying that more than 26,000 other people were ""suspected"" of having contracted the virus.

07 Feb 2020 04:14PM,"Novel coronavirus: Malaysia confirms 1 more case, Wuhan woman was in Singapore with family","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia has confirmed one more case of the novel coronavirus, a Chinese tourist from Wuhan who entered the country from Singapore, Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad said in a press conference on Friday (Feb 7). The woman, 59, arrived in Singapore on Jan 17 and travelled to Johor Bahru on Jan 21. She was travelling with her husband, son and daughter-in-law, Dr Dzulkefly said. He added that the patient spent most of the time in her accommodation and developed a fever on Jan 26. “She did not seek treatment from any health facility and just took fever medicine bought by her son from a pharmacy nearby,” he added. The woman was due to return to China on Feb 4 via a flight from Johor Bahru to Guangzhou, but she did not travel as she was not feeling well. Her son and daughter-in-law left as scheduled. On Feb 5, she was still unwell and the Malaysian health authorities were informed by the management of the lodging property and transferred her to a hospital for treatment. ""She was tested positive for 2019-nCoV on Feb 6,"" Dr Dzulkefly said, adding that she is currently warded in Johor’s Permai Hospital and is in a stable condition. Her husband, 66, has also been isolated in the same hospital. He has not displayed any symptoms but samples have been taken for testing, Dr Dzulkefly added. On Thursday, Malaysia had confirmed its first locally transmitted case of the novel coronavirus, with the patient being the sister of the Malaysian man who attended a conference in Singapore and later tested positive for the virus. There are now 15 confirmed positive cases in Malaysia, of whom 11 are Chinese nationals and four are Malaysian citizens.

11 Feb 2020 09:22AM,Philippine airlines cancel flights to Taiwan over coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners MANILA: Philippine airlines have cancelled flights to Taiwan after the government expanded its travel ban to include all foreigners coming from the island to help contain the spread of the coronavirus. Philippine Airlines (PAL) and Cebu Pacific said they were cancelling flights to and from Taiwan to manage the risks from the fast-spreading virus outbreak. ""These restrictions are in relation to the coronavirus situation, in the interest of public health and safety,"" PAL spokeswoman Cielo Villaluna said in a statement. The Bureau of Immigration said late on Monday (Feb 10) that the travel ban will take effect immediately and will follow the same procedures as in the previously announced restriction that covered China, and its Special Administrative Regions Hong Kong and Macau. ""While not explicitly stated, we have confirmed ... that Taiwan is indeed part of the ban, and this expansion shall be implemented immediately,"" Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente said in a statement. Filipinos and foreigners with permanent resident visas may be allowed entry but will be turned over to the Bureau of Quarantine for assessment, Morente said. More than 115,000 Filipinos live and work in Taiwan, mainly in factories and as household helpers. Taiwan and China have close economic and cultural ties, and the island has reported 18 confirmed cases of the virus. China has reported more than 42,000 cases, by comparison, and over 1,000 deaths, centred on Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province. The World Health Organization has included Taiwan as part of China in its assessment that China is a ""high risk"" area for the virus, despite Taiwan's complaints that they have a totally separate government and health system and should not be included under China. This has already prompted Italy to include Taiwan as part of its flight ban from China, to Taiwan's anger.

04 Feb 2020 06:22AM,Commentary: We know more about the novel coronavirus but uncertainty remains about how virus spreads,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners The viral spread of anxiety and bigotry is as dangerous as the virus itself, says NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health’s Clarence Tam. SINGAPORE: In the past week, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the epidemic of the novel coronavirus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. This has previously been done for epidemics of swine (H1N1) influenza, polio, Zika and twice for epidemics of Ebola in west and central Africa. Classifying the current epidemic as an international emergency signifies the need for a concerted international effort to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. This decision has been precipitated by a number of factors, including the dramatic pace at which the epidemic is evolving, the detection of cases linked to international travel in an increasing number of countries, and the growing recognition of disease clusters outside of China that have resulted from person-to-person spread rather than travel to Hubei province. MANY KEY UNCERTAINTIES REMAIN But there is still uncertainty about some key issues – how widely the virus will spread outside China, what impact this will have, particularly in countries with fragile health systems, and exactly how severe this illness is. What we know so far is that the virus seems less deadly but more transmissible than SARS. Of the hospitalised cases detected in China, about 2 to 3 per cent have died compared to SARS’ 10 per cent fatality rate. Of these, most had underlying health conditions that are likely to have contributed to their risk of death. There is also increasing evidence that the virus can be passed on by people with mild or no symptoms. A new study by German researchers published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday (Jan 31) found a cluster of cases from China and Germany in which the virus appears to have spread before patients showed symptoms. All these cases were reported to have mild illness.   It is likely that a much larger pool of people have been infected but are not recorded in official statistics, because they do not experience pneumonia-like symptoms. One study published on prestigious medical journal The Lancet estimates than more than 75,800 have been infected in Wuhan alone, with the virus expected to reach its peak only in April or May. A more conservative estimate by China’s Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control estimates 25,000 infected but projects that the number of infections will double every six days. These uncertainties pose challenges for containing the epidemic, if people can pass on the virus to others before they know they are infected and before they can be isolated. For most healthy individuals, the risk of dying from a novel coronavirus infection is low, although we should be particularly concerned about those with pre-existing health conditions. Studies have shown that the first few cases saw a majority of those infected to be above 50. SARS had a fatality of 10 per cent but that jumped to 50 per cent in people over the age of 50, explained Vineet Menachery, an immunologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch said in an interview with Quartz, suggesting that seniors are more susceptible because of a weaker immune system. THE EXPLOSION OF CITIES MAY EXPLAIN JUMP FROM ANIMALS TO HUMANS As we work to resolve uncertainties about the biology of this new virus, it is important to remember epidemics have an important social dimension borne out of human development – which have little to do with peculiarities unique to China. Of the six epidemics that have been declared international emergencies, five involved viruses that ultimately originated in animals, including the current novel coronavirus.   Viruses routinely jump between species. In the past, these jumps were more likely to happen when humans and animals came into contact in remote areas. It was more difficult for these viruses to gain traction in humans, because there were fewer people to pass the virus on to. But as epidemics of SARS and Ebola have shown, with human migration and greater urbanisation, when these viruses are introduced into large, densely populated cities, they can spread rapidly and with devastating impact. This is bad news when there are about 600 cities with a population exceeding 1 million people today. But the astounding rise of China has seen urbanisation rates explode – 60 per cent of its population today live in urban areas and this figure is expected to rise to 70 per cent in the coming decade. Together with increased human encroachment into animal habitats and the intensification of food animal production, the emergence of animal viruses capable of causing similar international emergencies may become the new normal. The larger lesson to take away is this: If we are to successfully prevent and control the threat of such future epidemics, we urgently need global investments in urban planning, robust health systems and biosecurity. MEANWHILE BEWARE THE FEAR AND ANXIETY STOKED With the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus, we have also seen the viral spread of misinformation.   The upside of the potential for social media to facilitate rapid communication of scientific knowledge and health information emerging from this epidemic is being challenged by its use that fuels anxiety, fear and hatred. Conspiracy theories, malware, unfounded rumours and bigoted opinions have grown. Pictures of restaurant and store windows in South Korea and Japan with signs saying, “No Chinese allowed” have gone viral on Twitter and other social media platforms. Much of this incites social tension, distrust in governments, health authorities and scientific evidence, and demonstrates extreme and disturbing prejudices on the basis of nationality and ethnicity. As countries implement stricter travel restrictions and social distancing measures in an effort to curb epidemic spread, there is a real danger that as a society we may be aiding the spread of hatred and xenophobia. By the end of the epidemic, thousands of people will have been placed in isolation and quarantine and millions will have had their movements severely restricted through no fault of their own. The vast majority of these individuals will turn out to pose little or no threat to others, but are being asked or ordered to temporarily forfeit their freedoms for the good of the wider community. We should not look upon these individuals with fear, hatred and distrust, but rather with gratitude, kindness and compassion. In time, we will bring this epidemic under control and lessen its impact on humanity, but in doing so we must not lose sight of what it means to be human.

11 Feb 2020 03:59PM,"Symptoms of novel coronavirus mild, similar to all respiratory viruses in early stage: Expert","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Among 45 people who have been infected by the novel coronavirus here as of Monday (Feb 10), at least eight of them visited a doctor twice or thrice before testing positive for the virus at a hospital. One of them, one of the first four local transmissions, even did a chest X-ray in the emergency department at a hospital and was discharged after results came back negative for pneumonia. This is because in the first week of the disease, symptoms are so mild that they mirror those in all respiratory viruses, said executive director of the National Centre of Infectious Diseases (NCID) Leo Yee Sin. At this point, the clinical factors can be non-specific and very subtle, such as “a little bit unwell, a little bit of sore throat, a little bit of cough”, Prof Leo said on Monday. She was speaking on the sidelines of a conference that brought together scientists and researchers to share their work surrounding the virus. “These are very common manifestations of all the respiratory viruses that can cause acute respiratory illness. ""So just by these clinical indicators, we cannot tell whether it’s this coronavirus or (a) thousand and one different viruses out there that can cause acute respiratory illness,” she said.  DISEASE PROGRESSES IN SECOND WEEK The pattern of the disease so far is that it is mild to begin with, and therefore “very hard” to differentiate from other viruses, but that changes in the second week, she said. ""The disease tends to be very slow moving during the first week. At the end of the first week, in the second week, you can see a much faster pace of disease progression, and mostly the lung manifestation will appear around that period,” she said. This could be one reason why the number of critical cases is increasing, she added. “As the disease progresses, you will see more severe cases. Severe cases at this point of time are still very much a lung disease, pneumonia,” she said. As of Monday, Singapore has reported 45 cases of the coronavirus and seven patients are now in critical condition while seven have recovered and been discharged. Testing for the virus can currently only be done in hospitals.   WIDER CASE DEFINITION Health Minister Gan Kim Yong last week said that his ministry has expanded the case definition for the novel coronavirus. “We are now doing proactive case finding. This means never mind a connection to China. When they have pneumonia, I want to know if this is novel coronavirus. We are investigating more cases, so we are discovering more cases,” he said. When asked whether the definition of people who could potentially get infected was expanded too late, Dr Leo said: “As we know more about the disease transmission, we continue to tweak the case definition. Things are evolving, we are responding to the changes to make the system better.” In its latest circular to doctors on Feb 4 seen by CNA, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said among those who should be referred to hospital for further management are cases who have had frequent or close contact during work with recent travellers from mainland China within the past 14 days, if they also have an acute respiratory illness of any degree of severity. General practitioners CNA spoke to said that even if a patient has had a close contact with confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, it does not mean they will be automatically classified as a suspect. Doctors have to use their discretion. That would include too large a pool as it includes healthcare workers, and this would overwhelm the healthcare system, they said. When it comes to identifying potential novel coronavirus suspect cases, general practitioner Dr Elly Sabrina said there are some factors to take into account. ""I consider if the close contact to a suspect was wearing personal protective gear and whether he had repetitive contact in an enclosed space,"" she said. She added that the considerations are arbitrary and evolve daily. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Copyright© Mediacorp 2020. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

03 Feb 2020 11:45AM,"Novel coronavirus from Wuhan could transmit through human faeces, say scientists: Report","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners WUHAN: Scientists at China's top research body in natural sciences have found another possible mode of transmission of the novel coronavirus which originated in Wuhan. The virus, which has claimed the lives of more than 360 people in China, could be transmitted through the digestive system and into human faeces, according to scientists cited in a report by China's Xinhua news agency. This means that the virus could be ingested through the faecal-oral route, where pathogens can pass through faeces and into the mouth of another person. It may occur due to poor hygiene practices, lack of sanitation, pollution of soil and water bodies with faecal matter or contamination of food. Experts from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and the Wuhan Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences noticed that the initial symptom of some patients infected with the coronavirus was diarrhoea instead of fever, a more common symptom. The research team found viral nucleic acids in patients' stool and rectal swabs, and believes that the novel coronavirus has certain faecal-oral transmission possibilities, in addition to droplet and contact transmissions. China confirmed on Monday more than 17,000 cases of the coronavirus. The first coronavirus death outside China was reported on Sunday in the Philippines, a day after China imposed a lockdown on a major city far from the epicentre. Most of the infections overseas have been detected in people who travelled from Wuhan, an industrial hub of 11 million people, or surrounding areas of Hubei province. China has embarked on unprecedented efforts to contain the virus, which is believed to have come from a Wuhan animal market. Apart from China, human-to-human transmission has also been reported in South Korea, Japan, Germany and Thailand.

11 Feb 2020 06:15AM,‘Not enough manpower to get food to people in need’: Food charities hit as coronavirus measures ramped up,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Groups that help feed families in need have seen most volunteers drop out. And they worry about the impact of panic-buying on the flow of food donations. SINGAPORE: As some Singaporeans hunker down and stock up on food essentials in the face of the coronavirus outbreak, charities and volunteer groups are concerned about the impact on their ability to get supplies of food out to those relying on their help. Since the Government raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Friday, schools and companies have curtailed many activities, while anxious shoppers emptied the shelves at NTUC FairPrice outlets and wet markets. Some charity groups like Free Food For All (FFA), which provides free cooked meals and rations to low-income Singaporeans, are worried about what the stockpiling by consumers could mean for donations. “I see a potential hit on the amount of food donations we will receive,” said FFA’s founder Nizar Mohd Shariff. “We typically receive (from retailers) food that is not sold or near expiry – but if items are flying off the shelves, what’s left to be given to us?” The kind of mentality spurring the panic-buying is also worrying. “On normal days, people think, ‘I’ll donate if I have enough.’ But when people are hoarding stuff out of fear, donations would be the last thing on their mind.”   To discourage stockpiling, NTUC FairPrice has since placed limits on the purchase of high-demand items like rice, and reassured customers that it has ready stock of essential items. Food From The Heart’s (FFTH) chief executive Sim Bee Hia is concerned about how this might impact donations through its NTUC Shop & Donate scheme, where the public can order food staples to be delivered to a charity. This “has always been a steady source of food for us, especially rice”, said Ms Sim. SHARP DROP IN VOLUNTEERS But a far more urgent concern for the food assistance groups is the drying-up of their pool of volunteers in the past week or so. “There isn’t enough manpower to get food out to people in need,” said Ms Nichol Ng, co-founder of The Food Bank Singapore. People are forgetting that while this virus is going on, people in need still need to eat and life goes on. At FFTH, Ms Sim said she was “scrambling” to find volunteers to pack almost 2,000 food ration packs by the end of this week. A desperate call was put out on Facebook. “From Jan 31 till now, about 12 volunteer sessions with corporations and schools, who were supposed to help with the packing of food rations, were cancelled,” she said. “There were also individuals who signed up but were a no-show.”   The Food Bank Singapore relies on students to sort out and process public donations of canned food, biscuits and other groceries, or huge pallets of food from industry donors, before these can be redirected to beneficiaries. But since cases of the novel coronavirus began cropping up in Singapore, groups have been cancelling. “Our student volunteer pool has been wiped out,” said Ms Ng, adding that beneficiaries who have been getting rations from them twice a month “may only get it once a month”. The Food Bank also has a programme where companies, as part of a corporate responsibility programme for staff, can buy items that beneficiaries need, pack them, and go distributing door to door. “But now there’s none of that… The total food donation volume is down by 50 per cent,” said Ms Ng. For Willing Hearts, a cooked food charity that provides 6,500 free meals a day islandwide, the lack of manpower means it now takes longer to prepare and deliver food.   “Companies are telling employees to stay home, while school volunteers have completely disappeared in the last two weeks,” said Mr Teh Eng Hua, the president of Willing Hearts. But do or die, the charities that CNA Insider spoke to are doing all they can to get food to those who need it. They rely on their few staff and the odd volunteers who still turn up to help. The Food Bank is appealing to companies that can’t volunteer their time for now, to donate money instead so that it can buy the provisions needed to continue its service to beneficiaries. SPARE A THOUGHT FOR THEM FFTH is determined that its beneficiaries see no disruption to their food supply. “For the lower-income and vulnerable groups, seeing the empty supermarket shelves would have brought a sense of uneasiness because they are already struggling financially,” said Ms Sim. That’s why we need to honour our commitment. Food should be the last thing they are worried about. The good news is that those in need can turn to other sources of free food – like community fridges in Yishun stocked by donors and food rescuers, and FFTH’s The Community Shop @ Mountbatten just launched on Saturday.   While shoppers were packing supermarkets the day after DORSCON Orange was declared, Ms Sim said: “It was humbling to see that our beneficiaries were getting what they needed (at our free shop) without having to go through the frenzy at Sheng Shiong or NTUC FairPrice.” Indeed, the weekend’s binge-buying had charities appealing to Singaporeans to think of the impact of their actions on the low-income group. For instance, Ms Ng pointed out that those on assistance get NTUC FairPrice vouchers to buy groceries – and if the shelves were empty, they’d be forced to find the cash to buy elsewhere. She added: “We can’t stop people from panic buying. But if they really want to buy stuff, they could think of those in need and buy some for us as well,” Ms Sim took a lighter perspective. “I hope people realise that they bought too much,” she said with a laugh. “And then they’ll donate to us.” HOW YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE Food From The Heart: To volunteer, visit https://www.foodfromtheheart.sg or WhatsApp 81280432 Food Bank Singapore: To donate, visit https://www.giving.sg/the-food-bank-singapore-ltd Free Food For All: To donate or volunteer, visit https://freefood.org.sg National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre: To volunteer or donate to various COVID-19 charity efforts, visit https://www.giving.sg/sgunited TOUCH Community Services: To volunteer for Meals-On-Wheels delivery, call 68046565 Willing Hearts: To volunteer, visit http://www.willinghearts.org.sg It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

12 Feb 2020 06:02AM,"Commentary: When it comes to coronavirus, men are more vulnerable","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Sex differences in immune function appear to start right out of the womb, says an observer. LONDON: The details of the 99 coronavirus patients admitted to a Wuhan hospital were written up, as protocol demands, without fanfare. “The average age of the patients was 55.5 years, including 67 men and 32 women,” said a Lancet paper published last month, which reported 11 deaths. It is an eye-catching discrepancy. A picture is emerging of 2019-nCoV as a novel pathogen that disproportionately affects older men, particularly those with existing illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes. A similar pattern can be found in the statistics on SARS, which caused about 780 deaths nearly two decades ago. Some scientists are now convinced that these sex differences in clinical data reflect a genuine male vulnerability to coronaviruses, rather than a bias in exposure. The observations add to growing evidence that, immunologically speaking, men are the weaker sex. GENDER MATTERS The new coronavirus is most often compared with SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which originated on the Arabian peninsula in 2012. SARS had an overall death rate of about 10 per cent, while MERS killed about a third of those infected. The figure for 2019-nCoV seems to be about 3 to 4 per cent (that might fall as milder cases turn up). Drilling down into the data, though, reveals that gender matters. One analysis of about 1,800 SARS patients showed a death rate for men of 22 per cent, compared with 13 per cent for women. A 2019 study of 229 MERS patients showed it killed 32 per cent of men compared with 26 per cent of women.   Possible reasons for disparities include smoking, variation in hospital treatment, and gender-linked immune response. That last possibility preoccupies Stanley Perlman, an immunologist at the University of Iowa, who has studied how SARS progresses in male and female mice. Middle-aged male mice fared particularly poorly. The sex differences, he said, “seem to be consistent across coronaviruses. The effects are greater in mice than humans, I think, but there is always a male gender predominance.” He and colleagues suggest hormones – specifically oestrogen – might be key. And the size of the Wuhan outbreak, he suggests, could allow oestrogen’s role in disease defence to be teased out. OUT OF THE WOMB Sex differences in immune function appear to start right out of the womb. Baby girls are more likely to reach their first birthday than male newborns, according to the World Health Organization. Globally, women outlive men by an average of six to eight years. The WHO credits female longevity to an “inherent biological advantage”, as well as to healthier behaviour. Females are also more prone to autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, in which the body attacks itself. This might be because women carry two X chromosomes (the X chromosome contains immunity-related genes, among others).   From an evolutionary point of view, an easily triggered immune response might be connected to childbearing; one theory is that while some parts of the female immune system are dialled down to avoid rejecting the foetus, other parts step up to compensate. Given that modern women spend less time pregnant than their forebears did, this selectively exaggerated response might explain the high female levels of autoimmune diseases. That same overactive response might mean women clear the new coronavirus more quickly than men. There is no upside to the current outbreak; a new chain of transmission has begun in Europe after a suspected “superspreader” travelled from a Singapore conference to a French ski resort, infecting others. Still, rapidly growing patient numbers might yet reveal the secrets of female resistance. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Copyright© Mediacorp 2020. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

05 Feb 2020 03:06PM,More Chinese cities shut down as novel coronavirus death toll rises,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners HANGZHOU: Millions more people have been ordered to stay indoors as China battles to curb the spread of a new virus that authorities said on Wednesday (Feb 5) has already killed nearly 500 people. With more than 24,000 cases in China, a growing number of cities have been imposing a range of restrictions in recent days far from central Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, as authorities struggle to contain the virus. Global concerns have risen as more countries found cases that were not imported from China and 10 people tested positive for the virus on a ship quarantined off the coast of Japan. Some 56 million people in Hubei have been under virtual lockdown since last week, with its capital Wuhan at the heart of the health emergency. In Hangzhou, about 175km southwest of Shanghai, green fences blocked streets near the headquarters of Chinese tech giant Alibaba as a fighter jet circled overhead. Alibaba, one of the world's most valuable companies, appeared shut down, while deliverymen moved in and out of the nearby fenced-in residential areas to drop off groceries. Many people were also seen going out. The firm is inside one of three districts where about 3 million people were told this week that only one person per household would be allowed outside every two days to buy necessities.   ""Please don't go out, don't go out, don't go out!"" blared a message on a loudspeaker urging people to wear masks, wash their hands regularly and report any people who are from Hubei - a common fear in other parts of the country that people from the province might infect others. At least three other cities in eastern Zhejiang province - Taizhou, Wenzhou and parts of Ningbo - have imposed the same measures, affecting about 18 million people. Similar policies were encouraged by authorities in two cities as far as China's northeasternmost province, Heilongjiang, and a handful of others along the east coast. In Henan province, which borders Hubei, a district in the city of Zhumadian decided that only one person could leave each household every five days. Residents there have been offered cash rewards for informing on people from Hubei. GLOBAL JITTERS The disease is believed to have emerged in December in a Wuhan market that sold wild animals, and spread rapidly as people travelled for the Lunar New Year holiday in January. The death toll has steadily increased, rising to 490 in China after Hubei reported 65 more people had died.   Most deaths have been in the province and officials have noted that the death rate, at around 2 per cent, is below the mortality rate of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. The new coronavirus is from the same family of pathogens as the one that causes SARS, which killed some 800 people in 2002-2003.  The epidemic has prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a global health emergency, several governments to institute travel restrictions, and airlines to suspend flights to and from China. United and American Airlines said Wednesday they have added Hong Kong to their China flight suspensions. On Wednesday Japan said at least 10 passengers on a cruise ship carrying 3,711 people have the virus. Japanese authorities began testing those on board after a former passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the illness. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Tuesday advised Britons to leave China ""if they can"", to minimise their risk of exposure to the virus. 'WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY' But the WHO said Tuesday that dramatic measures taken by China offered a chance to halt transmission. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the great majority of cases are in China. ""That doesn't mean that it won't get worse. But for sure we have a window of opportunity to act,"" he said. Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand all reported new infections not imported from China on Tuesday. Two fatalities have been reported outside the mainland, in Hong Kong and the Philippines. Semi-autonomous Hong Kong has closed all but two land crossings with the Chinese mainland. As countries battle to keep the virus off their shores, the WHO chief accused wealthy countries of falling short on their duties in sharing data. ""Of the 176 cases reported outside China so far, WHO has received complete case report forms for only 38 percent,"" he said.

03 Feb 2020 03:25PM,Singapore preparing various contingencies as outbreak of novel coronavirus evolves: Gan Kim Yong,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore is preparing for various scenarios of how the global outbreak of a novel coronavirus could evolve, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong in Parliament on Monday (Feb 3) as he warned of risks ahead and the need to “plan for the worst”. “There could be a long road ahead,” he said in a ministerial statement delivered in response to six parliamentary questions filed about the latest virus outbreak, which first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan last December and has since spread to 23 countries around the world. He referred to how it took about eight months from the first detected case of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) before the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it to be contained in July 2003. How the current virus outbreak would turn out is unsure, Mr Gan said. “Therefore, we must stand ready to respond to new developments as the situation evolves.”  First, he said there could be community spread in more Chinese cities beyond Wuhan or in other countries. If this happens, there may be a need to roll out additional measures to prevent the importation and to contain the virus, said the minister, who described this as not an easy decision to make. “We have to do what is necessary to protect the health and safety of our people and those who travel to Singapore,” he added. The second scenario, according to Mr Gan, is local community spread. “Despite our best efforts, this is a possibility that we must be ready for,” he said, while adding that the key to managing this is quick detection and limiting further spread, which calls on social responsibility from all Singaporeans. “If the infected Singaporean wears a mask to protect others, and promptly sees a doctor and gets triaged for testing, the risk of further spread could be greatly reduced. Even if there is spread, quick action will help to limit its extent,” Mr Gan elaborated. Once tested positive, the Government can also contact trace quickly, helping to reduce further spread to their close contacts, he added. “If the community spread becomes very extensive, we will need to consider measures to reduce human to human interactions, such as cancelling mass gatherings, suspending schools, paring down non-essential care services and introducing further infection control and monitoring measures, to slow the spread,” said the minister. In the third scenario, the virus could mutate to become more infectious and spread widely, resulting in a pandemic. “This is the known unknown, and we have to assess what best to do, depending on how the virus mutates,” he told Parliament. For example, the virus may also become less infectious or less severe. On the healthcare front, Mr Gan, who also co-chairs a multi-ministerial task force to direct the Government’s response to the new infectious virus, said Singapore is stepping up preparations for these potential scenarios. This includes increasing the capacity of isolation beds by around 100 in the past two weeks. Singapore has also been increasing its testing capacity to more quickly confirm suspect cases. “Overall, we must stay calm but cautious. Our early intervention efforts have helped to contain the spread so far, but while we hope for the best, we must plan for the worst,” he said.  In a wide-ranging speech, Mr Gan also shared what is known about the novel coronavirus thus far, such as how it is most likely transmitted via droplets from an infected person and individuals can best protect themselves by practicing good hygiene. The medical consensus at the moment is that the novel coronavirus is “more transmissible but appears less deadly than SARS”, he said, adding that available evidence also suggests a possible higher rate of human-to-human transmission than that of SARS. He clarified that there is no evidence currently to suggest the virus is airborne. Nor is there a known curative treatment. The development of a successful cure may take time, months or years, he added. The current approach is to provide good supportive care for the patients to reduce complications and to allow time for the patient to recover, he said. Mr Gan also said that the current case fatality rate stands at around 2 to 3 per cent, with majority of the deaths among those with underlying medical conditions. This is lower than the fatality rate of SARS, which was around 10 per cent. But this remains the initial stages of the outbreak, added the minister, noting that the actual severity “can only be assessed after some time”. The Government has been following the situation in Wuhan closely since last December and responded rapidly with a series of measures to reduce the risk of import and spread of the virus since early January. These include the implementation of temperature screening at the airport and the set-up of a multi-ministerial task force on Jan 22 as the confirmed cases in Wuhan increased significantly. As the global and local situation evolves, the task force has since stepped up measures accordingly, such as a widening of travel restrictions to bar all new visitors of any nationality with recent travel history to China from entering Singapore and the suspension of new visas to those with Chinese passports. There is also good surveillance systems in place to help identify cases, said Mr Gan, citing healthcare providers, especially polyclinics and GPs, that are on heightened alert and stand ready to deal with cases as they emerge. Individuals also have a part to play by exercising social responsibility to prevent or stem any possible spread of the virus in the community. Mr Gan said: “We had set up multiple lines of defence to reduce the risk of imported cases and local community transmission. We have been stepping up our posture and efforts at each line of defence.” On their own, none of these measures are fool-proof, he added. “But when taken together, they will improve our resilience and ability to respond to this disease.” In an update on the current situation in Singapore, Mr Gan said the number of confirmed cases here has remained at 18. All of the confirmed cases are being treated in isolation rooms and the conditions of most of these confirmed cases are improving, he said. Meanwhile, as of Sunday noon, 43 recently admitted suspect cases are pending test results, while 240 suspect cases were tested and cleared. “To date, there is no evidence of local community transmission. However, we should not be complacent and we must be prepared for this scenario,” said the Health Minister. GOVERNMENT WILL ACT SWIFTLY: GAN Noting that Singaporeans may feel anxious given the many unknowns about the novel coronavirus, Mr Gan said: “Here, I want to reiterate the Government’s firm commitment that we will spare no efforts in protecting our people. “We will act swiftly and share information on the novel coronavirus openly and as soon as possible,” he added. “We have overcome several challenges as a nation in the past, such as SARS, H1N1, and Zika. In the face of this novel coronavirus, we have built up our defences, our capabilities, and we are stronger and more prepared."" Describing the need for a ""whole-of-Singapore"" response, Mr Gan added: “This is a fight that calls on every individual to do our part. We are confident that we can manage and overcome this situation as a nation, and emerge stronger together."" Mr Gan, in his speech, also acknowledged the healthcare workers on the frontlines and commended them for their bravery and selflessness. ""They have worked tirelessly over the past few weeks, missing their holidays or reunion dinners. They worked very hard so as to keep Singapore and Singaporeans safe,"" he said. He also noted that the outbreak of the novel coronavirus is not just a problem for China, but for the world. As such, Singapore will be putting together an assistance package to help the communities in China severely affected by the novel coronavirus, with more details to be provided later.

07 Feb 2020 08:52AM,Another 41 on cruise liner off Japan have new coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TOKYO: Another 41 people on board a cruise liner off Japan's coast have tested positive for the new strain of coronavirus, Japan's health minister said on Thursday (Feb 6). The new cases raise the number of confirmed infections on the Diamond Princess to at least 61, said Katsunobu Kato. Japanese authorities have tested 273 people on board the ship, which was quarantined after a former passenger, who disembarked in Hong Kong last month, tested positive for the virus. ""The results of the remaining 171 tests came out and 41 tested positive,"" Kato told reporters. ""Today they will be sent to hospitals in several prefectures, and we are now preparing for that. ""In total, out of 273 specimens, 61 tested positive,"" he added. There are more than 3,700 passengers and crew on the ship, which has been off Japan's coast since Monday evening. It docked in Yokohama on Thursday to resupply for a quarantine that could last until Feb 19. Twenty people who were earlier diagnosed with the virus have already been removed from the vessel and taken to hospitals. Testing was initially carried out on those who displayed symptoms or had come into contact with the former passenger diagnosed with the virus. But Kato suggested additional testing would now take place. Authorities will ""test those who are susceptible to illness, including elderly people and those with other ailments, as well as those who had close contact with the people newly diagnosed with the virus"", he said. There were no immediate details on how many people would meet those criteria or when the testing might take place. ""I WANT TO CRY"" Japan has already reported at least 25 cases of coronavirus aside from the infections on board the ship, and evacuated hundreds of citizens from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus emerged. A fourth evacuation flight carrying both Japanese citizens and non-Japanese spouses and those with other ties to the country arrived on Friday morning. Japanese authorities have said the ship's quarantine may last until Feb 19, with passengers required to stay inside their cabins in a bid to prevent new infections. Those on board have described their confusion and frustration as their luxury cruise descends into a nightmare. ""Just woke up from (a) sleepless night,"" wrote Yardley Wong, a Twitter user on board the ship.""Getting so emotional... I want to cry. ""David Abel, a British passenger who has been posting videos from the ship, said people were hearing information from media more quickly than authorities on board. ""It's not right. It's so unfair,"" he said. But he praised the efforts of crew members who are now struggling to deliver meals to thousands of passengers in their cabins. Those with inside cabins, which have no windows, have been allowed onto decks in small groups to get fresh air, but under strict conditions, including wearing a mask at all times when out of their rooms. ""The quarantine officials require that you avoid congregating in large groups and maintain a separation of at least one metre from each other when talking,"" the ship's captain said in an announcement on Friday morning. ""We require that you wear as a minimum, warm clothing, hat and a scarf if possible,"" he added. A second cruise ship carrying a passenger suspected of infection with coronavirus will not be allowed to dock in southern Japan, the government said Friday.

31 Jan 2020 10:26AM,Japan speeds up new Wuhan coronavirus measures as more evacuees arrive,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TOKYO: Japan said on Friday (Jan 31) that it would bring forward the date that the coronavirus will become a ""designated infectious disease"" to Saturday from Feb 7, as a third chartered flight carrying Japanese citizens arrived from Wuhan. The measures were due to come into effect from Feb 7, but will now be moved up to Feb 1, Shinzo Abe told parliament. ""With this measure, we will refuse infected individuals entry to Japan,"" Abe said. ""We will swiftly study ways to strengthen immigration control for cases where infection is suspected but not confirmed,"" he added. Japan now has 14 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, an epidemic that is believed to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Two of those returned on the first chartered flight and had shown no symptoms. As worries grew in Japan over a further spread of the disease, the government said it would refuse entry to anyone infected and consider stricter screening for suspected cases, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said. Suga also told a news conference that the government would consider paying for the chartered flights out of Wuhan, as opposition lawmakers criticised its policy of charging passengers 80,000 yen (US$730) each. ""We decided on these changes in view of the World Health Organization's (WHO) declaration of a global emergency,"" Suga said. The government classified the new coronavirus as a designated infectious disease on Tuesday, but the designation was only set to take effect on Feb 7 after ordinances are issued, in line with regulations. The designation allows compulsory hospitalisation and the use of public funds for treatment, among other measures. The third flight out of Wuhan, which arrived on Friday morning, brings the total number of expatriated nationals to 565, Suga said. Unlike other countries, which are opting to isolate returning citizens for between 72 hours and two weeks, Japan has asked evacuees to ""self-quarantine"". Japanese officials say there is no legal basis for them to forcibly isolate people who have not tested positive for the virus - and that will not change with the implementation of the new rules from Saturday. There was also outrage after it emerged that two people on the first evacuation flight from Wuhan initially refused to be tested for the virus, and were allowed to return home after being advised to avoid public transport and monitor their health. The government has said it cannot force people to take the test, and on Thursday night health ministry officials said the two individuals had now changed their minds and would take the test. Of the 206 people who arrived on a first flight on Wednesday, 12 have been hospitalised, with all but two of the other passengers staying at a government-designated hotel in Chiba outside Tokyo. A second evacuation flight carrying 210 people arrived on Thursday, with 26 passengers hospitalised after checks on board and at a health facility after landing. The remaining passengers are staying at government-designated accommodation, and all the passengers on the second flight were tested for the new virus, officials said.

04 Feb 2020 06:22AM,Commentary: We know more about the novel coronavirus but uncertainty remains about how virus spreads,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners The viral spread of anxiety and bigotry is as dangerous as the virus itself, says NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health’s Clarence Tam. SINGAPORE: In the past week, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the epidemic of the novel coronavirus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. This has previously been done for epidemics of swine (H1N1) influenza, polio, Zika and twice for epidemics of Ebola in west and central Africa. Classifying the current epidemic as an international emergency signifies the need for a concerted international effort to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. This decision has been precipitated by a number of factors, including the dramatic pace at which the epidemic is evolving, the detection of cases linked to international travel in an increasing number of countries, and the growing recognition of disease clusters outside of China that have resulted from person-to-person spread rather than travel to Hubei province. MANY KEY UNCERTAINTIES REMAIN But there is still uncertainty about some key issues – how widely the virus will spread outside China, what impact this will have, particularly in countries with fragile health systems, and exactly how severe this illness is. What we know so far is that the virus seems less deadly but more transmissible than SARS. Of the hospitalised cases detected in China, about 2 to 3 per cent have died compared to SARS’ 10 per cent fatality rate. Of these, most had underlying health conditions that are likely to have contributed to their risk of death. There is also increasing evidence that the virus can be passed on by people with mild or no symptoms. A new study by German researchers published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday (Jan 31) found a cluster of cases from China and Germany in which the virus appears to have spread before patients showed symptoms. All these cases were reported to have mild illness.   It is likely that a much larger pool of people have been infected but are not recorded in official statistics, because they do not experience pneumonia-like symptoms. One study published on prestigious medical journal The Lancet estimates than more than 75,800 have been infected in Wuhan alone, with the virus expected to reach its peak only in April or May. A more conservative estimate by China’s Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control estimates 25,000 infected but projects that the number of infections will double every six days. These uncertainties pose challenges for containing the epidemic, if people can pass on the virus to others before they know they are infected and before they can be isolated. For most healthy individuals, the risk of dying from a novel coronavirus infection is low, although we should be particularly concerned about those with pre-existing health conditions. Studies have shown that the first few cases saw a majority of those infected to be above 50. SARS had a fatality of 10 per cent but that jumped to 50 per cent in people over the age of 50, explained Vineet Menachery, an immunologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch said in an interview with Quartz, suggesting that seniors are more susceptible because of a weaker immune system. THE EXPLOSION OF CITIES MAY EXPLAIN JUMP FROM ANIMALS TO HUMANS As we work to resolve uncertainties about the biology of this new virus, it is important to remember epidemics have an important social dimension borne out of human development – which have little to do with peculiarities unique to China. Of the six epidemics that have been declared international emergencies, five involved viruses that ultimately originated in animals, including the current novel coronavirus.   Viruses routinely jump between species. In the past, these jumps were more likely to happen when humans and animals came into contact in remote areas. It was more difficult for these viruses to gain traction in humans, because there were fewer people to pass the virus on to. But as epidemics of SARS and Ebola have shown, with human migration and greater urbanisation, when these viruses are introduced into large, densely populated cities, they can spread rapidly and with devastating impact. This is bad news when there are about 600 cities with a population exceeding 1 million people today. But the astounding rise of China has seen urbanisation rates explode – 60 per cent of its population today live in urban areas and this figure is expected to rise to 70 per cent in the coming decade. Together with increased human encroachment into animal habitats and the intensification of food animal production, the emergence of animal viruses capable of causing similar international emergencies may become the new normal. The larger lesson to take away is this: If we are to successfully prevent and control the threat of such future epidemics, we urgently need global investments in urban planning, robust health systems and biosecurity. MEANWHILE BEWARE THE FEAR AND ANXIETY STOKED With the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus, we have also seen the viral spread of misinformation.   The upside of the potential for social media to facilitate rapid communication of scientific knowledge and health information emerging from this epidemic is being challenged by its use that fuels anxiety, fear and hatred. Conspiracy theories, malware, unfounded rumours and bigoted opinions have grown. Pictures of restaurant and store windows in South Korea and Japan with signs saying, “No Chinese allowed” have gone viral on Twitter and other social media platforms. Much of this incites social tension, distrust in governments, health authorities and scientific evidence, and demonstrates extreme and disturbing prejudices on the basis of nationality and ethnicity. As countries implement stricter travel restrictions and social distancing measures in an effort to curb epidemic spread, there is a real danger that as a society we may be aiding the spread of hatred and xenophobia. By the end of the epidemic, thousands of people will have been placed in isolation and quarantine and millions will have had their movements severely restricted through no fault of their own. The vast majority of these individuals will turn out to pose little or no threat to others, but are being asked or ordered to temporarily forfeit their freedoms for the good of the wider community. We should not look upon these individuals with fear, hatred and distrust, but rather with gratitude, kindness and compassion. In time, we will bring this epidemic under control and lessen its impact on humanity, but in doing so we must not lose sight of what it means to be human.

13 Feb 2020 02:15PM,"Vietnam quarantines commune of 10,000 over coronavirus","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners VINH PHUC: Villages in Vietnam with 10,000 people close to the nation's capital were placed under quarantine on Thursday (Feb 13) after six cases of the deadly new coronavirus were discovered there, authorities said. The locking down of the commune of Son Loi, about 40km from Hanoi, is the first mass quarantine outside of China since the virus emerged from a central Chinese city late last year. ""As of Feb 13, 2020, we will urgently implement the task of isolation and quarantine of the epidemic area in Son Loi commune,"" said a health ministry statement. ""The timeline... is for 20 days"". Son Loi is a farming region made up of several villages. The health ministry previously said five people in Son Loi had been infected with the virus, and on Thursday reported a sixth case. On Thursday, checkpoints were set up around the commune, according to AFP reporters in Binh Xuyen, a district on the outskirts of Son Loi.  Health officials wearing protective suits sprayed disinfectant on vehicles by the checkpoints. Villager Tran Van Minh told AFP that authorities had already advised residents to avoid large gatherings. ""Life has been badly affected,"" he told AFP by phone, adding that much of the labour force is reliant on jobs in construction and house painting. ""Now we cannot get out and even if we do, clients don't welcome us that much as before."" More than 1,350 people have died in China from the virus, and nearly 60,000 others have been infected, since it was first detected in the Hubei province in early January. China has imposed unprecedented quarantines across Hubei, locking in about 56 million people, in a bid to stop it spreading. Tens of millions of others cities far from the epicentre are also enduring travel restrictions. The virus has also had massive ramifications globally, with many countries banning travellers from China in a bid to stop people spreading the disease. Vietnam, which shares a porous border with China, has 16 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, including those in Son Loi. Vietnam had banned all flights to and from mainland China in a bid to stop the virus from spreading. It also suspended new tourist visas for Chinese nationals or foreigners who had been in China over the past two weeks.

09 Feb 2020 12:47PM,What we know about the 3 local transmission clusters of coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The authorities have named three clusters of locally transmitted coronavirus cases in Singapore, including a possible cluster associated with The Life Church and Missions Singapore. The other two clusters are linked to health products shop Yong Thai Hang in Cavan Road and a private business meeting held at Grand Hyatt Singapore respectively. Together, the clusters involve at least 17 people including three families. Investigations on these clusters are ongoing, according to a daily update from the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Sunday (Feb 9) night, which also said that the total number of people infected here has grown to 43. Authorities on Friday raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange, following several confirmed cases without any links to previous cases or travel history to China. In its latest update, MOH also said that contact tracing is underway for seven locally transmitted cases unrelated to the clusters. Here’s what we know about the clusters so far: CLUSTER 1 WHERE: The Life Church and Missions Singapore at 146B Paya Lebar Road WHO: 5 people, comprising a married couple from Wuhan (cases 8 and 9) and three Singaporeans (cases 31, 33 and 38) who had visited the church DETAILS: MOH announced on Feb 8 that cases 8, 9 and 33 had links to the church, following further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing. They include the married couple – both 56-year-old Chinese nationals from Wuhan – who arrived in Singapore together on Jan 19. They did not show symptoms during their flight to Singapore. They only developed symptoms on Jan 24 and took a taxi to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) three days later. They tested positive on Jan 28 and 29 and remain warded in isolation rooms at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). Before that, the couple had stayed with their family at their home at Lorong Lew Lian in Upper Serangoon. The third is a 39-year-old Singaporean woman who did not have recent travel history to China, but had been in Malaysia Jan 22 to 29. She developed symptoms on Jan 30 and went to the emergency department at the Sengkang General Hospital (SKH) on Feb 2 and was admitted. Test results confirmed the infection on Feb 6. She is currently warded in isolation at SKH. The other two Singaporeans – cases 31 and 38 – also have no recent travel history to China. But prior to hospital admission, both had been to The Life Church and Missions Singapore. The former is a 53 year-old Singaporean man who reported symptoms on Jan 23 and visited a general practitioner (GP) on the same day. He then visited another clinic on Jan 28 and was admitted to the Changi General Hospital on Feb 1. Before that, the man, who stays at Tampines Street 24, had been to Malaysia on Jan 6, 11 and 17, as well as visited family and friends during Chinese New Year. He was confirmed positive for the virus on Feb 6. The 38th confirmed case is a 52-year-old Singaporean woman who reported symptoms on Feb 3 and visited the Choa Chu Kang Polyclinic the next day. She was admitted to NCID on Feb 7 and tested positive for the infection a day later. Apart from the church, she had also visited Marina Bay Sands, Chinatown and Plaza Singapura and had travelled by public transport.   CLUSTER 2 WHERE: Yong Thai Hang at 24 Cavan Road, where a tour group from Guangxi, China, had visited last month. Two travellers in the Chinese tour group have tested positive for the virus, MOH said on Feb 5 citing confirmation from Chinese health authorities. WHO: Nine people including a family of three (cases 19, 27 and 28) and their foreign domestic helper (case 21). Three others (cases 20, 34 and 40) are employees of the shop, while the remaining two (cases 24 and 25) are a tour guide and her husband. All nine did not recently travel to China. DETAILS: This was the first local transmission cluster announced by authorities on Feb 4 after some of the infected people had “prolonged interactions” with the travellers from China. One of them, case 19, is a 28-year-old female Singapore resident who works as a salesperson at Yong Thai Hang and reported having a sore throat and fever on Jan 29. She sought treatment at a GP clinic on the same day. The next day, she went to TTSH’s emergency department and was discharged after a chest X-ray came back negative for pneumonia. She did not leave her home at Jalan Bukit Merah from Jan 31 to Feb 2. On Feb 3, she was admitted to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and tested positive for the novel coronavirus on the same day. She is currently warded in an isolation room at SGH.   Her husband and son – cases 27 and 28 – were announced to have come down with the novel coronavirus on Feb 5. The former, a 45-year-old Singaporean, had developed symptoms on Feb 1. He visited a GP the next day and was subsequently isolated at the NCID on Feb 4. He remains warded at the NCID. Prior to hospital admission, he stayed at his home at Jalan Bukit Merah and worked as a private hire driver. He also visited Tiong Bahru Plaza, Tiong Bahru Market and Beo Crescent Market and Food Centre. The couple’s six-month-old baby boy is now in an isolation room at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. Prior to hospital admission, he was not in any infant care facility and was cared for at home, MOH said. The family’s foreign domestic helper was the 21st confirmed case. The 44-year-old Indonesian woman reported onset of symptoms on Feb 2 and did not leave her place of residence at Jalan Bukit Merah. She was admitted to SGH on Feb 3 and tested positive the next day. Three employees at the shop have also come down with the virus and are currently warded in isolation rooms at the NCID. One, case 20, is a 48-year-old female Singapore resident who reported symptoms on Jan 25 and was tested positive on Feb 4. She had gone to NCID on Feb 3 and was immediately isolated “given that she is a colleague of Case 19”, according to MOH’s media release on Feb 4. The other two – cases 34 and 40 – are a 40-year-old Singaporean woman and a 36-year-old Singaporean man. Both employees had been identified as close contacts of cases 19 and 20, and were placed under home quarantine on Feb 4. The former, who stays at Sin Ming Road, had reported symptoms on Jan 27 and visited two GP clinics on Jan 27 and Feb 1. She was admitted to NCID two days after being placed under home quarantine, and tested positive for the coronavirus on Feb 7. The man, who stays at Bedok North Street, developed symptoms on Jan 30 and visited a GP on the same day. He was admitted to NCID on Feb 7 and confirmed as an infected case on Feb 8. A 32-year-old Singaporean woman who works as a tour guide and has brought groups of tourists to Yong Thai Hang, was the 24th confirmed case. She had gone to NCID on Feb 3 with no symptoms – although she subsequently informed NCID on Feb 4 night that she had developed a fever on Jan 30, according to MOH – and was confirmed positive on Feb 4 at about 2pm. Prior to admission to NCID, the tour guide stayed at her home at Buangkok Green and worked at Jalan Besar. She had visited Hougang Polyclinic on Jan 30 and went to a supermarket near her home. Her husband also tested positive on Feb 4. The 40-year-old Singaporean had developed a fever on Jan 24. He visited the same polyclinic as his wife on Jan 30 and self-presented at NCID four days later where he was immediately isolated. Prior to being admitted, the man had stayed at home. He worked at Diamond Industries Jewellery Company at Harbour Drive, which the tour group from China had visited as well. Both are currently warded in isolation rooms at NCID.   CLUSTER 3 WHERE: A business conference held by Servomex, a gas analysis company founded in the UK with offices worldwide.The event was held at the Grand Hyatt Singapore from Jan 20 to 22 and included participants from China, including Hubei province. Confirmed cases from Malaysia, South Korea and Britain have also been linked to this meeting.   WHO: Three people – a 27-year-old Singaporean man (case 30), 38 year-old female Singapore Permanent Resident (case 36) and a 51 year-old Singaporean man (case 39) – who are currently warded in isolation rooms at NCID. All three do not have recent travel history to China, but two of them were in Malaysia between Jan 23 and Feb 2. DETAILS: The first Singaporean case with links to the meeting at the Grand Hyatt is a 27-year-old who reported onset of fever on Jan 21. He visited a GP a week later and sought treatment at another GP clinic on Feb 3. He was admitted to NCID on Feb 6 and confirmed as infected with the virus the same day, making him the country’s 30th confirmed case. Before being admitted, the man, who stays at Shunfu Road, had been to Far East Square and Junction 8. The 38 year-old woman – case 36 – reported symptoms on Jan 24 and visited a GP on Feb 1. She was isolated and admitted to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital on Feb 4 and was confirmed as infected three days later. Apart from attending the business meeting at Grand Hyatt, the woman, who stays at Bukit Batok Street 31, had also visited a family member at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital prior to hospital admission. The third Singaporean individual with links to this cluster is a 51 year-old Singaporean man who reported symptoms on Jan 29. He visited two GP clinics on Feb 3 and 5, respectively, before being admitted to NCID on Feb 6. Subsequent tests confirmed the man, who stays at Jurong West Central, as being down with the virus on Feb 8.

07 Feb 2020 03:55PM,"Firms must keep transforming even as they brace for hit from coronavirus, says Enterprise Singapore","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The outbreak of a novel coronavirus has thrown up new uncertainties for businesses in Singapore, which already have to cope with a sharp slowdown in the domestic economy last year and global risks such as the US-China trade war. Enterprise Singapore (ESG) said its “immediate priority is to assist companies” in coping with the impact of the new virus, such as lower demand, supply chain disruptions and travel restrictions. But its representatives, who were speaking at the release of the agency’s year-in-review report on Friday (Feb 7), stressed that companies, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), must continue with transformation efforts to remain competitive in the long run. BUSINESS CONTINUITY TOP CONCERN AMID VIRUS SPREAD CEO Png Cheong Boon said business continuity is currently top on the minds of businesses, as they figure out plans to tackle the impact of the unknown flu-like virus that has spread beyond China to other parts of the world. Singapore has 30 confirmed cases of the coronavirus as of Thursday. “Cash flow is a key concern and we encourage businesses to make use of the Enterprise Financing Scheme to help with their working capital,” said Mr Png. Further supply chain disruption is another worry, said chairman Peter Ong. This as factory closures in China have been lengthened on the back of cities being locked down and the week-long Chinese New Year holiday extended as local authorities try to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Already, it has been “very difficult” to ship goods in and out of China, he added, citing conversations he’s had with some businesses. Still, Mr Ong stressed that it remains too early to assess the economic impact, as the situation remains fast-evolving while experts have yet to pinpoint how the virus transmission and containment will play out. At the moment, businesses seem “calm” and appear to be more prepared as they draw on the experience of 2003’s Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak. “We don’t see any businesses that are extremely anxious about the current situation,” Mr Png told reporters. He added that many businesses have also drawn up business continuity plans even before the government agency released its advisory. “They know what to do … and are quite prepared to take the necessary measures,” said Mr Png. “We are heartened by that.” Nevertheless, ESG is watching the developments closely and is in regular contact with the trade associations and chambers (TACS), as well as businesses “to determine the impact, and how we can help those who are more affected”. The Government has also said that it stands ready to help enterprises and workers, said Mr Ong. Thus far, targeted support has been announced for directly-affected sectors like the transport and tourism sectors. “Depending on how the situation progresses, (there can be) broader measures to address wider economic slowdown to help viable firms stay afloat and workers stay in their jobs,” he said. CONTINUE TRANSFORMATION JOURNEY Despite the added uncertainties, ESG urged businesses to continue on the transformation journey. Over the past year, the agency, which was formed two years ago from the merger of IE Singapore and Spring Singapore, has been looking at helping Singapore firms raise productivity, strengthen innovation and accelerate internationalisation. It will continue to do so by providing enterprises, especially SMEs, with support in productivity and capability upgrading, innovation and business transformation. It will also step up its internationalisation drive, by supporting first-timers to expand overseas at an earlier stage and those that are already overseas to deepen and diversify their footprint abroad. “Given the size of our market, Singapore enterprises cannot afford to not seek out opportunities globally,” said Mr Ong. “In fact, situations such as the coronavirus and geopolitical risks make it even more critical for enterprises to diversify their businesses and markets.” Echoing that, Mr Png said it is important for businesses to do so because this will help them to compete locally and overseas, and be better positioned in time of a recovery. “For when the recovery comes, while there may be pent-up demand, there will also be pent-up supply competing for new businesses to make up for lost revenue,” he said. “ENCOURAGED” BY 2019 PERFORMANCE ESG is taking heart from an encouraging performance in 2019, where 11,450 businesses embarked on 13,560 projects to raise productivity, enhance innovation and accelerate internationalisation. These projects are expected to create S$17.3 billion in value added and 21,700 PMET jobs, it said in its annual report released on Friday. Compared with 2018, the number of businesses and projects supported last year increased significantly – up 43 per cent and 52 per cent, respectively, with SMEs undertaking a majority of these projects. The number of productivity and capability building projects saw an 85 per cent jump compared to the previous year. These were taken on by 8,300 businesses, largely from the services industries such as lifestyle, trade, transport and logistics, to improve business processes and become more manpower lean. The number of innovation projects remained consistent, with 550 enterprises supported last year, according to ESG. Turning to internationalisation projects, it helped 2,600 firms to go overseas with 3,000 projects. Nearly two-third of these businesses came from the wholesale trade, professional services, information and communications technology, and retail sectors. The agency also gave on-the-ground support to 600 projects, largely in China and Southeast Asia. These projects are expected to bring about S$8.8 billion in overseas sales and S$8.9 billion in overseas investments. It also provided assistance to about 2,000 start-ups through its Startup SG programmes and partners. Among others, ESG expanded its Global Innovation Alliance network to 13 cities in 10 markets, with the addition of Shanghai, Ho Chi Minh, Bangalore and London last year. This aims to help more start-ups and tech SMEs find collaboration and innovation opportunities overseas. Mr Png described the 2019 numbers as “encouraging”, noting that there was a “significant increase” in the number of SMEs embarking on capability upgrading, business transformation and overseas ventures despite a challenging economic environment. There is also the economic benefits, in terms of new value added and additional skilled jobs, he said. “It shows that our enterprise development strategies are gaining traction,” said Mr Png.

06 Feb 2020 06:28AM,Commentary: Looks like containment of novel coronavirus not as effective as we had hoped,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Critical differences between the epidemiology of the novel coronavirus and SARS make containment less effective as a strategy and mitigation more urgent, says Hitoshi Oshitani. TOKYO: A novel coronavirus is rapidly spreading within China, with more cases discovered outside the country this past week. The virus is genetically close to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus , which caused a global outbreak in 2002 to 2003. Despite their similarities, however, this new virus shares few epidemiological characteristics with SARS, which was successfully contained after causing more than 8,000 cases with 774 deaths worldwide. This new virus may be more difficult to control than SARS. The number of cases has already exceeded the total number of cases of SARS – and in just one month. It is likely that the Wuhan health authorities tried to contain the new virus using the same strategy previously used for the containment of SARS. However, containment by these means looks like an less effective means to deal with this new virus compared to SARS. We have insufficient epidemiological data to understand the whole epidemiology of this novel coronavirus because we are still in the early stages of its spread. At this time, however, we have seen some critical differences between the epidemiology of SARS and this virus that may make this much more difficult to manage than SARS. HOW EFFECTIVE IS CONTAINMENT? Active and comprehensive discovery of infected individuals, rapid isolation of cases, and identification of all close contacts by contact tracing were the fundamental strategies for the containment of SARS. However, several conditions must be met for this containment strategy to be effective.   First, the majority of the infected individuals must develop typical, identifiable clinical symptoms that can be used to distinguish between the target disease and other infections. Second, only those with typical clinical symptoms can infect others. Third, infected individuals are contagious only in the late stage of illness. For SARS, these conditions were met, and quick containment was therefore possible. Most infected individuals developed severe viral pneumonia, which was distinguishable from other infections such as seasonal influenza. Furthermore, only those with severe and typical symptoms could infect others. Finally, infected individuals were contagious only in the late stage of illness. Therefore, we were able to identify most infected individuals and isolate them as soon as they developed symptoms to prevent further transmission. Eventually, all chains of transmission were interrupted, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global containment of SARS on Jul 5, 2003 - eight months after the emergence of the virus. PROBLEMS WITH CONTAINMENT In contrast, the containment strategy used for SARS has not been successful in containing this novel coronavirus. This is because this virus does not meet the aforementioned necessary conditions. Unlike SARS, some or many infected individuals developed only mild or no symptoms, precluding the identification of all possible cases. In Singapore, some Singaporeans who had come into contact with a group of Chinese tourists were diagnosed with the infection, despite two not having any signs of pneumonia when they first presented themselves to healthcare facilities.   In Japan, five out of the 565 evacuees from China tested positive for the virus despite not having any symptoms. Furthermore, limited evidence suggests that infected individuals with mild or no symptoms can be contagious. Asymptomatic infected individuals may not be a driving force for the ongoing outbreak due to a lower chance of successful transmission compared to symptomatic cases. However, if an asymptomatic individual becomes a source of the transmission chain, then contact tracing cannot be used to identify such a chain. This is a critical problem for containment. Some accounts of transmission suggest that individuals are contagious even during the incubation period, which is the duration between exposure and the onset of symptoms. There is documented evidence indicating that a traveller from China passed the virus to some of her colleagues during the incubation period in Germany, which the science community is debating over. If cases are infectious during the incubation period, it may be too late to prevent further transmission, even if we can isolate patients soon after they develop symptoms. The majority of individuals infected with SARS did not infect any other persons. During that outbreak in Singapore in 2003, more than 80 per cent of infected individuals did not pass the virus to anyone else.   There were some “super-spreader events” in which one infected individual infected many others. These were the major amplifying factor for SARS. So far, no “super-spreading event” has been documented for the novel coronavirus, but more data is needed before we can rule out such an event. Because possibly only a small fraction of cases are being detected and reported, it is difficult to know the exact transmissibility between individuals for this virus. Due to the rapidly increasing number of cases in mainland China, its transmissibility is considered to be higher than that of SARS. In addition, the world of 2020 is quite different compared to that of 2003. Many more international flights now depart from China to many more countries than before. While SARS spread to more than 30 countries and areas within eight months, the novel coronavirus has spread to more than 20 countries within one month. No sustained human-to-human transmission has been reported outside mainland China. However, “invisible transmission chains” may already have been established in some countries. Therefore, we may see a sudden increase in the number of cases when such transmission chains are fully realised. This is becoming a real possibility. SHIFT TO MITIGATION Because containment appears less feasible and effective, we must shift our objective to mitigate the impact. Thus, the most important goal right now is to reduce the mortality rate to be as low as possible. Every country should be prepared for an increasing number of severe cases. This may be more challenging in countries with limited healthcare resources. We urgently need to establish a mechanism to support these countries. It is difficult to predict how the outbreak will evolve in China and other countries, but an imminent risk persists of large outbreaks outside of China. The international community should work together, and China has a critical role in this battle. Other countries can learn from China’s current experience. For example, we must learn and distribute what measures are effective or ineffective. The WHO should continue to play a leading role for international coordination, especially with China, to fight against this global threat.

06 Feb 2020 09:55AM,Oil gains a second day as coronavirus optimism may mean demand rebound,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TOKYO: Oil futures rose for a second day on Thursday (Feb 6) as investors took optimism around unconfirmed reports of possible medical advances to combat the coronavirus outbreak in China as a sign fuel demand could rebound in the world's biggest oil importer. Prices also gained after a government report on Wednesday showed US gasoline and diesel inventories fell. Brent futures rose by 62 cents, or 1.1 per cent, to US$55.90 a barrel by 1.42am GMT, having risen 2.4 per cent in the last session. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures gained 73 cents, or 1.4 per cent, to US$51.48 a barrel after rising 2.3 per cent on Wednesday. Commodities, equities and other markets have been buoyed by unconfirmed reports of a possible advance in producing treatment drugs for the coronavirus that has shut down transport and limited industrial activity in China. However, the World Health Organization has played down the reports of ""breakthrough"" drugs being discovered. Furthermore, an additional 73 people on the Chinese mainland died on Wednesday from the virus, the highest daily increase since the outbreak started, and another 3,694 new cases were reported, raising the total to 28,018. In the US, gasoline stockpiles dropped last week, counter to analysts' expectations for a gain, and diesel inventories fell more than expected, the Energy Information Administration reported. However, crude stockpiles rose by a more-than-expected 3.4 million barrels last week to 435 million barrels. ""While small falls in US product stocks suggest demand is holding up, it would take a surge in US consumption to even go some of the way to offset the slump in China's consumption owing to the outbreak of coronavirus,"" Capital Economics said. Commodity supply chains in China have been disrupted to the extent that short-term sales of crude oil, along with liquefied natural gas, fell to nearly zero this week. Buyers in China, the world's biggest importer of most commodities, are considering taking legal action to avoid honoring purchase agreements. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

07 Feb 2020 03:30AM,It's too early to say coronavirus peaking in China: WHO,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners GENEVA: The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday (Feb 6) it was too early to say that China's coronavirus outbreak was peaking, but noted that the country had recorded its first day of a drop in the number of new infections. The death toll from the virus in mainland China jumped on Thursday to more than 630, with more than 30,000 confirmed infections inside the world's second-largest economy. That number had risen by nearly 4,000 from Wednesday to Thursday. Dr Mike Ryan, WHO's top emergencies expert, said it was very difficult to make predictions on the course of the disease first reported in the central city of Wuhan in late December, noting: ""We are still in the middle of an intense outbreak. ""There are cycles of transmission, and we may see those cases increase in the coming days. But at least for the moment, things are stable,"" Ryan told a news conference. ""But 4,000 cases or nearly, 3,700 coronavirus cases confirmed in a single day, is nothing to celebrate and is certainly still a great worry,"" he said. There is a constant rise in infections in the epicentre of Hubei province, which accounts for about 80 per cent of cases, Ryan said, adding: ""But we haven't seen that same acceleration in provinces outside Hubei. And equally we haven't seen that acceleration in Hong Kong, Macao, in Taiwanese people either."" Earlier, the United States and China clashed over the issue of Taiwan's exclusion from WHO meetings, including the ongoing executive board, where it is represented by China, with Beijing accusing Washington of political ""hype-up"". ""It's hard to believe just two months ago this virus was unknown to us,"" WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters. ""We have already learned so much about it, we know its DNA, we know it can be transmitted from one person to another, we know that those most at risk are older people and those with underlying health conditions,"" he said. But there is still a lot to learn, including the source of the virus, its severity and ability to spread, Tedros said. Maria van Kerkhove, a WHO epidemiologist, said that the virus causes a ""full spectrum of disease"". ""You have mild cases which look like the common cold, which have some respiratory symptoms - sore throat, runny nose, fever - all way through pneumonia. And there can be varying levels of pneumomia, all the way through multiple organ failure and death,"" she said, calling for further study of mild cases and how easily they can spread the virus.

13 Feb 2020 10:04AM,Tokyo Olympics boss blasts 'irresponsible rumours' over coronavirus shutdown,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TOKYO: Tokyo Olympic organisers stressed Thursday (Feb 13) they are not considering scrapping the Games due to the coronavirus and blasted ""irresponsible rumours"" to the contrary. With only 162 days to go until the opening ceremony, concerns have been raised about Japan's hosting of the Games with the virus spreading throughout Asia. But Tokyo 2020 CEO Yoshiro Mori slapped down such concerns at a meeting with top International Olympic Committee officials. ""With regards to the coronavirus ... there are many irresponsible rumours but I would like to make it clear again that we are not considering postponing or cancelling the Games,"" he said. ""We would like to coordinate with the national government and act in a calm manner,"" he stressed. The virus has already forced the rescheduling of a swathe of sporting events in Asia, including Olympic qualification competitions for boxing and basketball - both in China. Formula One's Shanghai Grand Prix has been postponed from mid-April, with the inaugural Vietnamese Grand Prix also under threat as well as the Hong Kong Sevens. Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike has promised to implement ""thorough measures"" to protect people from the coronavirus in the run-up to the Olympics. Japan has not seen any deaths from COVID-19 but has 28 cases on its soil, with four in serious condition in hospital. Another 174 people, including a quarantine officer, have been infected on a cruise ship floating off the Japanese coast - the outbreak's largest single cluster. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government has come under fire for its handling of the infection, especially quarantine measures seen as too lax in the early stages of the epidemic. ""These struggles in turn have sparked concerns about the forthcoming Tokyo Olympics, as Japan prepares for the arrival of millions of international visitors over the summer,"" said Tobias Harris from Teneo Consultancy. The mayor of the Olympic Village, Saburo Kawabuchi, told the meeting there was ""still no clue as to when the virus will be resolved"" and appeared to pin hopes on increased humidity to kill off the disease. ""We have the rainy season that could defeat the virus,"" he said. In China on Thursday, hard-hit Hubei province where the virus emerged announced 242 more deaths and nearly 15,000 extra patients as authorities changed their threshold for diagnosis. At least 1,355 people have now died nationwide and nearly 60,000 have been infected after Hubei's health commission reported the new numbers.

24 Jan 2020 07:03AM,WHO says 'bit too early' to declare coronavirus a global emergency,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners GENEVA: The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Thursday (Jan 23) it was ""a bit too early"" to declare a new coronavirus a global health emergency as China put millions of people on lockdown amid an outbreak. Just hours later, China reported that the number of confirmed cases had risen to 830, with 25 dead. The National Health Commission said authorities were also examining 1,072 suspected cases of the virus that first emerged in central city of Wuhan. Non-fatal cases have been found in at least seven other countries. Health officials fear the transmission rate could accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel at home and abroad during week-long holidays for Chinese New Year, which begins on Saturday. Nonetheless, it was a ""bit too early"" to consider the outbreak a ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern,"" WHO Emergency Committee panel chair Didier Houssin said after the body met in Geneva. Such a designation would have required countries to step up the international response. ""Make no mistake, though, this is an emergency in China,"" said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. ""It has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one,"" he said. Scrambling to contain the outbreak, the local government in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in Hubei province, suspended most transport on Thursday, including outgoing flights, and people were told not to leave. Hours later, neighboring Huanggang, a city of about 7 million people, announced similar measures. By Friday, 10 cities near Wuhan had halted public transport, effectively placing a quarantine on 20 million people. ""The lockdown of 11 million people is unprecedented in public health history,"" said Gauden Galea, the WHO's representative in Beijing.   The organisation said, however, that it was not yet recommending any broader restrictions on travel or trade.  The previously unknown virus strain is believed to have emerged late last year from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in Wuhan. It has created alarm because there are a number of unknowns surrounding it. It is too early to know just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. There is no vaccine for the virus, which can spread through respiratory transmission. Symptoms include fever, difficulty breathing and coughing.  Michael Ryan, head of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, said data from China suggested almost three-quarters of the cases were in people aged over 40, with some 40% having underlying health conditions. ""At the moment, we haven't seen many mild cases,"" he said, cautioning that it was difficult at the start of an epidemic to estimate the severity or true fatality rate. There had been human-to-human transmission of the virus in China, limited to family groups and health workers, said Tedros. Three research teams working on a vaccine, a global coalition set up to fight diseases said. It is aiming to have a shot developed and approved within a year. The committee of 16 independent experts had been divided in its conclusion not to declare a global emergency, said Tedros, adding that the decision ""should not be taken as a sign that the WHO does not think the situation is serious."" Peter Piot, a professor of global health and director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the outbreak was at a critical phase. ""Regardless of the decision not to declare this a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, intensified international collaboration and more resources will be crucial to stopping this outbreak in its tracks,"" he said. ""There cannot be any complacency as to the need for global action."" The biggest tumble in Chinese stocks in more than eight months led global equity markets lower on Thursday as concern mounted about the outbreak. TRAVEL WARNINGS In Wuhan, the Hankou railway station was nearly deserted on Thursday, state broadcasts showed. State media reported highway toll booths around Wuhan were closing, effectively cutting off road exits, and all ride-hailing services would be cancelled from Friday. Guards were patrolling highways, one resident said.   As the city slipped into isolation, residents thronged hospitals for medical checks and rushed to buy supplies, clearing out supermarket shelves and queuing for petrol. Other cities were also taking steps to contain the virus. Nearby Ezhou shut train stations. Beijing cancelled large gatherings, including two Lunar New Year temple fairs, and closed the Forbidden City, the capital's most famous tourist attraction, to visitors until further notice. The US State Department warned travellers to exercise increased caution in China as airports worldwide stepped up the screening of passengers arriving from the country. Cases have already been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States. Five people were being tested in Scotland for the virus as a precaution, the BBC reported on Thursday. All had respiratory symptoms and had recently been in Wuhan, it said. Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, which has two confirmed cases, is turning two holiday camps into quarantine stations as a precaution. Taiwan has banned anyone from Wuhan from going to the island. Chinese people had their own ways of protecting themselves. ""I go straight to where I need to go, and then I go home,"" said 79-year-old Li Meihua, from behind a mask, on the streets of Shanghai.

10 Feb 2020 10:56AM,China stutters back to work as coronavirus deaths soar,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: Millions of people in China were returning to work on Monday (Feb 10) after an extended holiday designed to slow the spread of the new coronavirus, which has killed more than 900 people in the country. At least 40,000 people in China have now been infected by the virus, believed to have emerged late last year in Hubei province's capital Wuhan. And although the World Health Organization (WHO) has said there are tentative signs the epidemic is stabilising in China, the agency's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned that the number of cases recorded overseas could be just ""the tip of the iceberg"". His comments came as an advance team of WHO international experts left late Sunday for China, led by Bruce Aylward, a veteran of previous health emergencies. In an attempt to contain the virus, cities in Hubei have been locked down and transport routes across the country cut to stop the movement of hundreds of millions of people who usually visit family during the annual Lunar New Year holiday. The unprecedented measures included an extension of the holiday, with citizens told to stay inside as much as possible. Officially the holiday was extended by only three days, but many cities and provinces pushed the deadline until Feb 10. The measures have left businesses, shops, factories and tourist sites closed and turned many cities into ghost towns, sparking concerns about the impact of the outbreak on the economy. But there were some signs Monday of the country beginning to make a return to normality. Roads in Beijing and Shanghai had significantly more traffic than in recent days and the southern city of Guangzhou said it would start to resume normal public transport from Monday. The city had been running a partial service due to the epidemic, said city authorities - who reminded people to continue avoiding crowded places. WORK, INTERRUPTED However, tens of millions of people in Hubei province were not returning to work, as the province - the epicentre of the outbreak - remained under lockdown with travel links cut off. Many companies were offering staff the option of working from home.   Car manufacturer Volkswagen said while some of its factories would re-open on Monday, others had delayed production for another week. Toyota has extended the closure of its Chinese plants to Feb 16. Many factories involved in manufacturing medical equipment had already returned to work. According to the National Development and Reform Commission, around 87 per cent of the country's medical mask production had already resumed. China's central bank said it would make 300 billion yuan (US$43 billion) available in special loans to banks from Monday to help businesses involved in fighting the epidemic. But the tourism industry remains in the doldrums, with several countries banning arrivals from China, major airlines suspending flights and international and domestic tour groups being halted. Schools and universities across the country remained closed. 'TIP OF THE ICEBERG' The death toll from the novel coronavirus has overtaken global fatalities in the 2002-03 SARS epidemic. China drew international condemnation for covering up cases during the SARS outbreak, but the WHO has praised the measures Beijing has taken this time.   However, the health body has warned that the figures could still ""shoot up"". Ian Lipkin - a professor at Columbia University who worked with China on the SARS outbreak - also warned of the risk of a ""bump"" in infection cases when people return to work. WHO chief Tedros said there had been some ""concerning instances"" of cases overseas in people with no travel history to China. ""The detection of a small number of cases may indicate more widespread transmission in other countries; in short, we may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg"", he tweeted. Meanwhile in Hong Kong, thousands of people stranded aboard the World Dream cruise ship for five days were allowed to disembark Sunday after its 1,800 crew tested negative for the new coronavirus. The ship carried three Chinese passengers to Vietnam between Jan 19 and 24 who were later found to be infected with the SARS-like coronavirus. Health authorities in the semi-autonomous Asian financial hub said the crew and a similar number of passengers had been released from quarantine.

31 Jan 2020 06:06PM,Wuhan coronavirus: Singapore to widen travel restrictions to all new visitors who recently travelled to mainland China,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: In an effort to minimise the risk of community spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, new visitors of any nationality with recent travel history to mainland China will not be allowed to enter Singapore, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said on Friday (Jan 31). These visitors will also not be allowed to transit in Singapore, as part of restrictions that will come into effect at 11.59pm on Saturday. Those with Chinese passports, with the exception of Singapore permanent residents (PRs) and long-term pass holders, will also not be allowed to enter Singapore. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) will, with immediate effect, suspend the issuance of all forms of new visas to those with Chinese passports. Singapore's status as a visa-free transit facility will be suspended for Chinese passport holders. Previously issued short-term and multiple-visit visas for those with Chinese passports will also be suspended. Those who hold such visas will not be allowed into Singapore during this period.   In a press release on Friday evening, the Manpower Ministry also announced that with immediate effect, it will reject all new work pass applications for foreign workers from mainland China until further notice. Renewal applications for existing work pass holders will not be affected.  Earlier this week, the restrictions only applied to new visitors who had recently travelled to China's Hubei province. However, China recently announced that the number of reported infections in the country had doubled since Jan 28 to more than 9,000 and that the likelihood of widespread community transmission in other parts of China is now high. ""As a result, we are likely to see a sharper rise in the local transmission of the virus in Chinese cities beyond the Hubei province in the coming days,"" said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a press release on Friday. At the briefing, Mr Wong also said that Singapore residents with recent travel history to mainland China will be issued a travel advisory and asked to take a 14-day leave of absence. These include Singapore citizens, PRs as well as those with long-term passes. Commissioner of ICA Marvin Sim, who was at the briefing, said the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore will be disseminating the information to all airlines to ensure smooth implementation of the new measures. Cabin crew who have to travel to China as part of their job will not be subject to the new measures, but in consultation with the Health Ministry, will have to take precautionary measures, he said. They will only be able to enter or transit if they are well, he added. “These additional travel restrictions on top of all that we have already introduced over the past few days will enable us to limit the number of new cases here and to reduce the risk of community spread in Singapore,” said Mr Wong, who co-chairs a ministerial task force set up to deal with the coronavirus situation. Responding to a question from the media, Mr Wong stressed that the restrictions are not nationality-based. ""It is not a nationality issue,"" he said. ""The motivation is the origins of the virus and that beyond Hubei, the virus is now spreading to other parts of China - as we have said, there is assessment that this is happening."" When asked for a clarification that all Chinese passport holders who are not residents of Singapore will be barred from Singapore regardless of their previous travel, Mr Wong said: ""This is the policy because it is difficult to know your previous travel history."" At the operational level, there may be appeals,"" he added. The passport is being used as a ""proxy"", he said. ""I can imagine somebody may say 'I’m a passport holder, but I have not be in China all this while'. I think we can take that separate from the policy, and at the operational level, ICA will have to deal with these instances,"" he said.  Meanwhile, MOH's director of medical services Kenneth Mak said there remains no evidence of community spread. Of those suspected of having the coronavirus, 164 of them have been ruled out while test results are still pending for 49 others. “The situation remains fluid, it is constantly changing. We do not rule out taking further measures,” Mr Wong said.

31 Jan 2020 02:04PM,"Singapore has 'done well' in handling Wuhan coronavirus situation, but must remain vigilant: PM Lee","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore has done well so far in handling the Wuhan coronavirus situation, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said during a visit to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Friday (Jan 31). Several of the 13 confirmed Wuhan coronavirus cases in Singapore are currently warded in isolation rooms at the centre. Mr Lee said the country was able to quickly catch cases of the virus, as well as isolate and treat them, adding that doctors have told him the patients are faring well. ""But we have to continue to be vigilant, because the outbreak is far from over. In fact, it may still be accelerating in China,"" said Mr Lee. ""We have to continue to be on guard,"" he said, adding the Government and healthcare workers were prepared. Continuing on this path would help ensure community spread of the virus is not a problem here, he said. ""There's every reason to be watchful, but there's also every reason to be confident,"" said Mr Lee.   The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday declared the virus outbreak a ""global emergency"", with more than 9,800 confirmed cases and more than 200 deaths in China alone. The WHO's assessment ""confirmed Singapore's view of the situation"", he said, adding the team of ministers tasked with handling the situation is evaluating what to do next. On Thursday, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong announced that the Government would issue four masks to each household here. This came amid reports of many retailers islandwide running out of the items, over widespread concerns of the Wuhan coronavirus.  He also said there should not be discrimination against Chinese nationals, noting the virus can infect people of any race. ""They (China) are trying very hard to fight it, and I think we should work with them to help make sure this is not a global problem,"" he said.   One key difference from the SARS crisis is that social media is allowing rumours to spread more quickly, said Mr Lee, adding he was ""very glad"" the authorities had the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) to address the spread of untruths. Some of these rumours are ""malicious and deliberate"", he said, made up by people whose aim was to deliberately foment fear, uncertainty and doubt. These have been promptly addressed by POFMA, he said, adding that the Government is putting out accurate information as quickly as it can be verified.  Mr Lee also thanked healthcare workers on the frontlines, in places such as the NCID, adding he had a lot of respect for the difficult job they had to do.

11 Feb 2020 06:15AM,‘Not enough manpower to get food to people in need’: Food charities hit as coronavirus measures ramped up,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Groups that help feed families in need have seen most volunteers drop out. And they worry about the impact of panic-buying on the flow of food donations. SINGAPORE: As some Singaporeans hunker down and stock up on food essentials in the face of the coronavirus outbreak, charities and volunteer groups are concerned about the impact on their ability to get supplies of food out to those relying on their help. Since the Government raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Friday, schools and companies have curtailed many activities, while anxious shoppers emptied the shelves at NTUC FairPrice outlets and wet markets. Some charity groups like Free Food For All (FFA), which provides free cooked meals and rations to low-income Singaporeans, are worried about what the stockpiling by consumers could mean for donations. “I see a potential hit on the amount of food donations we will receive,” said FFA’s founder Nizar Mohd Shariff. “We typically receive (from retailers) food that is not sold or near expiry – but if items are flying off the shelves, what’s left to be given to us?” The kind of mentality spurring the panic-buying is also worrying. “On normal days, people think, ‘I’ll donate if I have enough.’ But when people are hoarding stuff out of fear, donations would be the last thing on their mind.”   To discourage stockpiling, NTUC FairPrice has since placed limits on the purchase of high-demand items like rice, and reassured customers that it has ready stock of essential items. Food From The Heart’s (FFTH) chief executive Sim Bee Hia is concerned about how this might impact donations through its NTUC Shop & Donate scheme, where the public can order food staples to be delivered to a charity. This “has always been a steady source of food for us, especially rice”, said Ms Sim. SHARP DROP IN VOLUNTEERS But a far more urgent concern for the food assistance groups is the drying-up of their pool of volunteers in the past week or so. “There isn’t enough manpower to get food out to people in need,” said Ms Nichol Ng, co-founder of The Food Bank Singapore. People are forgetting that while this virus is going on, people in need still need to eat and life goes on. At FFTH, Ms Sim said she was “scrambling” to find volunteers to pack almost 2,000 food ration packs by the end of this week. A desperate call was put out on Facebook. “From Jan 31 till now, about 12 volunteer sessions with corporations and schools, who were supposed to help with the packing of food rations, were cancelled,” she said. “There were also individuals who signed up but were a no-show.”   The Food Bank Singapore relies on students to sort out and process public donations of canned food, biscuits and other groceries, or huge pallets of food from industry donors, before these can be redirected to beneficiaries. But since cases of the novel coronavirus began cropping up in Singapore, groups have been cancelling. “Our student volunteer pool has been wiped out,” said Ms Ng, adding that beneficiaries who have been getting rations from them twice a month “may only get it once a month”. The Food Bank also has a programme where companies, as part of a corporate responsibility programme for staff, can buy items that beneficiaries need, pack them, and go distributing door to door. “But now there’s none of that… The total food donation volume is down by 50 per cent,” said Ms Ng. For Willing Hearts, a cooked food charity that provides 6,500 free meals a day islandwide, the lack of manpower means it now takes longer to prepare and deliver food.   “Companies are telling employees to stay home, while school volunteers have completely disappeared in the last two weeks,” said Mr Teh Eng Hua, the president of Willing Hearts. But do or die, the charities that CNA Insider spoke to are doing all they can to get food to those who need it. They rely on their few staff and the odd volunteers who still turn up to help. The Food Bank is appealing to companies that can’t volunteer their time for now, to donate money instead so that it can buy the provisions needed to continue its service to beneficiaries. SPARE A THOUGHT FOR THEM FFTH is determined that its beneficiaries see no disruption to their food supply. “For the lower-income and vulnerable groups, seeing the empty supermarket shelves would have brought a sense of uneasiness because they are already struggling financially,” said Ms Sim. That’s why we need to honour our commitment. Food should be the last thing they are worried about. The good news is that those in need can turn to other sources of free food – like community fridges in Yishun stocked by donors and food rescuers, and FFTH’s The Community Shop @ Mountbatten just launched on Saturday.   While shoppers were packing supermarkets the day after DORSCON Orange was declared, Ms Sim said: “It was humbling to see that our beneficiaries were getting what they needed (at our free shop) without having to go through the frenzy at Sheng Shiong or NTUC FairPrice.” Indeed, the weekend’s binge-buying had charities appealing to Singaporeans to think of the impact of their actions on the low-income group. For instance, Ms Ng pointed out that those on assistance get NTUC FairPrice vouchers to buy groceries – and if the shelves were empty, they’d be forced to find the cash to buy elsewhere. She added: “We can’t stop people from panic buying. But if they really want to buy stuff, they could think of those in need and buy some for us as well,” Ms Sim took a lighter perspective. “I hope people realise that they bought too much,” she said with a laugh. “And then they’ll donate to us.” HOW YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE Food From The Heart: To volunteer, visit https://www.foodfromtheheart.sg or WhatsApp 81280432 Food Bank Singapore: To donate, visit https://www.giving.sg/the-food-bank-singapore-ltd Free Food For All: To donate or volunteer, visit https://freefood.org.sg National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre: To volunteer or donate to various COVID-19 charity efforts, visit https://www.giving.sg/sgunited TOUCH Community Services: To volunteer for Meals-On-Wheels delivery, call 68046565 Willing Hearts: To volunteer, visit http://www.willinghearts.org.sg It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

01 Feb 2020 05:31AM,Nearly 200 Americans airlifted from China placed under coronavirus quarantine,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners WASHINGTON: Nearly 200 Americans evacuated from China and voluntarily confined to a California air base for 72 hours of coronavirus screenings were placed under a mandatory 14-day quarantine on Friday (Jan 31), as US health officials intensified precautions against spread of the disease. The move by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), its first quarantine in 50 years, was announced a day after the State Department issued its strongest warning against travel to China due to an epidemic of the new virus, which has claimed more than 200 lives. ""We are preparing as if this is the next pandemic, but we are hoping that is not the case,"" said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center For Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, in a telephone interview from the agency's headquarters in Atlanta. The United States angered China on Friday after it issued a travel warning over a coronavirus epidemic that has been declared a global emergency and led to increasing supply problems for businesses. Originating in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the flu-like coronavirus first identified earlier this month has resulted in the deaths of 213 people in China, out of a total number of cases approaching 10,000. The quarantine order requires all 195 Americans airlifted from Wuhan to remain isolated in special housing at March Air Reserve Base near Los Angeles for the entire 14-day incubation period of the disease. The two-week period runs from the time they left China on Tuesday. ""This is a precautionary and preventive step to maximize the containment of the virus in the interest of the health of the American public,"" the CDC said in a statement. SCREENING TEST LIMITED The CDC said on Wednesday, the day the evacuees landed, that they were being kept, on a voluntary basis, at the base for at least 72 hours while they underwent medical evaluation for symptoms of the virus and CDC laboratory tests. The plan then was to allow the passengers to return to their homes, absent any indication of exposure or illness, leaving state and local health authorities to continue monitoring the evacuees through the remainder of the incubation period. That plan would have permitted members of the group to take public transportation home. CDC officials said on Wednesday that people incubating the infection before symptoms appear are generally not regarded as contagious. But Messonnier on Friday cited emerging evidence that the virus can be spread by someone who is infected but not yet showing signs of being ill, which include fever, cough and other respiratory symptoms. The CDC also pointed to a limitation of the screening test it had developed for the virus. Even if a test result comes back negative, ""it does not conclusively mean an individual is at no risk of developing the disease over the likely 14-day incubation period,"" the agency said in a statement. “We are looking in people’s noses to see if they have the virus there,” but CDC is not certain the test is specific enough to identify whether someone is incubating the virus, Messonnier said. “This test is a point-in-time test that should not be relied on to predict whether this person will become ill.” TRIED TO LEAVE BASE The blanket 14-day CDC quarantine for all 195 evacuees was instituted after one of the passengers, who was not identified, sought to leave the base without permission on Wednesday night. He was immediately slapped with an individual quarantine order issued by Riverside County health authorities. It was not clear whether that incident played a role in the CDC's quarantine order on Friday. As of Thursday, none of the group at the base had exhibited signs of the disease, local health officials said. The evacuees, who were flown aboard a government-chartered cargo jet to California after a refueling stop in Alaska, consist of State Department employees from the US Consulate in Wuhan, their immediate family members and some other Americans who were welcomed to join the flight, the CDC said. The State Department said Friday it is working with US and Chinese agencies to arrange for additional flights of Americans out of Wuhan. Washington also plans to evacuate non-essential government employees and family members from the US Embassy in Beijing and consulates in Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenyang due to the coronavirus outbreak, a State Department official said on Thursday. The CDC has tallied six confirmed US cases of coronavirus, none fatal, including the first known transmission of the virus from one person to another within the United States - a couple in Illinois.

31 Jan 2020 08:17PM,"Singaporean evacuated from Wuhan among country's 3 new cases of coronavirus, total now 16: MOH","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) confirmed three new cases of the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore on Friday (Jan 31), bringing the total to 16 cases. All three cases recently travelled to China's Wuhan, where the virus originated. THREE NEW CASES The 14th case is a 31-year-old Chinese national with a Singapore work pass. He arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 26, and reported to be asymptomatic on his flight but developed symptoms on Jan 28. He sought medical treatment at a clinic on Thursday and was taken to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) in an ambulance. The man tested positive for the coronavirus at about 11pm on Thursday. He is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID. Prior to admission, the man stayed at home in Jurong East Street 13. The 15th case is a 47-year-old Singaporean, who had travelled to Wuhan with her family and was one of the 92 Singaporeans who were evacuated from the city on Thursday. She was asymptomatic when she boarded the flight, but was found to have a fever during the medical screening at Changi Airport and was taken to NCID. She tested positive for the coronavirus at about 2pm on Friday and is warded in an isolation room at NCID. The 16th case is a 38-year-old Chinese man who arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 22. He tested positive for the coronavirus at about 2pm on Friday and is currently warded in an isolation room at the Singapore General Hospital. All three cases are in stable condition, said MOH. PREVIOUS CASES ALL IN STABLE CONDITION: MOH The death toll in China has risen to 213, with nearly 10,000 infected, according to official figures released on Friday. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the situation a global emergency. All of the 13 previously confirmed cases in Singapore came from Wuhan in Hubei province. The first case of the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore was confirmed on Jan 23 - about a month after the first cases were reported in the Chinese city. The seven men and six women, aged between 31 and 73, are being treated at isolation wards at NCID, Changi General Hospital, Singapore General Hospital and Sengkang General Hospital. In its press release on Friday, MOH shared more information about the 13th confirmed case, a 73-year-old woman who arrived in Singapore on Jan 21. The ministry said she was a close contact of the second confirmed case and multiple attempts were made to contact her. She was located on Jan 28 and reported having developed symptoms on the same day. The woman was taken to NCID, where she was isolated, and she tested positive for the coronavirus at about 2pm on Thursday. MOH said that prior to her admission, the woman stayed at ParkRoyal Collection Pickering and Oasia Hotel Downtown, and visited Changi Airport and Jewel. She travelled by taxi and private transport. None of the 13 previously confirmed cases are critically ill, said the ministry. ""All of them remain in stable condition and most are improving,"" it added. As of noon on Friday, 198 of the suspected cases have tested negative for the virus. Test results for the remaining 35 cases are pending. MOH also said that it has identified 202 close contacts as of noon on Friday. Of the 162 who are still in Singapore, 156 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining six close contacts, said MOH.  Singapore on Friday announced that it will widen travel restrictions to include all new visitors with recent travel history to China. China also said it will send charter planes to bring home citizens from Hubei who are overseas ""as soon as possible"". The announcement came as a number of airlines, including Singapore Airlines and Scoot, announced they were halting or reducing flights to China as the country tackles the spread of the virus. In a bid to contain the possible spread of the virus, a total of 967 students and employees from schools in Singapore have been placed on leave of absence because of their recent travel history to China. On Saturday, authorities will begin distributing packs of four surgical masks for each Singapore household. There have been long queues for masks at pharmacies and retailers across the country.  Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing on Thursday reassured people that Singapore will have enough masks, provided the supply is managed ""appropriately"". Retailers were also warned against profiteering. A letter of demand was sent to retailer Deen Express after complaints of masks being sold at high prices at its store. The retailer will have to explain to the Price Controller the “basis of their selling prices for the sale of masks, including their cost price and profit margins”. Mr Chan discouraged people from panic buying and hoarding masks, saying it could ""jeopardise the entire system"".  Medical experts CNA spoke to cautioned that masks may offer a ""false sense of security"" if they are used wrongly by people protecting themselves against viruses. They should be used by people who do not feel well and are coughing, so as to protect others, a WHO representative said.

05 Feb 2020 07:01AM,China coronavirus death toll rises to 490 as more countries confirm local transmission,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The number of confirmed deaths from China's coronavirus outbreak jumped on Wednesday (Feb 5) to nearly 500, after Hong Kong reported its first death from the disease and millions more in China were ordered to stay indoors. The confirmed toll in mainland China rose to 490 after hardest-hit Hubei province reported 65 more people had died - the biggest single-day tally since the first fatalities emerged last month. The number of confirmed infections in China's coronavirus outbreak has reached 24,324 nationwide with 3,887 new cases reported, the National Health Commission said. More than 20 countries have confirmed cases of the virus, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a global health emergency, several governments to institute travel restrictions, and airlines to suspend flights to and from China. The WHO said Tuesday that the dramatic measures taken by China had provided a ""window of opportunity"" to halt transmission, while calling for more global solidarity to combat the virus.   The novel coronavirus has continued to spread with Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand on Tuesday reporting new infections that were not imported from China. In a sign of growing concern about a spread to other densely-populated Chinese metropolitan areas, authorities in three cities in eastern Zhejiang province - including one near Shanghai - limited the number of people allowed to leave their homes. Three districts in Hangzhou - including the area where the main office of Chinese tech giant Alibaba is based - now allow only one person per household to go outside every two days to buy necessities, affecting some three million people. The city is only 175km southwest of the financial hub of Shanghai, which has reported more than 200 cases, including one death.   Zhejiang has confirmed 829 cases - the highest number outside the central province of Hubei, whose capital Wuhan is the epicentre of the outbreak. The disease is believed to have emerged in December in a Wuhan market that sold wild animals, and spread rapidly as people travelled for the Lunar New Year holiday in January. China has struggled to contain the virus despite enacting unprecedented measures, including virtually locking down more than 50 million people in Hubei.   The WHO has said the outbreak does not yet constitute a ""pandemic"". The head of the organisation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, accused wealthy countries of falling short on their duties in sharing data, stating that: ""Of the 176 cases reported outside China so far, WHO has received complete case report forms for only 38 per cent."" HONG KONG'S FIRST DEATH The death of the 39-year-old man in Hong Kong came as the semi-autonomous city closed all but two land crossings with the Chinese mainland. Hong Kong media said the man had underlying health issues. He had visited Wuhan last month and his 72-year-old mother was also infected. The financial hub has been particularly on edge over the virus as it has revived memories of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002-03, which killed nearly 300 people in the city and 349 people in the mainland. Health officials noted that the mortality rate for the new coronavirus stood at 2.1 per cent, with most victims either old or with underlying health problems. SARS killed nearly 10 per cent of patients. NEW FOREIGN CASES Singapore confirmed the first four cases of people being infected locally, taking the total number of infections to 24. In another example of growing global anxiety, Japan has quarantined a cruise ship carrying 3,711 people and was testing those onboard for the virus after a former passenger was diagnosed with the illness in Hong Kong. Macau, China's semi-autonomous gambling hub that is popular with mainland Chinese visitors, decided to temporarily close all of its casinos for at least two weeks. And the UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Tuesday advised Britons to leave China, ""if they can"", to minimise their risk of exposure to the virus. The United States, meanwhile, acknowledged that the outbreak may delay Beijing's plans to purchase American goods under the terms of a deal meant to end the two countries' trade war. BEIJING ADMITS 'SHORTCOMINGS' China's Communist leadership made a rare admission of fallibility earlier this week, acknowledging ""shortcomings and difficulties exposed in the response to the epidemic"". The elite Politburo Standing Committee called for improvements to the ""national emergency management system"" at the meeting, according to the official Xinhua news agency on Monday. The government also said it ""urgently"" needed medical equipment such as surgical masks, protective suits, and safety goggles as it battles the outbreak. Most of the deaths have been in Wuhan and the rest of surrounding Hubei province, which has largely been under lockdown for almost two weeks. A 1,000-bed field hospital in Wuhan built from scratch within two weeks to relieve overburdened medical facilities started receiving patients on Tuesday, with a second makeshift hospital due to open later this week. A cultural building, an exhibition centre and a gymnasium have also been converted into improvised clinics with 3,400 beds. State media reported that the city planned to convert an additional eight facilities into hospitals.

13 Feb 2020 12:19PM,Hong Kong suspends schools for longer to counter spread of coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners HONG KONG: Scrambling to contain the spread of coronavirus, Hong Kong extended the suspension of schools on Thursday (Feb 13) until at least Mar 16 and told overseas students studying in the city there was no rush to return. The government also said civil servants would be allowed to work from home until Feb 23 to reduce the risk of the virus spreading. Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung said secondary and primary schools would not return from an already prolonged break until at least mid-March, extending an earlier suspension that was due to see students return to lessons on Mar 2. The news comes as the Chinese province at the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak reported a record rise in the death toll, as global health experts warned the epidemic could get far worse before it is brought under control. ""Social distancing and avoiding mass movement of people are the strategies for preventing and controlling the epidemic,"" Yeung said at a press conference. ""There is no urgency for students now staying in the mainland and other countries to return to Hong Kong."" The former British colony has confirmed 50 cases of coronavirus and one death. Many schools in Hong Kong have already switched to online learning and lessons by conference call, with assignments given out on a daily or weekly basis. The outbreak has triggered fresh tensions between the government and residents, many of who have called for full closure of the border with mainland China. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has closed some cross-border links but has said completely sealing it would be inappropriate, impractical and discriminatory.

14 Feb 2020 09:58PM,Vietnam turns away two cruise ships over coronavirus fears,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners HANOI: Vietnam has denied two cruise ships permission to dock due to fears of coronavirus infections on board, Vietnamese state media and a cruise operator reported on Friday (Feb 14). One of the ships was now heading towards Thailand, where it would be allowed to dock, a Thai official said. Authorities in Vietnam's Quang Ninh province, home to the UNESCO world heritage site Ha Long Bay, decided on Tuesday (Feb 11) not to allow passengers of the German-owned AIDAvita cruise ship to disembark on Thursday, the state Vietnam News Agency (VNA) said. ""The vessel has docked in the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore, which have all reported coronavirus cases,"" VNA said. ""Not allowing AIDIvita's passengers to disembark (in Vietnam) is just a temporary solution to prevent the intrusion of diseases,"" VNA cited a local official as saying. Germany's AIDA Cruises, the owner of the AIDAvita, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. AIDA Cruises is a subsidiary of Miami-based Carnival Corp. The cruise liner left the Philippines port of Coron on Feb 10 bound for Vietnam via the South China Sea, according to data published by the Marine Traffic ship tracking website. It had been scheduled to visit Ha Long Bay, in northern Vietnam, on Saturday, then proceed to the Vietnamese ports of Da Nang, Nha Trang and Ho Chi Minh City from Feb 16 to Feb 20, according to CruiseMapper, a website which tracks cruise ships. As of Friday evening, the AIDAvita was 176 km south of the Thai capital Bangkok, according to Marine Traffic. It will dock at Laem Chabang on Friday night and health officials will board it on Saturday morning to examine passengers before allowing them to disembark, a Thai Marine Department spokeswoman said. VIETNAM 'UNREASONABLE' Stoking fears in countries that usually allow cruise ships to dock is the quarantine in Japan of the Diamond Princess, also managed by a unit of Carnival Corp. Of the 3,700 passengers and crew on that vessel, 218 have tested positive for the virus. Passengers on another Carnival Corp cruise ship, the MS Westerdam, spent two weeks at sea after being turned away by five countries, including Thailand, over coronavirus fears, before they began to disembark in Cambodia on Friday. The Norwegian Jade, operated by Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, was also denied permission to dock in Vietnam. ""Due to growing concerns regarding coronavirus in Asia, the ports we planned to visit in Vietnam are no longer open to accepting cruise ships,"" the Norwegian Cruise Line said. The ship had no cases of the virus, its captain Frank Juliussen said in a letter to passengers. ""There is no illness on board the ship and no guests or crew members on the ship who hold Chinese, Macau or Hong Kong passports or have visited or transited through any of these areas,"" the letter read. ""Still, the port has proven to be unreasonable during this process and late last night informed us that despite previously approving our calls and despite the actions we've taken to accommodate their new protocols, that they are denying our upcoming calls,"" Juliussen said, according to a copy of the letter posted on Twitter by a passenger. It was not known which Vietnamese port he was referring to. Norwegian Cruise Line did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment. Vietnamese port management authorities refused to comment and referred calls from Reuters to local port authorities in Vietnam, where telephone calls went unanswered. By Friday evening, the Norwegian Jade was heading for the port of Laem Chabang in Thailand, according to data on the Marine Traffic ship tracking website. Thailand's Marine Department did not name the Norwegian Jade as a ship that was docking. The coronavirus has killed more than 1,380 people, almost all in China where the outbreak originated, with one each in Hong Kong, the Philippines and Japan.

09 Feb 2020 07:40PM,"Church linked to possible coronavirus cluster engaged cleaning company to disinfect premises, will suspend meetings","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: A church linked to a possible coronavirus cluster in Singapore said on Sunday (Feb 9) that it has engaged a professional cleaning company to disinfect its entire premises and will suspend meetings for at least two weeks. “When the church got to know of the first case on Feb 7, right on the day itself, we engaged a professional cleaning company to disinfect our entire premises, using Ultima-S (410),” a spokesperson for The Life Church and Missions said in an email responding to CNA’s queries. The church has also decided to suspend meetings for at least two weeks and will monitor the situation to see if meetings have to be postponed even longer, it said. Five cases have been linked to the church, which is located at 146B Paya Lebar Road.   The figure includes a married couple from Wuhan (cases 8 and 9) as well as three Singaporeans (cases 31, 33 and 38) who had visited the church. The Ministry of Health announced on Feb 8 that cases 8, 9 and 33 had links to the church, following further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing. They include the married couple – both 56-year-old Chinese nationals from Wuhan – who arrived in Singapore together on Jan 19. The third case is a 39-year-old Singaporean woman who did not have recent travel history to China, but had been in Malaysia from Jan 22 to Jan 29. The other two Singaporeans – cases 31 and 38 – also have no recent travel history to China. But prior to hospital admission, both had been to The Life Church and Missions Singapore. The church premises has been closed to the general public since Friday. Only a few authorised personnel are allowed access, said the church spokesperson. The church has posted an advisory on its website and is assisting police with contact tracing. Its Sunday service was livestreamed to members and is available on Youtube. “When the church reopens for service again, we will abide by the advisory of MOH and perform temperature screening to look out for worshippers who may be feeling unwell. We will also prepare masks for those who have the need for them,” it said. “Our church will pray for those who are infected and those who are deeply concerned over the virus, and we also seek prayers from all to tide through this crisis together.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

10 Feb 2020 08:22PM,Singapore working with international body to develop vaccine for novel coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore is working “very closely” with an international body to deploy a vaccine against the novel coronavirus, said infectious diseases expert Wang Linfa on Monday (Feb 10). The Republic is working with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a public-private coalition created to develop vaccines to stop future epidemics. CEPI last week opened a call for proposals to rapidly develop and manufacture a vaccine that can be used against the novel coronavirus. Under the CEPI initiative, front runners will be chosen by the end of this week, and they will be given at least 16 weeks to develop the vaccine. It will be then decided if the vaccine is ready for a Phase 1 clinical trial. “We are trying to convince them to do a Phase 1 clinical trial in Singapore,” Professor Wang said. Prof Wang, director of the Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases at Duke-National University of Singapore (NUS) Medical School, was speaking at a media conference held at A*Star for scientists and researchers to share their work surrounding the novel coronavirus. However, the vaccine could take some time yet. Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, programme leader of Infectious Diseases at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School said it will take some time, “probably at least a year” before there is a vaccine that is commercially available. “That’s because the vaccine needs to be safe, it needs to be proven to be effective. Even if this outbreak is contained, which we all hope it will be, it will still be nice to have a vaccine, because at this point we don’t know if it will come back again,” he said. Prof Wang said that if the virus remains the way it is - with minimal change among the cases seen in different countries, the vaccine may be able to offer long-term protection. As of Monday, there were 45 confirmed cases of the virus in Singapore. There are more than 40,000 infected around the world, mostly in mainland China, and more than 900 have died from the disease. LOOKING FOR MEDICINES THAT WORK In the meantime, a few patients here have been given a drug typically used to treat the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), said Associate Professor David Lye, director at the Infectious Disease Research and Training Office at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). When patients are given HIV medication, medical professionals look out for whether their oxygen requirement improves, whether their fever subsides, and whether their swabs come back negative for the coronavirus, he said. “With the small number of patients and with people reporting their use in other countries in small numbers without detailed data, it’s very hard to say whether they work or not. Our experience is that in some patients, we see a very rapid response. ""But we also see people who continue to worsen and require assistance to breathe through a machine,” he said. Assoc Prof Lye, who is in the World Health Organization’s protocol writing committee, is involved in designing a study to test the efficacy of existing medication against the novel coronavirus. “The experts are working very hard to develop protocol, we are discussing how to design the study, what sort of patients do we include? If they are patients without symptoms, but they are positive, do you give them potentially drugs with side effects?"" The sort of drugs to be used is also being debated, he added. A drug tested for Ebola seemed to have “very good activity” for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the novel coronavirus in animal models, although it has not been used to treat the novel coronavirus in humans, he said. “We need to be part of an international collaboration because there’s nothing worse than having a very small study and giving the wrong results,” he said. NCID executive director Leo Yee Sin said that patients are being given supportive treatment in the meantime. “This means making sure hydration and nutrition are maintained. If lung is the primary organ infected, you want to make sure that they have enough capacity to maintain a good oxygen level,” she said. Assoc Prof Lye stressed the importance of an international study. “We cannot be like in Severe Acute Respiratory Sydrome (SARS) time when we just used trial and error.” “We hope to bring to our Singapore patients a proper randomised controlled trial very very soon,” he said.

06 Feb 2020 02:22PM,What we know about the 5 families among Singapore's confirmed coronavirus cases,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: At least 12 people from five families, including a foreign domestic helper, are among the confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in Singapore so far. Of these, six are linked to the country’s first cluster of local transmission announced by authorities earlier this week. This includes the youngest patient in Singapore to date - a six-month-old baby boy who is the child of an infected couple.   Singapore had 28 confirmed cases as of Wednesday (Feb 5). Here’s what we know about these families: FAMILY 1: CASES 1 AND 3 WHO: Father, 66, and son, 37, from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore with seven other travelling companions on Jan 20. DETAILS: The 66-year-old – Singapore’s first case of the virus confirmed on Jan 23 – reported having a sore throat while on his flight to Singapore. He developed a fever the next day and began coughing. After arriving in Singapore, the man checked in to Shangri-La’s Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa. On Jan 22, he told hotel staff that he was unwell and was taken to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH), where he was isolated and diagnosed with pneumonia. He was identified to the Ministry of Health (MOH) as a suspected case at 10pm and was tested positive the following day at 6pm. He remains in isolation at SGH. The man’s son, who stayed with his father at the same hotel, became a confirmed case on Jan 24. He is also currently in isolation at SGH. Other family members travelling alongside the father and son – the wives of both men and the son’s two young children – have also come down with the infectious virus. They were among Malaysia’s first few confirmed cases after they left Singapore for Johor Bahru at about 12pm on Jan 23, before the 66-year-old man was confirmed as infected with the virus later that day. FAMILY 2: CASES 8 AND 9 WHO: A married couple – both 56-year-old Chinese nationals from Wuhan – who arrived in Singapore together on Jan 19. DETAILS: Both cases did not show symptoms during their flight to Singapore. They only developed symptoms on Jan 24 and the couple took a taxi to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) three days later. They were classified as suspect cases and placed in isolation at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). Tests confirmed the couple as having the coronavirus on Jan 28 and Jan 29. Before that, the couple had stayed with their family at their home at Lorong Lew Lian in Upper Serangoon.   FAMILY 3: CASES 13 AND 26 WHO: Mother, 73, and daughter, 42, from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore on Jan 21. DETAILS: The 73-year-old woman was a close contact of the country’s second confirmed case – a 53-year-old woman from Wuhan who also arrived in Singapore on Jan 21. The elderly woman was located on Jan 28 after MOH made multiple attempts to contact her, and she reported having developed symptoms on the same day. She was then taken to NCID, where she was isolated. She was confirmed as the 13th infected case on Jan 30. The woman had stayed at ParkRoyal Collection Pickering and Oasia Hotel Downtown, and visited Changi Airport and Jewel. She travelled by taxi and private transport. Her daughter was confirmed as being infected with the coronavirus on Feb 4. The 42-year-old had been taken by ambulance to NCID on the same day as her mother on Jan 28 after developing symptoms. She remains warded in an isolation room at NCID. FAMILY 4: CASES 24 AND 25 WHO: A married couple with no recent travel history to China. The wife is a 32-year-old female Singapore resident and her husband, 40, is a Singapore citizen. They are among the locally-transmitted cases linked to a Chinese tour group that visited health products shop Yong Thai Hang in Cavan Road. DETAILS: The 32-year-old works as a tour guide and has brought groups of tourists to Yong Thai Hang. She had gone to NCID on Feb 3 with no symptoms – although she “subsequently informed NCID on (Tuesday) night that she had developed a fever on Jan 30”, according to MOH – and was confirmed positive on Feb 4 at about 2pm. Prior to admission to NCID, the tour guide stayed at her home at Buangkok Green and worked at Jalan Besar. She had visited Hougang Polyclinic on Jan 30 and went to a supermarket near her home. Her husband was also tested positive on Feb 4. The 40-year-old man had developed a fever on Jan 24. He visited the same polyclinic as his wife on Jan 30, and self-presented at NCID four days later where he was immediately isolated. Prior to being admitted, the man had stayed at home. He worked at Diamond Industries Jewellery Company at Harbour Drive, which the tour group from China had visited as well. He had also visited Pasir Panjang Hawker Centre and travelled by public transport. Both are currently warded in isolation rooms at NCID. FAMILY 5: CASES 19, 21, 27 AND 28 WHO: A family of three – a 28-year-old female Singapore resident, a 45-year-old male Singapore citizen and a six-month-old baby boy – and their foreign domestic helper who are all linked to the first local transmission cluster. All four do not have recent travel history to China. DETAILS: The 28-year-old – case 19 – works as a salesperson at Yong Thai Hang and reported having a sore throat and fever on Jan 29. She sought treatment at a GP clinic on the same day. The following day, she went to TTSH’s emergency department and was discharged after a chest X-ray came back negative for pneumonia. She did not leave her home at Jalan Bukit Merah from Jan 31 to Feb 2. On Feb 3, she was admitted to SGH and tested positive for the novel coronavirus on the same day. She is currently warded in an isolation room at SGH. Her husband and son – cases 27 and 28 – were announced to have come down with the novel coronavirus on Feb 5. The former is currently warded at the NCID, while their six-month-old baby boy is now in an isolation room at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. Both are in stable condition. In an update on Feb 6, MOH said that the husband had developed symptoms on Feb 1 and visited a GP clinic the next day. He was subsequently isolated at the NCID. Prior to hospital admission, he stayed at his home at Jalan Bukit Merah and worked as a private hire driver, the health ministry said. He also visited Tiong Bahru Plaza, Tiong Bahru Market and Beo Crescent Market and Food Centre. In response to media queries, MOH said the six-month-old baby boy was not in any infant care facility prior to hospital admission, and was cared for at home. The family’s foreign domestic helper has also come down with the virus. The 44-year-old Indonesian woman – case 21 – reported onset of symptoms on Feb 2 and did not leave her place of residence at Jalan Bukit Merah. She was admitted to SGH on Feb 3 and tested positive the next day. Separately, a colleague of the 28-year-old salesperson is also warded with the virus at NCID.   MORE ABOUT TOUR GROUP THAT VISITED YONG THAI HANG There are now seven people infected by the coronavirus in Singapore's first cluster of local transmission, which is linked to a Chinese tour group that visited Yong Thai Hang in Cavan Road last month. The shop is a complementary health products shop that primarily serves Chinese tourists, MOH said. The tour group of 20 had arrived in Singapore on Jan 22 and left for Malaysia on Jan 24. They later came back to Singapore at about 3am on Jan 27, before leaving the country at about 6am. Two among the tour group have tested positive for the virus, MOH said on Feb 5 citing confirmation from Chinese health authorities. Besides Yong Thai Hang and Diamond Industries Jewellery Company, the group also visited various spots in Singapore, such as Meeting You Restaurant in Hamilton Road, Royal Dragon Restaurant in Havelock Road, T Galleria by DFS in Scotts Road and the D’Resort @ Downtown East in Pasir Ris.   MOH said it has been almost 14 days since the tourists visited these places. It has reached out to 142 contacts, of which “all but one are well”. “The person has been isolated as a suspect case and test results are pending,” authorities said. Contact tracing was also conducted for the crew and passengers of the departing flight on Jan 27. Five are in Singapore and have been quarantined.

CASE 44 Case 44 is a 37-year-old Singaporean man who lives at Sembawang Drive and works at the Certis Cisco Centre at 20 Jalan Afifi in Paya Lebar. He has no recent travel history to China. He reported the onset of symptoms on Jan 31, and sought treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 2. He went to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital on Feb 6, where he was isolated and warded. He tested positive for the coronavirus on Feb 9. Before having symptoms, he served quarantine orders on two people from Wuhan who subsequently tested positive for the infection. After the onset of symptoms, he did not serve any quarantine orders. Prior to being admitted to hospital, he had been on duty at Chingay 2020. Chingay took place on Jan 31 and Feb 1. Certis said in a statement it is helping the authorities with their investigations and providing ""all necessary assistance"" to the employee and his family. CNA has contacted Certis for more information. CASE 45 Case 45 is a two-year-old Singaporean girl. She was one of the 92 Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan on a Scoot flight on Jan 30. She did not have symptoms when she boarded the flight, and was placed under quarantine after landing in Singapore. She was referred to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital on Feb 7 based on initial test results and isolated. She was confirmed as having the infection on Feb 10. CONTACT TRACING As of noon on Monday, 581 of the suspect cases have tested negative for the novel coronavirus. Test results for the remaining 39 cases are pending. Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. As of Monday noon, MOH has identified 1,026 close contacts. Of the 927 who are still in Singapore, 896 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining 31 close contacts. The coronavirus epidemic has killed more than 900 people and infected more than 40,000, most of them in mainland China.

03 Feb 2020 07:52PM,No new cases of novel coronavirus in Singapore for second day running; total remains at 18,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: There are no new cases of the novel coronavirus in Singapore for the second day in a row, the Ministry of Health said on Monday (Feb 3) evening. None of the 18 previously announced cases are critically ill, and all of them remain in stable condition, MOH said, adding that most are improving. As of noon on Monday, 262 suspect cases have tested negative for the novel coronavirus, while test results for another 32 cases are pending. The ministry said that it has identified 256 close contacts of the 18 cases. Of the 187 who are still in Singapore, 186 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. ""Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining close contact,"" MOH added. The number of total infections in China's coronavirus outbreak has passed 17,200 nationwide, the National Health Commission said on Monday. In its daily update, the commission said there had been 57 new deaths from the virus - all in hardest-hit Hubei province except one, bringing the national toll to 361. The 18th confirmed case in Singapore is a 31-year-old Chinese woman who arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 22. She was a travelling companion of the 12th confirmed case. The 17th case, a 47-year-old woman, is one of the Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30. She was asymptomatic when she boarded the flight but was found to have a fever during medical screening upon her arrival at Changi Airport. Singapore on Friday announced that it will widen travel restrictions to include all new visitors with recent travel history to China. The expanded measures started at 11.59pm on Saturday. As of 1pm on Sunday, the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) refused entry to 15 travellers into Singapore, due to either their travel histories to mainland China in the last 14 days, or suspension of visa facilities. On Saturday, authorities began distributing packs of four surgical masks for each Singapore household. There have been long queues for masks at pharmacies and retailers across the country. Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing on Sunday also said that the impact of the Wuhan coronavirus situation could be ""wider, deeper and longer"" than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003.

12 Feb 2020 11:27AM,New coronavirus cases lowest since Jan but experts disagree over peak,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: China reported on Wednesday (Feb 12) its lowest number of new coronavirus cases since January, lending weight to a prediction by its senior medical adviser that the outbreak could end by April. International experts, however, remain alarmed by the spread of the flu-like virus which has now killed more than 1,100 people, all but two in mainland China. China's foremost medical adviser on the outbreak, Zhong Nanshan, said on Tuesday numbers of new cases were falling in some provinces and forecast the epidemic would peak this month. ""I hope this outbreak or this event may be over in something like April,"" Zhong, an epidemiologist whose previous forecast of an earlier peak turned out to be premature, told Reuters.  Total infections in China have hit 44,653, say health officials, including 2,015 new confirmed cases on Tuesday. That was the lowest daily rise in new cases since Jan. 30. The number of deaths on the mainland rose by 97 to 1,113 by the end of Tuesday. But doubts have been aired on social media about how reliable the figures are, after the government last week amended guidelines on the classification of cases. While Chinese officials said the situation was under control, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the epidemic posed a global threat potentially worse than terrorism. The world must ""wake up and consider this enemy virus as public enemy number one,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters on Tuesday, adding the first vaccine was 18 months away. Asked about Zhong's prediction, Australia's chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said: ""I think it's far too premature to say that."" ""I think we've just got to watch the data very closely over the coming weeks before we make any predictions,"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corp on Wednesday, while praising China's ""Herculean efforts"" to contain the virus.   Hundreds of cases have been reported in dozens of countries and territories around the world, including one fatality in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines. The biggest cluster of cases outside of China was aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined off the Japanese port of Yokohama with about 3,700 people on board. Japanese officials on Wednesday said another 39 people had tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the total to 175. One of the new cases was a quarantine officer. Thailand said it was barring passengers from another cruise ship, MS Westerdam, from disembarking, the latest country to turn it away amid fears of the coronavirus, despite no confirmed infections on board. ""BATTLE THAT MUST BE WON"" Echoing the WHO's comparison with the fight against terrorism, China's state news agency Xinhua said in an article published late on Tuesday the epidemic was a ""battle that has no gunpowder smoke but must be won"". It warned the epidemic was a ""big test of China's governance system and capabilities"" and said some officials were still ""dropping the ball"" in places where it was most severe. ""This is a wake-up call for us,"" it said. Hubei's government dismissed the provincial health commission's Communist Party boss, state media said on Tuesday, amid mounting public anger over local authorities' handling of the crisis. China's censors had allowed criticism of local officials but have begun cracking down on reporting of the outbreak, issuing reprimands to tech firms that gave free rein to online speech, according to Chinese journalists. DEALS ON HOLD The pathogen has been officially named COVID-19 - CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for the year it emerged. The virus emerged from an illegal wildlife market in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan in December. The city of 11 million people remains under virtual lockdown and other Chinese cities resemble ghost towns due to travel restrictions which have paralysed the world's second-biggest economy. World stocks, which had seen rounds of sell-offs over the coronarvirus' impact on China's economy and its ripple effects, surged to record highs on Zhong's comments. The Dow industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all hit new peaks. Asian shares and Wall Street futures nudged higher on Wednesday amid hopes the worst of the coronavirus in China may have passed. Even if the epidemic ends soon, it has already taken a toll on China's economy, as companies began laying off workers and other firms said they would need loans running into billions of dollars to stay afloat. Supply chains for car manufacturers to smartphone makers have broken down.   Bankers in Asia are bracing for a deal drought as key meetings and roadshows are put on hold. ""All our deals are on hold now - capital markets or M&A. Nothing is happening,"" said a Hong Kong-based senior investment banker with a Wall Street bank. White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien said the coronavirus outbreak could reduce Chinese purchases of American agricultural products this year under the US-China Phase 1 trade deal. ANZ Bank said China’s first-quarter growth would probably slow to 3.2 per cent to 4 per cent, down from a projection of 5 per cent. China will stagger the re-opening of schools to stave off virus risks, a government official said.

11 Feb 2020 08:00PM,"2 new coronavirus cases in Singapore, including second Bangladeshi worker and RWS casino employee","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore reported two more confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus on Tuesday (Feb 11), said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update. One had worked at the same location as another Bangladeshi coronavirus patient, the other is a Singapore permanent resident (PR) who lives in Johor Bahru and works at Resorts World Sentosa Casino. This brings the number of cases in Singapore to 47, with seven in critical condition. Two more patients - cases 17 and 36 - were discharged from hospital on Tuesday, meaning nine have now fully recovered from the virus. Case 17 was a 47-year-old Singaporean woman who was among the Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30. Case 36 was a 38-year-old Singapore permanent resident who had attended a business meeting at Grand Hyatt Singapore, that has been linked to several cases overseas. A total of 25 cases in Singapore are local transmissions.   Case 46 Case 46 is a 35-year-old male Singapore PR who lives in Johor Bahru and works at Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) Casino. He does not have any recent travel history to China. He reported having symptoms on Feb 5 and sought treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 9. He was taken by ambulance to Tan Tock Seng Hospital on the same day and isolated. Test results confirmed he had the infection the next day on Feb 10. Prior to admission, he had gone to work at the casino. He is currently isolated at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). Responding to queries from CNA, RWS said that it has identified an unspecified number of employees who had recent contact with the employee and instructed them to go on 14 days of leave of absence. RWS will work closely with MOH to monitor their condition, said a spokesperson. ""Deep cleaning, thorough disinfection and sanitisation have been carried out at all areas and touchpoints where the employee had come into contact with,"" said the spokesperson. RWS did not provide details on what role the employee held at the casino as well as how many visitors or colleagues he may have had contact with. Case 47 Case 47 is a 39-year-old male Bangladeshi worker. He had worked at 10 Seletar Aerospace Heights, said MOH, the same location as another infected Bangladeshi worker, Singapore's 42nd case, who was confirmed as having the virus on Feb 8. The man, who has no recent travel history to China, reported feeling ill on Feb 6 and sought treatment at a general practitioner clinic the next day. He went to NCID on Feb 10, where he was confirmed as a positive case. Prior to being hospitalised, he had gone to work and stayed at his rental apartment at Veerasamy Road. Bombardier, the company located at 10 Seletar Aerospace Heights, confirmed in a statement to CNA that the two workers had worked with a third-party contractor at its Singapore Service Centre expansion sites, which are at 8 Seletar Aerospace Heights and 12 Seletar Aerospace Heights. They are not employees of Bombardier. The two men had worked on different buildings on the expansion sites and never had access to the company's existing facility, said Bombardier. No cases of the virus have been reported among employees at its service centre at 10 Seletar Aerospace Heights. It is collaborating with the Health Ministry to ensure that the necessary health protocols are followed, it said. ""The health and safety of our employees is always a top priority at Bombardier, and out of an abundance of caution, Bombardier continues to take the necessary steps to ensure its operations and employees remain safe,"" said a company spokesperson. CONTACT TRACING As of noon on Tuesday, 608 of the suspect cases have tested negative for the novel coronavirus. Test results for the remaining 43 cases are pending. Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. MOH has identified 1,124 close contacts. Of the 1,021 who are still in Singapore, 989 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining 32 close contacts.  The total number of fatalities from the epidemic in China jumped past 1,000 on Tuesday after 108 new deaths, including 103 in the hard-hit Hubei province. Singapore last week raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange, prompting additional precautionary measures. The coronavirus outbreak is expected to take a toll on the tourism sector, with the Singapore Tourism Board on Tuesday saying visitor arrivals are estimated to fall by 25 per cent to 30 per cent this year. South Korea and Israel have told their citizens to defer travel to Singapore, while Indonesia and Taiwan have recommended precautions be taken when visiting the country. Members of the public have voiced concern over Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) in-camp training, but Senior Minister of State for Defence Heng Chee How on Tuesday said there were no plans to cancel training amid the outbreak.

01 Feb 2020 10:11AM,"Wuhan coronavirus: Singapore Airshow organiser 'undoubtedly' expects fewer exhibitors, visitors","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: This year's Singapore Airshow is expected to see fewer exhibitors and visitors as the country implements more stringent measures to contain the deadly Wuhan coronavirus, its organiser said. In response to queries by CNA, Experia Events said the event will continue as planned from Feb 11 to 16 with the additional measures implemented. ""While we continue to monitor the situation closely, the current expanded measures will undoubtedly see a reduction in terms of the number of expected exhibitors and visitors this year,"" it said on Friday (Jan 31) evening. ""During this period, we are working to ensure the relevant parties receive the requisite support and assurance, and remain ready and prepared to implement further enhanced measures as required by the authorities."" This comes after the Government announced on Friday that new visitors of any nationality with recent travel history to mainland China will not be allowed entry or transit in Singapore. Previously, only those with recent travel history to Hubei province were subjected to these restrictions. In addition, those with Chinese passports, with the exception of Singapore permanent residents and long-term pass holders, will not be allowed to enter Singapore. Authorities will also stop issuing all forms of new visas and suspend previously issued short-term and multiple-visit visas for those with Chinese passports. Those who hold such visas will not be allowed into Singapore. The multi-ministry task force tackling the outbreak said these measures will help prevent community spread in Singapore, hours before the Ministry of Health announced the country's three latest confirmed cases of the virus. Sixteen people in Singapore now have the Wuhan coronavirus, including a 47-year-old Singaporean who had travelled to Wuhan with her family and was one of the 92 Singaporeans who were evacuated from the city on Thursday. ""In line with the Ministry of Health announcement ... Experia Events will inform our exhibitors and visitors of the expanded measures,"" it said. ""As the well-being of visitors to the Singapore Airshow 2020 is our utmost priority, we urge visitors who feel unwell to seek medical attention promptly and not to attend the event for the welfare of all other visitors."" The organiser had earlier said in an advisory that it will improve housekeeping and refuse management protocols to maintain ""high standards"" of hygiene at the event, adding that doctors and medics will be on standby to attend to visitors who are unwell. The biennial Singapore Airshow, billed as Asia's largest defence and aerospace exhibition, attracted 80,000 visitors over a weekend in 2018, including 54,000 trade attendees from 147 countries and regions. Expected exhibitors at this year's event include the China Aviation Industrial Base and the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China. The previous edition had attracted manufacturers of commercial and military jets as well as specialists in aviation training from China. In 2018, Experia Events said exhibitors, trade attendees, visitors and tourists spent more than S$343 million on flights, accommodation, exhibition space, entertainment, shopping and food and beverages, a four per cent increase from 2016. The organiser said it will provide updates on implementing additional measures as required by the authorities in the lead up to this year's event.

07 Feb 2020 11:01PM,"Melco abandons Crown stake purchase, first major deal dropped due to coronavirus","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners HONG KONG: The coronavirus epidemic has claimed its first big M&A deal, with Macau casino operator Melco Resorts & Entertainment pulling the plug on a stake purchase in Australia's Crown Resorts, citing a plunge in traveller numbers and casino closures. Macau, the world's biggest gambling hub, has ordered casino operators to suspend operations for two weeks in a bid to limit the spread of the virus - a decision analysts say is likely to lead to months of cashflow bleed across the industry. A slew of flight cancellations due to the virus has hit tourism in the region while the closure of stores and factories is also pounding business activity in China, a key source of international gamblers. The developments were seen as the last straw for Melco's planned purchase of a second 9.99 per cent stake in Crown from billionaire James Packer. The total planned acquisition of a 19.99 per cent holding was valued at A$1.76 billion (US$1.2 billion) when it was announced last May. Even before the virus, the deal had raised regulatory concerns over links with Stanley Ho, father of Melco owner Lawrence Ho. Stanley Ho was previously under investigation by authorities in Australia and the United States for possible ties to organised crime. Then in August, Packer froze the sale of the second tranche pending an investigation into alleged criminal activity at Crown's Australian operations. ""Any further acquisition of Crown would have likely been a bigger bite than Melco could reasonably handle. The reining in of what was beginning to look like an empire build should be looked on favorably by Melco shareholders,"" said Vitaly Umansky, analyst at Sanford C Bernstein in Hong Kong. Melco also shelved plans for a seat on Crown's board and analysts said it is likely to divest its current 9.99 per cent holding in the future. Blaming the epidemic, which has killed more than 630, for its decision, Melco said in a statement it wants to focus on its core investments. Melco makes around 90 per cent of its revenue in Macau, which has confirmed 10 cases of infection. It also has operations in Manila and Cyprus and is vying for a casino license in Japan, which executives are touting as the biggest market outside of Macau in Asia. Crown, which reports half-yearly earnings on Feb 19, unveiled a major management shake-up last month which included filling its chief executive post that had been vacant for about three years. Its shares ended flat on Friday (Feb 7).

02 Feb 2020 11:15PM,Afghanistan seeks to quarantine any coronavirus cases,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners KABUL: Afghan health authorities are establishing isolation wards across the country ahead of a potential influx of coronavirus cases, an official said Sunday (Feb 2), as governments worldwide monitor the disease's spread. No cases have been recorded in Afghanistan so far, and the war-torn country's health services have set up screening units at airports and borders, public health minister Ferozuddin Feroz said. ""We have put serious measures in place,"" Feroz told reporters. He said that in Kabul, authorities have created a 100-bed isolation ward, and another 200 or so beds will be made available across the country in Afghanistan's creaking hospitals. Feroz said 262 people - including 233 Afghans - who flew into Kabul's airport from China during the past week had all been screened, and health officials have remained in contact with them to check on their health. Shanghai University student Nezamuddin Nekzad, who spoke to reporters at the airport after arriving home from China, said he had decided to return to Afghanistan because life had become fairly restrictive in Shanghai. ""We couldn't go outside and stayed at home,"" Nekzad said. It was ""a little bit difficult to find food, so we (came back) to our country."" About 40 Afghan students are currently in Wuhan - the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak in China. Feroz said the Afghan government had a chartered plane at the ready to bring them home if needed. Coronavirus is similar to the SARS pathogen and has killed more than 300 people in China and spread around the world since emerging in Wuhan. On Sunday, China's National Health Commission said more than 14,000 people have been infected by the novel coronavirus. Outside mainland China, there have been more than 100 infections reported in more than 20 countries. The World Health Organization has declared an international emergency over the outbreak.

09 Feb 2020 07:09AM,China's coronavirus deaths surpass SARS as millions stagger back to work,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The number of confirmed infections in China's coronavirus outbreak has reached 37,198 nationwide with more than 2,600 new cases reported, the National Health Commission said on Sunday (Feb 9). In its daily update, the commission said there had been 89 new deaths from the virus - with 81 in hardest-hit Hubei province, and the rest in other regions - bringing the national toll to 811. The death toll is now higher than the global number of deaths caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, which killed 774 people in 2002-2003. Authorities had told businesses to tack up to 10 extra days onto holidays that had been due to finish at the end of January as the rising numbers of dead and infected cast a pall over the country. Many of China's usually teeming cities have almost become ghost towns during the past two weeks as Communist Party rulers ordered virtual lockdowns, cancelled flights, closed factories and shut schools. The sight of an economy regarded as a workshop to the world laid so low has taken a toll on international financial markets, as shares slumped and investors switched into safe-havens like gold, bonds and the Japanese yen. Even on Monday, a large number of workplaces and schools will remain closed and many white-collar employees will work from home. China has blocked a plan by Apple supplier Foxconn Technology to resume production in China from Monday, the Nikkei business daily reported. Gaming giant Tencent Holdings Ltd said on Sunday it had asked staff to continue working from home until Feb 21. Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, will keep schools shut until Mar 1, the People's Daily newspaper said. Several provinces have shut schools until the end of February. NEW DEATHS, DISMAY, MISTRUST An American hospitalised in the central city of Wuhan in Hubei province, where the outbreak began, became the first confirmed non-Chinese victim of the disease. The Washington Post identified him as Hong Ling, a 53-year old geneticist who studied rare diseases at Berkeley. A Japanese man who also died in Wuhan was another suspected victim. As millions of Chinese prepared to go back to work, the public dismay and mistrust of official numbers was evident on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. ""What's even more frustrating is that these are only the 'official' data,"" said one user. ""Don't say anything else. We all know we can't purchase masks anywhere, why are we still going back to work?"" said a second. ""More than 20,000 doctors and nurses around the country have been sent to Hubei, but why are the numbers still rising?"" asked a third. UNREPORTED CASES Among the latest deaths, 81 were in Hubei, where the virus has infected most people by far. New deaths in Wuhan, Hubei's capital, saw a rare decline. New infection cases on Saturday recorded the first drop since Feb 1, falling back below 3,000 to 2,656 cases. Of those, 2,147 cases were in Hubei. Total confirmed coronavirus cases in China stood at 37,198, commission data showed. Joseph Eisenberg, professor of epidemiology at the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan, said it was too early to say whether the epidemic was peaking. ""Even if reported cases might be peaking, we don't know what is happening with unreported cases,"" he said. ""This is especially an issue in some of the more rural areas."" The virus has spread to 27 countries and regions, according to a Reuters count based on official reports, infecting more than 330 people. Two deaths have been reported outside mainland China - in Hong Kong and the Philippines. Both victims were Chinese nationals. ALARM IN EUROPE, UNITED STATES AND ASIA Major cities and capitals announced new travel restrictions as concern over the spread of the virus increased. Hong Kong introduced a two-week quarantine on Saturday for all people arriving from the mainland, or who have been there during the previous 14 days. Malaysia expanded its ban on visitors from China. France issued a new travel advisory for its citizens, saying it did not recommend travelling to China unless there was an ""imperative"" reason. Italy asked children travelling from China to stay away from school for two weeks voluntarily. The latest patients outside China include five British nationals staying in the same chalet at a ski village in Haute-Savoie in the Alps, French health officials said, raising fears of further infections at a busy period in the ski season. Britain's final evacuation flight from Wuhan, landed at a Royal Air Force base in central England on Sunday with 200 people on board and a plane with 266 evacuees landed on Sunday in Darwin, Australia, SBS broadcaster said. Singapore also organised a second evacuation flight for 174 Singaporeans and their family members in Wuhan. The country has reported 40 cases of coronavirus, putting it among the hardest hit countries, along with Japan, outside of China. On Sunday, Singapore's central bank advised financial institutions to step up precautions for staff, after the Government raised its response to the virus on Friday to Orange. Organisers of the Singapore Airshow 2020 expect this week's event to draw less than half the crowd seen on public days at the last show in 2018.

13 Feb 2020 11:41AM,Japan to let elderly leave cruise liner hit by coronavirus as 44 new cases confirmed,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TOKYO: Another 44 people on board a cruise ship moored off Japan's coast have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, the country's health minister said Thursday (Feb 13). Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said the 44 new cases were from another 221 new tests. They raise the number of infections detected on the Diamond Princess to 218, in addition to a quarantine officer who also tested positive for the coronavirus. Kato said authorities now want to move elderly people off the ship if they test negative for the virus, offering to put them in government-designated lodging. ""We wish to start the operation from tomorrow or later,"" Kato told reporters.   Kato added that elderly passengers who have pre-existing conditions or are in windowless rooms would be allowed to leave starting from Friday, rather than the originally targeted date of Feb 19, and complete their quarantine ashore. About 80 per cent of the ship passengers were aged 60 or over, with 215 in their 80s and 11 in their 90s, according to Japanese media. ""We will make every effort to ensure the safety and peace of mind of the people,"" Kato told a televised news conference, without confirming the number of passengers who may leave ahead of schedule. Those who had been in close contact with persons who tested positive would not be allowed to leave the ship, he said. The Diamond Princess has been moored off Japan since Feb 3, after it emerged that a former passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong last month had tested positive for the virus now named COVID-19. Of the newly diagnosed infections, 43 are passengers, and one a member of the crew. The ship was placed into quarantine shortly afterwards and authorities have asked passengers and crew to remain on board until Feb 19.   Those who have tested positive for the new virus have been taken off the ship to medical facilities, but questions have been raised about whether the quarantine on the ship is working, with dozens of new cases diagnosed almost daily. Passengers are confined to cabins and required to wear masks and keep their distance from each other when they are allowed out for brief periods on open decks.

11 Feb 2020 07:31AM,"China coronavirus death toll passes 1,000","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The number of fatalities from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,016 nationwide on Tuesday (Feb 11) after 108 new deaths, including 103 in the hard-hit Hubei province. The other deaths were in the provinces of Heilongjiang, Anhui and Henan and the cities of Tianjin and Beijing, the National Health Commission said. The commission said there were another 2,478 new confirmed cases on the mainland on Monday, down from 3,062 on the previous day and bringing the accumulated total to 42,638. This includes the 2,097 new cases reported in Hubei province, where the outbreak emerged in December. The new virus is believed to have emerged last year in a market that sells wild animals in Hubei's capital Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak. Chinese President Xi Jinping met with medical workers and patients affected at a hospital in Beijing on Monday, where he called for ""more decisive measures"" to contain the outbreak, said state broadcaster CCTV. An advance team for a World Health Organization-led international expert mission on the virus arrived in China late Monday, headed by Bruce Aylward. He oversaw the organization's 2014-2016 response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. Ahead of the team's arrival, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned there had been some ""concerning instances"" of cases overseas in people with no travel history to China. Britain on Monday recorded a doubling of cases to eight, and the government warned the outbreak of novel coronavirus was a ""serious and imminent threat."" US President Donald Trump said he expected the outbreak would disappear in April due to hotter weather, a prognosis at odds with top US health officials.

12 Feb 2020 03:19PM,"DBS employee infected with novel coronavirus, some staff told to work from home","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: DBS on Wednesday (Feb 12) confirmed an employee had been infected with the novel coronavirus, prompting the bank to take precautionary measures and have some employees at Marina Bay Financial Centre work from home. The infected employee was tested on Tuesday and the bank was informed of the confirmation on Wednesday morning, said DBS in a media statement. As a precaution, employees in the affected office space were told to work from home. ""As a precautionary measure, as at 12pm today, we ensured that all employees on the affected floor at Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 3 vacated the premises, to work from home,"" it said. The bank said it was conducting contact tracing with all employees and other people the infected person may have come into contact with.   The affected office space and common areas are being deep cleaned and disinfected according to the health ministry's guidelines, it added. ""During this difficult time, the bank will be providing this employee and his family with every support and guidance,"" said DBS. A total of 300 staff members at level 43 of the Marina Bay Financial Centre have been ""evacuated"" as a precautionary measure and will work from home, the bank told staff members in an internal memo seen by CNA. CARE PACKS TO INCLUDE VITAMIN C, THERMOMETER All bank employees will receive a ""personal hygiene and protection care pack with effect from next week. The pack will include a thermometer, hand sanitiser and vitamin C, said DBS. It said it was also rolling out webinars for medical health professionals to update employees and provide further information, and also had a medical helpline and services to virtual doctors. The bank has also put in place plans for employees to work from home or from split sites ""to ensure minimal disruption to operations"". Long lines had formed this week to enter some offices in the financial district as employers started screening workers for temperature. Warnings by building management of cases in some downtown office buildings have also been widely shared on social media. A total of 47 people have tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Singapore so far. As of Tuesday, nine of these have since recovered. The virus, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 20 countries. More than 1,000 people have died and more than 44,000 people have been infected, the vast majority in China.

13 Feb 2020 09:42AM,Cruise ship shunned over coronavirus fears arrives in Cambodia,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia: A US cruise ship blocked from several Asian ports over concerns that a passenger could have been infected with the new coronavirus arrived off Cambodia Thursday (Feb 13), as frustrated holidaymakers expressed hope that their ordeal may soon be over. The Westerdam was supposed to be taking its 1,455 passengers on a dream 14-day cruise around east Asia, beginning in Hong Kong on Feb 1 and disembarking on Saturday in Yokohama, Japan. But the ship was turned away from Japan, Guam, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand over fears of the novel coronavirus epidemic that has killed more than 1,300 people in China. Cruise operator Holland America has insisted there are no cases of the SARS-like virus on board and Cambodia announced Wednesday the ship would be able to dock in Sihanoukville, on its southern coast. By morning, the ship could be seen on the horizon off Sihanoukville, dwarfing the small fishing vessels that usually ply the waters. ""First land sighting from the #Westerdam as the sun rises over Cambodia,"" passenger Christina Kerby tweeted. Doctors were conducting health checks for the passengers, said transport minister Sun Chanthol, adding that about 20 on board were sick. Their samples will be sent to the Pasteur Institute to test for the virus.  But ""actually they don't have symptoms of COVID-19. We just want to make sure that everything is ok,"" he told AFP. Cambodian premier Hun Sen is a staunch Chinese ally and has been vocal in his support of Beijing's handling of the epidemic, even going so far as to visit China last week in a show of solidarity. ""The permission to dock is to stop the disease of fear that is happening around the world,"" he told state-affiliated media website Fresh News on Wednesday. ""We must help them when they asked us for help,"" he added. Neighbouring Thailand, which blocked the Westerdam from docking in its eastern seaboard port, on Thursday received cruise liner Seabourne Ovation in holiday resort town Phuket. Another ship MV Quantum of the Seas is also scheduled to arrive Thursday.   Both ships were ""not at risk"", an official said, adding that health checks were done before passengers could disembark for 10 hours. ""The passengers and crew ... are European, which is different from MS Westerdam where there are some Chinese and Hong Kong passengers,"" deputy transport minister Atirat Ratanasate said in a Facebook post. Japan's premier Shinzo Abe expressed worries last week over a possible infection on the Westerdam, and said measures will be taken to ""reject entries"" for foreigners into the country. Cambodia, which has one confirmed case of the virus, is the recipient of billions of dollars in soft loans, infrastructure, and investment from China. Passenger Stephen Hansen earlier told AFP he was disappointed about Thailand rejecting the Westerdam but hoped that he would be able to disembark in Cambodia. ""Running out of countries to try!"" he said. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Copyright© Mediacorp 2020. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

05 Feb 2020 08:08AM,At least 10 on Japan cruise ship test positive for novel coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TOKYO: At least 10 passengers on a cruise ship that Japan quarantined tested positive for the new coronavirus, the Japanese health minister said on Wednesday (Feb 5). Japan has quarantined the vessel carrying 3,711 people and was testing those onboard the Diamond Princess for the virus after a former passenger was diagnosed with the illness in Hong Kong. Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told reporters that specimens from more than 200 people were collected. ""From around 7.30am (2230 GMT Tuesday), we had them (the 10 who tested positive) get off the vessel, and with cooperation with the coastguard we are sending them to medical organisations,"" he said. Health screening began on Tuesday for the passengers and crew after the Hong Kong passenger who sailed on the vessel last month tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The 80-year-old man flew to Japan and boarded the ship run by Carnival Japan in Yokohama on Jan 20 and disembarked in Hong Kong on Jan 25, the company said. Operator Princess Cruise Lines said around half the passengers on board the ship are Japanese but there were no immediate details on the nationalities of the other travellers. Of the 10 who tested positive, three are Japanese, three from Hong Kong, two Australian, one American and one Filipino crew member, the operator said. One Japanese man in his 70s told public broadcaster NHK that stricter quarantine measures came into force on Wednesday. ""Until yesterday, we were able to spend time in common spaces and do things like play ping-pong. But from this morning, we have not been allowed to go out of our rooms,"" said the man, who declined to be identified. ""I tried to go to a restaurant this morning for breakfast but I was told: 'Please eat in your room.' So I have been waiting for room service. But it hasn't arrived yet."" Kato appealed for the passengers and crew, who come from 56 countries, to cooperate with authorities, and said he assumed the quarantine would last around 14 days - the estimated maximum incubation period for the virus. One passenger said they will be confined to their cabins for the next two weeks. David Able, who is on the cruise with his wife celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary, told APTN the situation ""changed dramatically"" overnight with passengers being told they could not leave their rooms. ""We are quite fortunate that we have got a cabin with a balcony so we can open the door, get fresh air, if it's sunny, sit on the balcony,"" Able said. ""The people I feel really sorry for are those with inside cabins who've got no natural light, no fresh air. It's going to be pretty grim for them for two weeks,"" he added.   Japan was also preparing to expand the scope of its screening for the virus, and test criteria after initial tests failed to detect the virus in some people who were later found to be infected, the health minister told reporters. Previously, the country had 20 confirmed coronavirus cases, with 17 of them having been in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the epidemic began. Japan on Saturday began refusing entry to foreigners who have been in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, in the past 14 days as well as people with passports issued in Hubei province. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said he believed Japan's current restrictions on entry were appropriate, when asked at a news conference. Suga said that as of Feb 3, eight foreigners had been barred from entering Japan. Some countries including the United States and Australia have denied entry to all foreign nationals travelling from China.

12 Feb 2020 04:09PM,Discrimination of healthcare workers due to coronavirus ‘disgraceful’: Amrin Amin,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The discrimination of some healthcare workers due to suspicions of close contact with coronavirus cases is ""disgraceful"", Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Home Affairs Amrin Amin has said. “There's one issue that I would like to comment on, which is on discrimination faced by our healthcare officers,” he told reporters on Wednesday (Feb 12). “We have read reports of nurses being asked not to take the lift, take the stairs instead. Nurses have been asked to leave the train ... Ambulance drivers being asked not to buy food, so as not to contaminate others,"" said Mr Amrin. “These are very unfortunate incidents, and it's very disgraceful.” Mr Amrin’s comments came after several reports of healthcare workers being ostracised in public due to concerns over the new virus. “It does not reflect the best of us Singaporeans,” he continued. “In times or crisis, we must stand together and stand united, and these are people, ordinary men and women who have served Singapore in this time. “Some of them have volunteered their services, come in and stepped up. I think they deserve our support and encouragement. “I urge all Singaporeans to encourage them and to recognise their contributions in this moment.”   Mr Amrin urged Singaporeans to “condemn the disgraceful acts” by a minority, and make it clear that these acts do not represent Singaporeans. “We are better than that,” he added. “And we will show Singapore and the world who we really are.” Mr Amrin said the public should not be alarmed as all emergency medical crew will wear personal protective equipment when responding to all calls, not just suspected coronavirus cases. “The ambulance, after conveying a suspect case, will be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, so the public should rest assured,” he stated. Mr Amrin was speaking at the Singapore Civil Defence Force headquarters where he met frontline officers who had attended suspected coronavirus cases. “I'm here to say thank you to the men and women who have bravely served Singapore in this moment of need,” he said. “They have stepped up. Many of them have said they are also anxious, but despite that they continue to perform duties required of them and I think they deserve to be honoured.""

The entry ban will start on Tuesday, Yonhap reported, citing Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun. On Sunday, South Korea reported three new confirmed cases of the infection, bringing the total to 15 cases in the country. Earlier Sunday, the Philippines government reported the first Wuhan coronavirus death outside China. The death toll in China soared to 304 on Sunday, with authorities reporting 45 new deaths from the previous day. There were 2,590 new confirmed cases in China, bringing the total to more than 14,500. The WHO last week declared the outbreak a global health emergency. The Philippines announced it would immediately halt the arrivals of any foreign travellers from China. The United States, Australia and Israel have banned foreign nationals from visiting if they had been in China over the previous 14 days, and warned their own citizens from travelling there. Mongolia, Russia and Nepal closed their land borders, while Papua New Guinea went as far as to ban anyone arriving from ports or airports across Asia.

01 Feb 2020 07:35PM,"Wuhan coronavirus: 2 new imported cases, no evidence of community spread, says MOH","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Saturday (Feb 1) confirmed two additional imported cases of the Wuhan coronavirus, bringing the total to 18 cases. Both cases have recent travel history to Wuhan and there is currently no evidence of community spread in Singapore, MOH added. ""The two new cases are stable currently, and we are continuing to monitor their health. As for the 16 previously announced cases, none is critically ill. All of them remain in stable condition, and most are improving,"" MOH said. The 17th case is a 47-year-old female Singapore citizen who travelled to Wuhan. ""She was one of the Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30, and arrived in Singapore on the same day. She was asymptomatic when she boarded the flight. ""Upon arrival at Changi Airport, she was found to have a fever during medical screening, and was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID),"" MOH said. The woman then tested positive for Wuhan coronavirus infection on Jan 31 at about 11pm. She is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID. The 18th case is a 31-year-old female Chinese national who arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 22. She tested positive for infection on Feb 1 at about 2pm and is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID. MOH said that it has initiated epidemiological investigations and contact tracing to identify individuals who had close contact with the cases. In an update on the 16th confirmed case, which was announced on Jan 31, MOH said the 38-year-old male Chinese national arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 22. He is currently warded in an isolation room at the Singapore General Hospital. The man reported that he was asymptomatic during his flight to Singapore and subsequently developed symptoms on Jan 23. He reported that he had stayed at his home at Nathan Road until Jan 29, when he took a taxi to SGH. He was classified as a suspect case and immediately isolated. Subsequent test results confirmed 2019-nCoV infection on Jan 31 at about 2pm, MOH said.  As of 12pm on Feb 1, MOH said 231 of the suspect cases have tested negative for the Wuhan coronavirus. Test results for the remaining 25 cases are pending and contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once identified, MOH said it will closely monitor all close contacts and quarantine them for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient as a precautionary measure. All other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status. So far, MOH said it has identified 245 close contacts. Of the 177 who are still in Singapore, 172 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining five close contacts.  MOH also advised Singaporeans to defer all travel to Hubei province and all non-essential travel to mainland China. ""All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell. ""Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (eg. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit,"" MOH said.  MOH added that it will continue to monitor the situation closely. ""As medical practitioners are on the lookout for cases with pneumonia who have recently been in China, Singapore is likely to see more suspect cases that will need to be investigated."" Singapore on Friday announced that it will widen travel restrictions to include all new visitors with recent travel history to China. China also said it will send charter planes to bring home citizens from Hubei who are overseas ""as soon as possible"". The announcement came as a number of airlines, including Singapore Airlines and Scoot, announced they were halting or reducing flights to China as the country tackles the spread of the virus. In a bid to contain the possible spread of the virus, a total of 967 students and employees from schools in Singapore have been placed on leave of absence because of their recent travel history to China. On Saturday, authorities began distributing packs of four surgical masks for each Singapore household. There have been long queues for masks at pharmacies and retailers across the country.  Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing on Thursday reassured people that Singapore will have enough masks, provided the supply is managed ""appropriately"".

11 Feb 2020 06:00PM,No plans to cancel SAF in-camp training amid coronavirus concerns: Heng Chee How,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: There are no plans to cancel Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) in-camp training amid concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, Senior Minister of State for Defence Heng Chee How said on Tuesday (Feb 11). “We have to go back to the mission of the SAF and the defence of this country. We have to defend this country whether or not there is a virus situation,” he said. “That said, we must understand that when there is such a situation, we must take the necessary steps to safeguard the health of our soldiers. “This is exactly what we are doing – to make sure that both are top priorities.” The individual physical proficiency test (IPPT) will also not be cancelled at unit level.   “If they are sick, then they should let it be known so that we can then ask them not to undertake IPPT, (or) it can be rescheduled so that in the meantime you can seek treatment,” Mr Heng continued. Mr Heng was speaking to reporters at the Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC) on Pulau Tekong after observing stepped up measures against the virus outbreak. The centre, which currently has 5,000 recruits, has introduced measures like social distancing as well as increased frequency of cleaning and temperature-taking. This comes after some members of the public have written to the media urging ICTs to be suspended following local transmissions of the coronavirus.   “The very purpose of my visit today is indeed to give confidence to our soldiers and their families that there is no need to worry, that we understand the situation and that we have in place the measures, (which are) the same as those maintained on the mainland under the guidance of the MOH (Ministry of Health),” Mr Heng said. While Mr Heng stressed that BMTC does not have a confirmed case of the virus, he said suspected cases will be sent to the island’s medical centre, which has “exactly the same” standards and procedures as those adopted by MOH on the mainland. “If the doctor over here feels the patient fits the criteria that needs to be referred to the NCID (National Centre for Infectious Diseases), then that will be done,” he said. “Following that, we will do the necessary contact tracing as well as segregation of the close contacts for close monitoring.” SOCIAL DISTANCING The BMTC has also introduced staggered meal times and book-in and book-out timings to minimise interaction among servicemen. Each meal period has been divided into four timings to accommodate two companies of soldiers each. One company has 220 servicemen. Previously, more than four companies could eat during the same meal period.   BMTC has also cancelled or rescheduled physical activities where prolonged interaction is expected, like aqua jogging in the pool. In addition, it has deferred non-essential social activities like the recruits’ evening and external talks. Servicemen have been provided with stronger disinfectants like bleach and instructed to clean their bunks more frequently. SAF-chartered ferries and buses are also being cleaned more frequently. Similar measures have been implemented at all SAF camps. The centre is also considering reducing the number of public visitors at the next graduation parade in March and direct enlistment on Pulau Tekong in April.   During the H1N1 flu outbreak in 2009, BMTC reduced the number of visitors each servicemen could invite to their graduation parade from four to two. DORSCON ORANGE The measures come after Singapore on Friday raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange. The country has 45 confirmed cases of the coronavirus as of Monday. Under the new DORSCON level, organisers of large events should take necessary precautions such as carrying out temperature screening, looking out for respiratory symptoms like cough or runny nose, and denying entry to unwell individuals. BMTC has increased the frequency of temperature-taking for active personnel from once to at least twice a day.   It has also introduced an online health declaration form for visitors and contractors, with restrictions for those with recent travel to China. If the DORSCON level is raised to the maximum Red, the centre will align its measures with those introduced by the Ministry of Health. Mr Heng said: “We have also reminded every soldier to take good care of himself and herself to go see a doctor or let the commanders know when you’re feeling unwell.” CLEANING BUNKS While Recruit Zachary Ho said it’s definitely “quite a hassle” to have to clean his bunk more frequently, he acknowledged the rationale behind it given the virus outbreak. “As much as we hate it, we’ll do our best to try to reach every nook and cranny of the bunk to make sure it’s free of dust and bacteria,” the 18-year-old said. “We use the anti-bacterial wet wipes or bleach given to us to clean down the room as best as we can.”   Recruit Muhammad Syukri Sallehuddin, 18, said his parents were initially concerned for his well-being after the DORSCON level was raised and asked if the flu had been going around. “After knowing the measures, they were less worried,” he added. “The commanders really try to open up and ask us to let them know if we were feeling unwell.” The platoon commanders in charge of the recruits said they make it a point to enforce the increased frequency of cleaning to ensure the bunks are hygienic. Beyond that, Second Lieutenant John Pravin Kanesan, 22, said it was about being more open with recruits and telling them it’s fine to inform of symptoms and report sick. “After DORSCON Orange, what we have started thinking about more is to ensure that there’s an open culture of reporting whenever recruits are feeling sick,” he added.

13 Feb 2020 05:55AM,US health authority shipped faulty coronavirus test kits across country: Official,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners WASHINGTON: A number of test kits sent out by United States health authorities to labs across the country to diagnose the deadly novel coronavirus are faulty, a senior official said on Wednesday (Feb 12). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began shipping 200 test kits nationwide on Feb 5 to speed up the diagnosis of US cases of COVID-19, which currently number at 13. But the labs reported that while performing a verification procedure they realised the kits were returning inconclusive results, meaning neither positive nor negative, said senior CDC official Nancy Messonnier. ""We think that the issue at the stage, can be explained by one reagent that isn't performing as it should, consistently,"" she said, referring to one of the substances used in the kit. ""And that's why we are remanufacturing that reagent."" It was not clear how many kits were flawed. Of six US state health departments that responded to Reuters' requests for comment, half of them, including California and Georgia, said they were waiting for a replacement component for kits to make them work. Other states, such as Illinois, said kits had produced accurate results and they were now doing their own testing. The test issues came up as scientists from the United States and other countries tried to get access to data to validate reports suggesting the number of new cases of the virus in China has been dropping. Since late January, the CDC has rushed to distribute the kits to allow states to do their own, faster testing rather than ship all samples to CDC headquarters in Atlanta. Accelerating the speed of tests, which can be delayed by days if sent to Atlanta, is important given the agency's expectation the virus at some point is likely to start spreading within US communities. Messonnier cautioned that at some point the US was likely to see community spread of the virus. She told reporters that authorities ""should be prepared for this new virus to take a foothold in the US"".

CASE 38 Case 38 is a 52-year-old Singaporean woman who had visited The Life Church and Missions Singapore, which has been linked to another cluster of cases. She reported onset of symptoms on Feb 3 and visited Choa Chu Kang Polyclinic the day after. She was admitted to NCID on Feb 7, where tests confirmed the infection. Prior to hospital admission, she had also visited Marina Bay Sands, Chinatown and Plaza Singapura and had travelled by public transport. She lives at Choa Chu Kang Avenue 3. CASE 39 Case 39 is a 51-year-old Singaporean man who attended the same business meeting as several other cases at Grand Hyatt, and lives at Jurong West Central. He travelled to Malaysia from Jan 23 to Feb 2. On Jan 29, he reported the onset of symptoms and visited two GP clinics on Feb 3 and 5. He was admitted to NCID on Feb 6 and tested positive for the infection on Feb 8. CASE 40 Case 40 is a 36-year-old Singaporean man who works at Yong Thai Hang and lives at Bedok North Street. He reported the onset of symptoms on Jan 30 and visited a GP clinic the same day. He was identified as a close contact of two other cases linked to the health products shop, and placed under home quarantine on Feb 4. He was admitted to NCID on Feb 7 and tested positive the following day. LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing, with the help of the police, have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases, MOH said. Nine of Singapore's cases are linked to the cluster associated with Yong Thai Hang at 24 Cavan Road in Jalan Besar. Five cases are linked to The Life Church and Missions Singapore at 146B Paya Lebar Road. Three cases are linked to the Grand Hyatt business meeting in Singapore. Investigations on these clusters are ongoing, and contact tracing is under way for the locally transmitted cases, said the ministry. SUSPECTED CASES As of Feb 8 noon, 438 of the suspected cases have tested negative for the novel coronavirus. Test results for the remaining 181 cases are pending. A total of 758 close contacts of the confirmed cases have been identified. Of the 663 who are still in Singapore, 647 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining 16 close contacts, said MOH. Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing, said the health ministry. MOH said it will continue to monitor the situation. ""As medical practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases who have recently been in China, Singapore is likely to see more cases that will need to be investigated,"" it said.  DORSCON ORANGE On Friday, Singapore raised the DORSCON level to Orange following several cases of novel coronavirus without any links to previous cases or travel history to mainland China. This means the disease is deemed severe and spreads easily from person to person, but has not spread widely and is being contained. Moderate disruption is expected, due to measures such as quarantine and visitor restrictions at hospitals. A second flight bringing Singaporeans and their family members back from Wuhan, Hubei is expected to arrive in Singapore on Sunday morning. At least 722 people have died from the virus in China while more than 34,000 have been infected, according to the latest official figures.

11 Feb 2020 06:20PM,New coronavirus found in Japan evacuees who initially tested negative,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TOKYO: Two Japanese citizens evacuated from the epicentre of a novel coronavirus outbreak have been diagnosed with the infection after initially testing negative, the health ministry said on Tuesday (Feb 11). One of the two, a man in his 50s who returned from the Chinese city of Wuhan on the first Japanese evacuation flight on Jan 29, previously twice tested negative for the virus. However, a third test 12 days later found the man - who has been isolated in his hotel room since his return - was infected. Japan Health Ministry announces at 5 pm local time 2 more cases of #coronavirus of Japanese who returned from #Wuhan on government chartered flights number 1 and 2. 1 was quarantined at a hotel in Chiba before hospitalization. Another stayed home in contact with 2 family members. https://t.co/8CN0nTt3bE  According to the World Health Organization, the coronavirus incubation period ""could be up to 14 days"". The second evacuee, a Japanese man in his 40s, returned from Wuhan on Jan 30 and initially tested negative for the virus, but was diagnosed after a second test on Monday. The new cases bring the number of infections inside Japan to 28, excluding dozens diagnosed aboard a cruise ship moored off the coast. So far, 135 people on board the Diamond Princess have tested positive for the virus since it arrived off Japan last Monday. Authorities on Tuesday were removing from the ship the most recently diagnosed 65 crew and passengers.   The ship was carrying 3,711 people when it arrived off Japan on the evening of Feb 3, and was officially placed into quarantine two days later. Only those diagnosed with the virus or suffering other serious health conditions have been allowed off the boat, which is expected to remain in quarantine until at least Feb 19. People on board the ship on Tuesday tweeted that medicines were being delivered to passengers, and that the ship's captain had announced the vessel would head out to sea overnight to produce fresh water and other operations. Japan has evacuated hundreds of its citizens from Wuhan since the outbreak began. They have been asked to self-quarantine, with most staying in government-appointed hotels for a period of 14 days. Evacuees from the first flight, which landed Jan 29, are expected to be released from self-quarantine this week after undergoing an additional test for the virus, officials said. Japan is planning to send a fifth evacuation flight to Wuhan later this week.

01 Feb 2020 01:11PM,Chinese tourists desert Thai resort as Wuhan coronavirus spreads,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners PHUKET, Thailand: The narrow laneways and pastel-coloured shophouses of Phuket Old Town are usually bustling with Chinese tourists during the Lunar New Year holiday, but travel bans and local fears about coronavirus have largely emptied the streets this year. Just a handful of tourists, many wearing face masks, strolled through the area during daylight hours this week. In the evening, foot traffic increased a little under the glow of the red lanterns strung across the thoroughfare, but remained far below normal levels. ""The impact is tremendous,"" 45-year old Ausana Akaradachakul told Reuters as she waited behind the counter for shoppers in her store selling postcards, straw bags, clothing and jewellery. ""Only a few days after the news broke about the virus, the Chinese tourists were visibly few,"" Akaradachakul said. ""I think about 70per cent of them are gone.""   The beach resort of Phuket is Thailand's second most visited destination after Bangkok and is usually a big draw for visitors from China, who accounted for 11 million visitors last year, particularly around the Lunar New Year holiday. But China this week imposed restrictions on all overseas tour groups because of the coronavirus that originated in the city of Wuhan and which has infected more than 11,000 people and killed more than 250. Reduced travel from China alone could result in 50 billion baht (US$1.52 billion) of lost tourism revenue, the Thai Tourism Ministry estimated. The spread of coronavirus beyond China has also affected domestic tourism in Thailand, which has recorded more infections than anywhere but China with 19 cases. Thailand announced its first case of human-to-human transmission on Friday (Jan 31).   Shopkeepers in Phuket said that had left Thai tourists wary of venturing out to join what should have been an annual festival on Walking Street at the heart of the town. ""There are barely any tourists around here. The people we are seeing now are just the locals,"" clothes store vendor Parichart Chaengmanee told Reuters as she sat on a stool outside her empty clothing stall, wearing a black face mask. ""Even the number of Thai tourists is low."" Shopkeepers are hoping the impact is shortlived, with one sign in a store window reading: ""The Thai people pray for China and hope China will recover soon. China and Thailand are family!""

01 Feb 2020 07:31AM,'I saw Singapore's first SARS case; I’m still alive and standing': At the frontline of the Wuhan coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: When she met with Singapore’s first severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patient 17 years ago, Dr Brenda Ang was not wearing any protective equipment. “It (SARS) was unknown, she just came in like any ordinary person,” said the senior consultant with the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). The country was ill-prepared for the outbreak at the time, she said, noting there were not enough isolation rooms and efforts then were based out of the old Communicable Disease Centre compound on Moulmein Road – which has since been replaced by the NCID. The new facility is better placed to handle the Wuhan coronavirus situation, she noted. The NCID, which officially opened in September last year, has more than 330 isolation rooms at its Jalan Tan Tock Seng location. Between November 2002 and July 2003, SARS affected 8,098 people worldwide, resulting in 774 deaths across 17 countries. In Singapore, 238 were infected, resulting in the deaths of 33 people here. For her work in tackling the SARS crisis, Dr Ang received the National Day Award (Medal of Valour) and the Courage Medal. Dr Ang - who also chairs Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s infection control committee – also played a role in controlling the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. Eighteen people died in that outbreak here. THE CURRENT SITUATION The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak a ""global emergency"". As of Saturday morning, there were more than 11,000 confirmed cases of Wuhan coronavirus worldwide, with 258 reported deaths, all in China. Singapore now has 16 confirmed cases of the virus, including a 47-year-old Singaporean who travelled to Wuhan with her family. In dealing with the virus, Singapore has learned many lessons from dealing with SARS 17 years ago, she said. “Each outbreak is different, but the core principles remain the same.” These include “very strict compliance with infection control measures”, as well as ensuring accurate information gets disseminated to stem rumours and misinformation.  “Part of the reaction to any outbreak response is managing fears on the ground, as well as coming up with relevant recommendations,” she noted. For example, while frontline staff at NCID such as doctors and nurses - as well as others such as security staff who may also have to deal with patients - may need to wear masks, this is not necessary for everyone. “If you’re in finance, you don’t need to wear a mask,” she said. While morale is generally high, she acknowledges that there are concerns among staff who are dealing with the current coronavirus situation. “There are fears, especially for those who didn't go through SARS,” said Dr Ang. “We have a few SARS veterans here. One of the things I said at the first briefings (for the Wuhan coronavirus) was don’t worry, we have been through this before. We can handle it.” “I saw Singapore's first SARS case, I’m still alive and standing,” she said. The work of handling patients cannot be just be left to junior staff, she said, adding senior staff including consultants must also be seen to be doing their part. Senior anesthetists were among the first to volunteer to be on call during the SARS crisis in 2003, she noted. “Seniors cannot just be hiding in their offices, they have to be there.” On how widespread the Wuhan coronavirus is likely to be, Dr Ang said current literature suggests that even people who are exposed to the virus do not necessarily get infected. “It probably isn’t that infectious, (even though) people are wearing surgical masks all over the place.”  Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

08 Feb 2020 01:41PM,"Novel coronavirus claims first foreign victims as US citizen, Japanese man die in Wuhan","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: A US citizen who was diagnosed with the novel coronavirus and a Japanese man suspected to have the infection have both died in Wuhan. ""We can confirm that a 60-year-old US citizen diagnosed with coronavirus died at a hospital in Wuhan, China, on Feb 6,"" an embassy spokesman told AFP on Saturday (Feb 8), without specifying the person's gender. ""We offer the sincerest condolences to the family for their loss,"" the spokesman said, adding that no further comment would be made out of respect for the family's privacy. The Japanese foreign ministry in a statement on Saturday also said that one of its citizens with a suspected coronavirus infection has died in a hospital in the Chinese city. The man in his 60s had been hospitalised due to severe pneumonia and the hospital reported his death to the Japanese embassy in China, the ministry said in a statement. Chinese medical authorities said the man was highly likely to have been infected with the new coronavirus but ""it is difficult to make a definitive judgment"", the statement said. His cause of death was given as viral pneumonia, it added. These latest cases would be the first confirmed foreign deaths in China from the outbreak. Two people have died from the virus outside the mainland: A man from Wuhan in the Philippines and a 39-year-old man in Hong Kong. At least 722 people have died from the virus in China while more than 34,000 have been infected, according to the latest official figures. The Chinese foreign ministry said on Thursday that 19 foreigners have been infected in China, and two of them have recovered. The ministry refused to disclose their nationalities.

10 Feb 2020 05:22PM,"Taxi, private-hire drivers to get 300,000 masks for passengers amid coronavirus fears","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Taxi and private-hire drivers in Singapore are set to be issued with 300,000 masks that they can offer to passengers who are unwell, said the Land Transport Authority (LTA), as the country ramps up its defence against the global coronavirus outbreak. From Tuesday (Feb 11), 300,000 surgical masks will be distributed to the drivers via their taxi and ride-hailing companies in packs of four, said LTA in a press release. These masks are intended for drivers to offer to passengers who are unwell, but do not have a mask and need a ride to seek medical attention. ""Passengers should also play their part. In particular, passengers who are unwell are reminded to be socially responsible and don a mask, before their taxi or private-hire car ride,"" said LTA. As part of precautionary measures, drivers have also been asked to take their temperature twice a day. From Tuesday, eight temperature screening stations will be set up at the premises of the seven taxi companies here.  Taxi drivers whose temperatures fall within the acceptable range will receive a sticker for the day, to indicate that they are well. Private-hire drivers will be required to take their own temperatures and submit their readings via the app. The LTA, together with the National Taxi Association (NTA) and the National Private Hire Vehicle Association (NPHVA), will progressively increase the number of temperature screening stations in Singapore for all drivers, said LTA. These measures come after a taxi driver and a private-hire car driver were among seven new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus announced on Saturday. Neither had any known links to other cases. The LTA said then that it was working with operators to ramp up cleaning and hygiene measures. It also advised drivers to wind down their windows after trips to ventilate their vehicles, as well as clean and disinfect their cars more regularly. Earlier this month, a care package was announced for both taxi and private-hire drivers who are quarantined due to the virus.   These drivers are eligible for a S$100 per day allowance from the Government during the time they are quarantined. All taxi operators, as well as private-hire firms Gojek, Grab and Ryde, have said they will waive vehicle rental fees for quarantined drivers. All taxi operators, as well as Gojek, Grab, Ryde and Tada, have also committed to a one-off allowance of at least S$100 for quarantined drivers. Meanwhile, drivers who are members of either the NTA or the NPHVA are also eligible for a one-off allowance of S$200. MEASURES AIMED AT RESTORING CONFIDENCE IN TAXIS, PRIVATE-HIRE CARS On Monday, Senior Minister of State for Transport Janil Puthucheary met with about 60 taxi and private-hire drivers at the Devan Nair Institute for Employment and Employability, to discuss their concerns following the news of the two infected drivers. Speaking to the media after the session, Dr Janil said drivers he spoke to were concerned about how to sustain their livelihoods in light of the current crisis. The measures announced today are aimed at restoring confidence in the industry, he noted. “Passengers need to find a way to be confident in the vehicle and driver that’s picking them up,” he said. Noting reports of commuters finding it hard to get rides at locations such as hospitals, Dr Janil said it was understandable that drivers might feel anxious about picking up passengers who are unwell. However, drivers should have no qualms ferrying passengers who are sick but wearing masks, he said. “If there are nurses and healthcare workers that need to get home after a late night shift, I’ve asked (the drivers) to help us get these frontline workers home and have some rest,” he said. Dr Janil also debunked reports that suggested the novel coronavirus was airborne, noting the Chinese government itself had said the virus was not airborne. “All the evidence currently points to this virus being spread by droplets, not airborne, and that is what is determining the way we address it.” He acknowledged that the measures announced could be abused, for example by drivers who claim the masks for themselves instead of giving them out to sick passengers. “I think we have to accept in good faith that (drivers) will look after themselves and the people around them.” While there are other broad-based financial measures in the works to protect the livelihoods of drivers, Dr Janil said it was premature to announce anything at this stage. DRIVERS CONCERNED ABOUT GETTING INFECTED Mr Harry Ng, 61, said his daily earnings had dropped about 20 per cent in the two weeks since the first coronavirus cases were announced here. However, the impact was much worse during the SARS crisis in 2003, when passengers were few and far between, said the cabbie of 25 years. Drivers are concerned about getting infected, as well as passing the infection down to their families, said NTA president Raymond Ong. “The fear is there,” said the 60-year-old, who has been a taxi driver for 20 years. Drivers are also hopeful that the Government can work together with taxi operators and the NTA to ease their financial burden during this period, for example by lowering the cost of renting their vehicles, said Mr Ong. The drop in passenger numbers means some drivers struggle to cover costs such as rental and fuel, he noted. In a statement, Mr Ang Hin Kee - who is advisor to both the NTA and the NPHVA - said the two associations were continuing to explore ways to assist drivers who are infected and quarantined with their expenses. “We are also doing more to ensure that drivers at large are taken care of during this period so that they can continue to deliver safe and quality services to commuters,” he said.

09 Feb 2020 02:19PM,Singapore Airshow organiser to limit public day tickets amid coronavirus concerns,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The organiser of the Singapore Airshow plans to sell fewer tickets to the public as part of measures against the novel coronavirus, as it confirmed more than 70 participating companies have pulled out. Experia Events managing director Leck Chet Lam said he expects ticket sales to be “significantly less than half” compared to the previous edition of the airshow in 2018, which attracted nearly 80,000 public visitors over two days. “We are looking at how we can have a smaller public day attendance,” he told reporters on Sunday (Feb 9), adding that there is also an idea to sell less tickets ""so that the attendance will be controlled.” He did not say how many public day tickets have currently been sold or what the allocation is. When asked what will happen to existing ticket holders if the limit is exceeded, Mr Leck said the organiser will “work it out” with them. “That’s also part of looking at the situation and making sure we take care of the well-being of people who are attending the show,” he added. Mr Leck also revealed that more than 70 participating companies have pulled out of attending the airshow, although he said this represents less than eight per cent of the initial turnout. Nineteen exhibitors have confirmed they are not attending, including US defence contractor Lockheed Martin. This means there will be 10 to 15 fewer static aircraft displays than the 45 in 2018, Mr Leck said. This comes after Singapore on Friday raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange, as authorities announced three new cases of the virus, bringing the total to 40. Under the new DORSCON level, organisers of large events should take necessary precautions such as carrying out temperature screening, looking out for respiratory symptoms like cough or runny nose, and denying entry to unwell individuals. The Ministry of Health had also urged organisers to cancel or defer non-essential large-scale events. AIRSHOW WILL GO ON When asked if the airshow will be cancelled if the DORSCON level was raised to the maximum Red, Mr Leck said the organiser will refer to guidelines by the relevant authorities. As for now, Mr Leck said the airshow – which he described as an “important node” in the global aviation industry – will go on. “Our responsibility is to still carry on with the show so exhibitors and trade visitors continue to have a platform to meet and talk about business opportunities,” he said. “Those who have pulled out, we respect their decision. Those who chose to come, we also respect it, and how we respect that is we put all the necessary preventive measures on site to make sure their well-being is taken care of.”   As part of measures against the outbreak, the organiser has implemented seat tagging for all seated events to facilitate contact tracing, and temperature screening at Singapore Expo and Changi Exhibition Centre access points. The organiser also encourages alternative greetings among attendees like waving or bowing, instead of the conventional handshake. This is in addition to measures like more frequent cleaning, having doctors and medics on site, and making hand sanitisers available. Mr Leck said the public will have to “make their own decisions” on whether they should buy a ticket. “But if they choose to come to the show, we have put all the precautionary measures in place,” he added.

01 Feb 2020 08:50AM,"As coronavirus misinformation spreads on social media, Facebook removes posts","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Facebook Inc said it will take down misinformation about China's fast-spreading coronavirus, in a rare departure from its usual approach to dubious health content that is presenting a fresh challenge for social media companies. SAN FRANCISCO: Facebook Inc said it will take down misinformation about China's fast-spreading coronavirus, in a rare departure from its usual approach to dubious health content that is presenting a fresh challenge for social media companies. The coronavirus outbreak has stoked a wave of anti-China sentiment around the globe. Hoaxes have spread widely online, promoted by conspiracy theorists and exacerbated by a dearth of information from the cordoned-off zone around China's central city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began. Nearly 12,000 people have been infected in China, according to local health authorities, and more than 130 cases reported in at least 25 other countries and regions. Facebook said in a blog post that it would remove content about the virus ""with false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organizations and local health authorities,"" saying such content would violate its ban on misinformation leading to ""physical harm."" The move is unusually aggressive for the world's biggest social network, which generally limits the distribution of content containing health misinformation to its 2.9 billion monthly users through restrictions on search results and advertising, but allows the original posts to stay up. It also puts it at odds with other major U.S.-based social networks. Alphabet Inc's YouTube, which has 2 billion monthly users and Twitter and Reddit, which have hundreds of millions of users, confirmed they do not consider inaccurate information about health to be a violation of their policies. Those companies, like Facebook in other cases, rely on techniques such as elevating medical information from authoritative public health sources and warning users about content that has been debunked. TikTok, owned by China's Bytedance, and Pinterest Inc do ban health misinformation and are actively removing false coronavirus content, they told Reuters. FAKE NEWS, PHYSICAL HARM Fact-checking initiative PolitiFact said misinformation about the virus online included hoaxes about its source, its spread, and how to treat it, as well as false conspiracies about its connection to biological warfare and the Chinese government. Rumors about the coronavirus have also spread widely on Chinese social networks, which are usually quick to remove sensitive content but have in recent days allowed an unusual level of public criticism over the government's handling of the crisis. Information in China is tightly controlled, and Chinese laws dictate that rumor-mongers can face years in prison. In the early days of the outbreak, Chinese state media reported that police in Wuhan had detained eight people for spreading rumors about a ""local outbreak of unidentifiable pneumonia."" Suspicion also lingers over accusations that Beijing initially covered up the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. A spokeswoman for Tencent Holdings Inc's Chinese messaging app WeChat, which has 1.15 billion monthly users, told Reuters the company was removing posts containing coronavirus-related misinformation. The U.S. tech industry's mostly hands-off approach has angered critics who say social media companies have failed to curb the spread of medical inaccuracies that pose major global health threats. In particular, misinformation about vaccination has proliferated on social media in many countries in recent years, including during major vaccination campaigns to prevent polio in Pakistan and to immunize against yellow fever in South America. Facebook, under fierce scrutiny worldwide in recent years over its privacy and content practices, has previously removed vaccine misinformation in Samoa, where a measles outbreak killed dozens late last year. The spread of illness there was so severe that the company classified anti-vaccination content a risk of physical harm, a spokeswoman told Reuters, calling the move an ""extreme action."" The coronavirus and Samoa decisions indicate Facebook is expanding its definition of ""physical harm"" to include misinformation contributing to the rapid spread of illness. The company did not say whether it had acted in a similar way in other cases. It removed misinformation about polio vaccines in Pakistan, but the imminent harm in that case involved risks of violence against the health workers carrying out the immunization campaigns, the spokeswoman said.

02 Feb 2020 06:58AM,Wuhan coronavirus: Death toll in China rises to 304 with 45 new fatalities,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The number of deaths in China's central Hubei province from the new coronavirus outbreak had risen by 45 to 304 as of the end of Saturday (Feb 1), Chinese state television reported. There had been a further 1,921 cases detected in Hubei, the epicentre of the outbreak, taking the total in the province to 9,074. Nationwide, the number of infections has passed 14,300. Most of the country's deaths and overall cases have been in Hubei, a populous province in China's centre. The top Communist Party official in Wuhan, the central city of 11 million people where the virus first emerged in December, on Friday expressed ""remorse"" because local authorities acted too slowly. The virus is believed to have emerged in December in the provincial capital of Wuhan in a meat market that sold wild game. Last week, China's central government finally jumped into action, effectively sealing off Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province, and curbing travel across the nation of 1.4 billion people. But the epidemic has spread far and wide as Chinese people travelled across the country and abroad over the Chinese New Year holiday that started last week. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a global health emergency, but said it was not recommending any international trade or travel restrictions. It has since ballooned into a global health emergency with cases in more than 20 countries. Countries have scrambled to evacuate their nationals from Wuhan, with hundreds of US, Japanese, British, French and South Korean citizens evacuated so far, and more countries planning airlifts. A flight carrying more than 300 Indian nationals left Wuhan in the early hours of Saturday for New Delhi. About 200 US evacuees who landed in California on Wednesday have been put under a rare mandatory quarantine order for 14 days. US carriers American, United and Delta joined other airlines suspending flights to China, following the State Department travel advisory. Russia said it would evacuate more than 2,500 of its citizens holidaying on China's Hainan island, far from the epicentre of the outbreak, a day after sealing its remote far-eastern border.

PM Lee highlighted the efforts of many Singaporeans stepping up during this period, including grassroots leaders and Team Nila volunteers helping to distribute masks to households, university students delivering food to schoolmates confined to their dorms on leave of absence, and healthcare workers treating patients.  PM Lee also lauded the efforts of business federations, unions, public transport workers, noting how they have gone the extra mile to maintain services, take care of workers, and keep Singapore running. ""They are inspirations to all of us. This is what it means to be Singaporean. This is who we are,"" he said. However, PM Lee said that the situation is still evolving, with each day bringing new developments, which Singapore has to respond to promptly and dynamically. ""NO NEED TO PANIC"" PM Lee noted that while most of the coronavirus cases in Singapore have either been imported, or linked to imported cases, there have been some that cannot be traced to the source of infection. ""These worried us, because it showed that the virus is probably already circulating in our own population,"" said Mr Lee.   As a result of the local transmissions, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Friday. DORSCON takes into account the current disease situation overseas, how transmissible the disease is, how likely it is to arrive in Singapore and what impact it may have on the local community. It was also raised to Orange during the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009.    ""So there is no need to panic. We are not locking down the city or confining everybody to stay at home. We have ample supplies, so there is no need to stock up with instant noodles, tinned food, or toilet paper, as some people did yesterday,"" he said. If the number of cases of infection continues to grow, however, Singapore will have to reconsider its strategy, said PM Lee, as it is ""futile to try to trace every contact"" if the virus is widespread. Hospitals would be overwhelmed if every suspect case is hospitalised and isolated, he said. At that point, provided the fatality rate is low, Singapore could shift its approach to encourage those with mild symptoms to see their family GP instead of going to the hospital. This way, he said, hospitals and healthcare workers would be able to focus on the most vulnerable patients instead.   However, Singapore is not at that point yet, said PM Lee. ""It may or may not happen, but we are thinking ahead and anticipating the next few steps,"" he said. ""And I am sharing these possibilities with you, so that we are all mentally prepared for what may come."" ""WE CAN EACH DO OUR PART"" Whatever the situation, we can each do our part, said PM Lee. People should observe personal hygiene, take their temperature twice daily, and if they are unwell, avoid crowded places and see a doctor immediately. ""These simple steps do not take much effort, but if we all do them, they will go a long way towards containing the spread of the virus,"" he said. PM Lee said that he is confident of the medical outcome of the outbreak, and that most Singaporeans should remain well. Those who fall ill should expect to recover, said PM Lee - among those who have been hospitalised so far, despite a few remaining in critical condition, most are stable or improving, with some having already been discharged after recovering.   ""Fear and anxiety are natural human reactions. We all want to protect ourselves and our families from what is still a new and unknown disease. But fear can do more harm than the virus itself,"" he said. ""It can make us panic, or do things which make matters worse, like circulating rumours online, hoarding facemasks or food, or blaming particular groups for the outbreak. ""We should take courage and see through this stressful time together."" PM Lee concluded by urging Singaporeans to stay united and resolute during the outbreak. ""Take sensible precautions, help one another, stay calm, and carry on with our lives,"" he said.

07 Feb 2020 06:41AM,"China coronavirus death toll hits 636, more than 30,000 infections","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The official Chinese death toll from the coronavirus outbreak rose on Friday (Feb 7) to 636, with the government saying total infections had climbed past 30,000. The toll was raised by 73 new deaths from the epidemic, the National Health Commission said in its daily update. Another 3,143 new cases of infection were confirmed, bringing total infections in the country thus far to 31,161, it said. The central province of Hubei where the virus originated continued to be hardest-hit, accounting for 69 of the new deaths reported in the 24 hours to Friday. Of the reported infections, more than 4,800 of those people were in serious condition. Chinese authorities are still struggling to contain the outbreak despite ordering millions of people indoors in a growing number of cities, with overwhelmed hospitals struggling to treat the surging numbers of ill. The contagion emerged in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan in December, later spreading to the rest of China and more than two dozen other countries, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a global emergency. The number of confirmed infections in China could still grow significantly, with the health commission saying that more than 26,000 other people were ""suspected"" of having contracted the virus.

11 Feb 2020 01:09PM,Two coronavirus patients discharged from Malaysian hospitals remain in the country for now: Chinese embassy,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners KUALA LUMPUR: Two of the three novel coronavirus patients who have been discharged from Malaysian hospitals are currently still in the country, said the Chinese Embassy in Kuala Lumpur. “One of them is in Johor Bahru, while another in Kuala Lumpur,” a spokesperson told CNA in a written reply on Monday (Feb 10). Another patient, a four-year-old girl from Guangdong, left Malaysia with her family on Sunday morning, following her full recovery at Langkawi’s Sultanah Maliha Hospital, Malaysian media reported.   The coronavirus outbreak has gripped China and other countries, with more than 43,000 infections and over 1,000 deaths worldwide so far. Wuhan in Hubei province, the outbreak epicentre, is under lockdown while flights into the city have been temporarily cancelled. Malaysia, which has extended its travel ban on Chinese nationals to all provinces placed under lockdown by the Chinese government, has seen 18 confirmed cases, of whom 12 are Chinese nationals. After receiving treatment in isolation wards at medical facilities, three of the patients tested negative for the virus and were allowed to return home. The four-year-old girl aside, the other two recovered patients are a 40-year-old man discharged from Johor’s Permai Hospital on Feb 8 and a 63-year-old man discharged from Kuala Lumpur Hospital on Feb 9. Both men originated from Wuhan. When asked if there was any particular reason for the duo to remain in Malaysia, the embassy replied: “They have not requested to return to Wuhan, and we’re not privy to the reason behind their decision.” The spokesperson said that most of the patients treated in Malaysia are making good recovery. “Under the meticulous treatment of Malaysian Health Ministry, (we believe) more patients will be discharged in the near future,” the spokesperson added.   The embassy stands ready to provide assistance to Chinese nationals who contracted the virus in Malaysia, the spokesperson said. Among other things, it is helping them and their family members to extend their travel visas, with assistance from Malaysia's Immigration Department. “For those recovered, we also sort out food and accommodation, and assist them to make flight arrangements home,” the spokesperson said.

09 Feb 2020 11:36AM,"FairPrice imposes purchase limits for paper products, rice and instant noodles amid coronavirus outbreak","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Shoppers at all NTUC FairPrice outlets will only be allowed to buy four packs of paper products, two bags of rice and four bundle packs of instant noodles per customer from Sunday (Feb 9). In a notice put up in stores across Singapore on Sunday morning, FairPrice said the purchase limits were put in place “to ensure more customers have access to high-demand items”. The S$50 limit for vegetables also remained in place. The move came after supermarkets saw a surge in demand for groceries and personal hygiene items, after the Government raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange due to the global coronavirus outbreak. On Sunday, the Ministry of Health confirmed three new cases of the novel coronavirus, taking the total number of cases in Singapore to 43. The virus has killed more than 800 people and infected more than 37,000 globally. The additional purchase limits are part of efforts to discourage customers from stockpiling, said a FairPrice spokesperson in response to CNA's queries. ""The limits are set just slightly higher than what an average grocery shopper normally buys to give customers greater purchase flexibility. Bulk purchase of vegetables is disallowed to discourage resellers,"" said the spokesperson, urging shoppers to buy only what they need. In the notice, FairPrice also reassured customers that a supply of daily essentials remains available despite the sudden surge in demand and noted that deliveries to stores have been increased. FairPrice Group CEO Seah Kian Peng had said on Saturday that there were more than 9 million toilet rolls, about 1.2 million packs of instant noodles and more than 4 million kg of rice in its distribution centres. Supermarket chains Sheng Siong, Prime Supermarket and Dairy Farm Group, which runs the Giant and Cold Storage supermarkets, said they have not implemented purchase limits as there is sufficient stock to meet customers' needs. “We will not limit customers’ purchase and we trust the public to be rational and not stockpile as food items will expire,” said a Sheng Siong spokesperson. ""BUY WHAT YOU NEED"" FairPrice has increased the volume of its daily essentials being sent to its stores by three times, he had said. The number of delivery trips has also doubled. “This sudden surge was one that, I would say, caught us by surprise. But I want to assure everyone out there, as you have seen at one of our three warehouses here, we do have stock available. But it does take us time to replenish the stocks, of which we are trying our best,” said Mr Seah. He urged shoppers to only ""buy what you need"", saying that there's no need for them to ""create your own little stockpile at home"". ""Because when you do that and everyone’s trying to get it on the same day and at the same time buying more things, you just add strain to the system.” On Sunday evening, Mr Seah reiterated in a Facebook post that the purchase limits were imposed ""NOT because we do not have enough stocks"". The limits were instead put in place to ""allow our supply chain to CATCH UP on its deliveries to all our stores"" and ""ensure no one can buy up huge quantities and hoard and deprive others as a result"", he said. Even as FairPrice ""doubled"" its delivery runs over the last two days, it was still not enough as the volume of products handled was ""more than the peak days of CNY"", he added.  ""My supply chain and whole team are working non-stop to try to catch up on deliveries to all our stores,"" said Mr Seah, adding that they ""are making good progress"". ""Let us stay calm and work through this period together as a community. It is beginning to look more like a normal Sunday."" Additional reporting by Deborah Wong.

06 Feb 2020 10:04PM,Condition worsens for 2 coronavirus patients in Singapore: MOH,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The condition of two coronavirus patients in Singapore has worsened, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Thursday (Feb 6). ""One is now in critical condition in the intensive care unit, and another requires additional oxygen support,"" it said in a press release. Two new cases were also confirmed by the ministry on Thursday, bringing the total number of cases in Singapore to 30. Both new cases are in a stable condition, MOH said. Among the earlier 28 confirmed cases, one has been discharged. Most of the other patients are ""stable or improving,"" MOH said. As of noon on Thursday, 310 of the suspect cases have tested negative for the coronavirus. Test results for the remaining 147 cases are pending, the ministry added. ONE PATIENT DISCHARGED SO FAR The first patient to be discharged was a 35-year-old man from Wuhan who was Singapore’s seventh confirmed case. He had been “comprehensively tested negative” for the coronavirus, the ministry said on Feb 4. His symptoms had “fully resolved” and consecutive tests over three days all came back negative, MOH’s director of medical services Kenneth Mak had told a press conference. The man had tested positive for the coronavirus on Jan 27. He arrived in Singapore four days before and went to Raffles Hospital after he developed symptoms on Jan 24. He was then transferred to NCID. Singapore on Saturday widened travel restrictions to stop all new visitors of any nationality with recent travel history to mainland China from entering Singapore. These visitors are also not allowed to transit in Singapore. The virus, believed to have originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has killed more than 560 people and infected more than 28,000, the vast majority of them in China. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the virus outbreak a global emergency.

08 Feb 2020 06:00AM,"Commentary: Amid gloomy outlook, Hong Kong wrestles with novel coronavirus. But it’s surprisingly resilient","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners The Hong Kong economy has weathered two recent economic crisis over recent decades. But the novel coronavirus and continuing protests pose a different challenge, says Mohammed Abdul Shihab. DUBAI: As protests in Hong Kong continue into the New Year, the city is grappling with a new challenge: A slowing Asian economy made worse by the novel coronavirus outbreak. The coronavirus shows no signs of slowing, having infected more than 30,000 people and claiming hundreds of lives in mainland China. Hong Kong has reported more than 20 cases and at least one death. At least four of the reported cases were transmitted locally, leading some to say that the city is on the brink of a community outbreak comparable to SARS. Meanwhile, the World Bank says the continent will have to contend with weakening global demand – a challenge exacerbated by the largely unresolved trade war between Washington and Beijing despite a Phase 1 deal. Growth in East Asia is projected to ease to 5.7 per cent in 2020, reflecting also a moderate slowdown in China and external headwinds. But these projections may be downgraded again in light of the worsening effects of the novel coronavirus on the Chinese, and thus the Asian, economy. Markets were stable early last week on the back of estimates that this new virus would have little economic impact given the 2003 SARS outbreak did little damage. Last Thursday, however, global markets dove after news of an uptick in new infections, and, that the lockdown imposed in China has effectively shut down vast swathes of its working population. The selloff continued in China on Monday as stocks there dropped 8 per cent. THE LIGHTHOUSE IN STORMY WATERS During past slowdowns, Hong Kong was seen as the lighthouse in stormy waters – an economic powerhouse and political haven that could withstand both regional and global pressures. Carefully cultivated fiscal policies have made the city an indispensable base for multinational banks and corporations. Hong Kong has also maintained the top spot on the 2019 Index of Economic Freedom, which noted that the territory is “an exceptionally competitive financial and business hub that remains one of the world’s most resilient economies"".   Heading into the new decade, however, the reality is more nuanced. Continuing protests have shaken confidence in the city’s financial hub, stymied tourism, and hurt its retail sector. Compounded with reverberations from the trade war, Hong Kong’s economy contracted 2.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2019, marking the third consecutive contraction in the city state’s first recession in a decade. This downturn is conservatively forecast to end in the latter half of 2020, with the International Monetary Fund predicting overall GDP growth of about 1.5 per cent for the year. Interestingly, these predictions already take into account disruptions arising from the months-long protests, meaning an easing of these disturbances could ease economic stress in 2020. That, in addition to the tough lessons learned from financial crises in the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 2008 global crisis, could make Hong Kong one of the region’s best economic performers this year. HONG KONG HAS SURVIVED PAST CRISES In 1997, Asia was hit by an economic crisis when currencies across the east of the continent – starting with Thailand – began to fall precipitously, triggering bailouts in some cases by the International Monetary Fund. As a sell-off intensified, Hong Kong took advantage of its vast foreign exchange reserves to swiftly protect the peg that linked its currency’s value to that of the US dollar. At the time, economists described this peg as “the indicator of political confidence,” and predicted a loss would have fuel capital flight, tumbling property prices and collapsing banks. Having the foresight to build such large foreign reserves and the insight to harness them led to a strong defence of the currency against a speculative attack.   Hong Kong officials also reacted swiftly to shore up targeted companies after speculators turned their eye to the stock market. In all, Hong’s Kong’s stock market remained the best performing market in the region during the crisis, despite the Hang Seng falling by 60 per cent that year and property prices slumping. Although the contributing factors to the 2008 global recession were different, catalysed by the US subprime mortgage crisis, lessons learned from the downturn 10 years earlier helped the territory stay on its feet and turned the economy around in the same year. Donald Tong, Hong Kong Commissioner for Economic and Trade Affairs, said the city defied the downturn because of improvements in risk management, a more transparent regulatory environment, a continued focus on financial innovation, and sound fundamentals including “prudent fiscal policies and healthy fiscal reserves”. Measures were enacted to boost public confidence, including a government guarantee on all bank deposits without a ceiling, a prioritising of public infrastructure projects, and a multibillion-dollar plan to unfreeze credit for businesses. Singing praises for the Hong Kong Treasury’s actions, Janet Yellen, who went on to chair the US Federal Reserve, noted Hong Kong was recovering “impressively” from the global recession - more so than the United States. A NEW ERA? The city’s resilience, underpinned by an elastic and dynamic monetary policy, should instill a sense of confidence that it is well-positioned to handle global economic uncertainties in 2020. Yet this time around, Hong Kong will fight a slightly different battle: A battle against the novel coronavirus outbreak. Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced the closure of all but two land border crossings to China, as well as a mandatory two-week quarantine for all travellers arriving from mainland China this week.   But criticism has grown over the government’s perceived slow response to the outbreak, amid calls for Hong Kong to fully close the border with the mainland. Hundreds of medical workers went on strike starting from Feb 3, demanding the government seal off the border to stop the spread of the virus and ease pressure on strained health facilities. An escalation of the outbreak, not just in Hong Kong but also in China, would add significant stress already imposed by the city’s divisive protest groups. The protests alone were responsible for visitor numbers falling by almost 40 per cent in the second half of 2019, fuelled by uncertainty in public safety. Trips from mainland China have taken a nosedive, and in October, were down more than 45 per cent compared with the same period last year. The unrest has also hurt retail. Last November, sales were lower than the year before, with small businesses feeling under strain, unemployment rising, and footfall declining because of how many recent demonstrations had taken place in shopping districts. On the other hand, Alibaba’s blockbuster secondary listing in Hong Kong in November last year, the biggest IPO in 2019, eased fears of a recession and was seen by many as a vote of confidence in the city. THE WORLD’S FREEST ECONOMY During the crisis of 1998, Joseph Yam, the then Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority affirmed: We are committed to maintaining our position as the world's freest economy. Hong Kong has built its reputation on free market principles. Indeed, for Hong Kong to stay true to form as financially resilient, protest groups and the government will need to begin tough negotiations on how to revive the city’s civility.   Already, outbreak fears risk becoming a new flashpoint in the city’s unrest. The Hong Kong government had to halt work on turning a housing estate as a possible quarantine facility after violent protests erupted on Monday (Jan 27) as protesters hurled a molotov cocktail at the site. No doubt, any new negotiations will focus on a cohesive political agreement, and one that reaffirms the “one-country, two-systems” principle that has allowed Hong Kong to embrace the West and China so successfully. But now that challenge is compounded by a deadly virus outbreak – a threat Lam’s administration must respond to decisively to avoid opening up another front for violent protests. The city’s political and economic future depend on it. Mohammed Abdul Shihab is Managing Director of Al-Sharq Advisory. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

21 Jan 2020 02:50PM,Wuhan pneumonia outbreak: Asia ramps up defence against coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BANGKOK: Asia stepped up its defences Tuesday (Jan 21) against a new SARS-like virus, introducing mandatory screenings at airports of arrivals from high-risk areas of China as authorities move to head off a billowing regional health crisis. From Bangkok to Hong Kong and Seoul, authorities have gone onto high-alert over the new coronavirus, following China's confirmation of the first case of human-to-human transmission of the deadly illness. Six people have died in China while 291 cases have been confirmed to be infected with the virus. Cases have been detected in Japan, South Korea and Thailand as the World Health Organization said it would meet to discuss declaring a global public health emergency over the outbreak.   Thai authorities have introduced mandatory thermal scans of passengers arriving from high-risk areas of China at its airports in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket and Krabi. Those passengers will be screened ""without exemption"", health minister Anutin Charnvirakul said in a statement, adding if they exhibit signs of fever they will be quarantined for 24 hours for monitoring. A quarter of all international flights from Wuhan - the epicentre of the deadly virus - arrive in Thailand. Around 1,300 passengers are expected each day from Wuhan over Chinese New Year, which starts this weekend. Thailand is desperate to avoid a damaging outbreak during peak tourist season. Two Chinese arrivals in Thailand have been found with the new strain of the virus - one of whom has since been discharged from hospital and has returned to China. In Hong Kong, the southern Chinese city where memories of a 2002-3 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that killed hundreds still haunt the city, authorities said they were on ""extreme high alert"". ""We are ... preparing for the worst. We have not lowered our guard,"" Hong Kong's number two leader, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung, told reporters. Hong Kong airport already routinely screens the temperatures of all passengers arriving at the airport, one of the world's busiest. Those arriving from Wuhan have to fill out health declarations and face fines and up to six months jail if they fail to declare symptoms. On Monday, hospital authorities said they would monitor anyone with a fever who bad been to Hubei province, where Wuhan is located. Our government agencies are closely monitoring the new coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China, & we are taking all necessary measures to prevent its spread. I ask that all citizens & travelers to #Taiwan take added care of their health & follow these steps: pic.twitter.com/ntgJc8tu1F  Taiwan meanwhile went onto its second-highest alert level for those travelling to and from Wuhan, advising visitors to avoid visiting any live poultry markets while screening has been stepped up at airports. China's vast land borders with its neighbours have also come under scrutiny. Vietnam's health ministry has ordered more border checks as ""the risks of infection are high"" given the daily cross-border flow of goods and people.

21 Jan 2020 10:48AM,Wuhan pneumonia outbreak: A timeline of how the new coronavirus spread,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: A new coronavirus, a mysterious SARS-like disease, has spread around China and to other countries since first emerging in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. A timeline of how the virus has spread: ALARM RAISED BY CHINA The World Health Organization (WHO) is alerted on Dec 31, 2019, by Chinese authorities of a string of pneumonia-like cases in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. Patients are quarantined and work begins on identifying the origin of the pneumonia. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies a seafood market suspected to be at the centre of the outbreak. The market is closed on Jan 1, 2020. SINGAPORE STARTS SCREENINGS AT AIRPORT On Jan 2, Singapore's Ministry of Health (MOH) says it is aware of the pneumonia outbreak and is monitoring the situation closely. Temperature screening will be implemented for all travellers arriving at Changi Airport from Wuhan and suspected cases will be referred to hospitals for further assessment. NEW CORONAVIRUS On Jan 9, the WHO says that the outbreak in Wuhan was caused by a previously unknown type of coronavirus, which is a broad family ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses like SARS. Fifty-nine people have been infected, of whom seven are in a serious condition, according to an official toll. FIRST DEATH Chinese health authorities say a first person has died of the virus on Jan 11. They revise downwards the number of sick people to 41.   SPREADS BEYOND CHINA On Jan 13, the virus spreads beyond China's borders for the first time, with a case emerging in Thailand, according to the WHO. The victim is a Chinese woman diagnosed with mild pneumonia who was returning from a trip to Wuhan. On Jan 15, China's health commission says no human-to-human transmission of the virus behind the Wuhan outbreak has been confirmed so far, but the possibility ""cannot be excluded"". The next day a first case of the virus is confirmed in Japan in someone who had stayed in Wuhan in early January.   US CONTROLS On Jan 17, a second person, a 69-year-old man, dies in Wuhan, according to authorities. The same day, the US CDC announces that it will begin screening passengers arriving from Wuhan at three airports: San Francisco, New York's JFK and Los Angeles. HUMAN-TO-HUMAN TRANSMISSION CONFIRMED On Jan 20, a third death and more than 100 new cases are announced in China, sparking concerns ahead of the annual Chinese New Year holiday which begins on Jan 25 and sees hundreds of millions of Chinese people travel nationwide. The virus is present in Beijing in the north, Shanghai in the east and Shenzhen in the south. More than 200 cases have been recorded. The virus is also detected in South Korea in a Chinese person who has arrived by plane from Wuhan. China's President Xi Jinping says that the virus must be ""resolutely contained"", in his first public comments on the outbreak. Human-to-human transmission is ""affirmative"", a top Chinese expert on infectious diseases Zhong Nanshan tells state broadcaster CCTV.   COUNTRIES STEP UP AIRPORT SCREENINGS Singapore's MOH says on Jan 20 that temperature screening at Changi Airport will be extended to all travellers arriving from China. Individuals with pneumonia who had travelled to Wuhan within 14 days before the onset of symptoms will be isolated in hospital. On Jan 21, Australia announces it will begin screening passengers from some flights from China. DEATH TOLL AT 6, MEDICAL WORKERS ILL Wuhan's mayor tells state television that the death toll has risen to six. According to state media, the number of infected patients has spiked to 291, a jump of more than 70 cases from the previously reported 218 patients. It also confirms 15 medical workers in Wuhan have been diagnosed with pneumonia, with an additional worker suspected of having the disease. Separately, China's eastern Zhejiang provincial health authority says a total of five cases of new coronavirus were confirmed as of noon on Jan 21.   VIRUS SPREADS BEYOND ASIA FOR THE FIRST TIME TO THE US On Jan 21, the CDC announces the US' first case of the virus. A US resident in his 30s who lives near Seattle approached authorities after reading about the SARS-like virus in news reports. The man entered the country on Jan 15 after travelling to Wuhan, two days before the US began deploying health officials at major airports to screen passengers arriving from that central Chinese city which is at the heart of the outbreak. The efforts are to be extended now to a total of five US airports. DEATH TOLL CLIMBS On Jan 22, an official from China's national health commission says the death toll as of Jan 21 is nine. There are a total of 440 confirmed cases across 13 provinces in China and more than 2,000 cases of close contact have also been detected. The commission's deputy head Li Bin tells reporters the coronavirus is transmitted via the respiratory tract and there is ""the possibility of viral mutation and further spread of the disease"".  MORE CASES OUTSIDE CHINA Two new cases are reported in Thailand on Jan 22 - a Thai woman who visited Wuhan and a male Chinese tourist. Both are being treated in medical facilities outside Bangkok. Macau confirms its first case, a 52-year-old businesswoman from Wuhan who went to hospital on Jan 21. Local authorities announce temperature checks at entry points, with visitors required to fill in a health declaration form. Casinos have also been provided with portable screening devices and all casino staff are required to wear surgical masks. North Korea announces it will ban tourists in a bid to keep the virus out of the country. Singapore announces it has set up a ministerial task force to deal with the Wuhan virus. Health Minister Gan Kim Yong says an imported case reaching its shores is ""inevitable"". DEATH TOLL NEARLY DOUBLES State television reports on the night of Jan 22 that the death toll has risen to 17, with the number of confirmed cases in Hubei rising to 444 as of 8pm local time. The next day, China confirms a further spike in the number of people who have the disease, taking the number of cases to 571. WUHAN QUARANTINED An effective quarantine in Wuhan kicks in at 2am on Jan 23, with flights and trains out of the city suspended and the city's public buses, subway and long-distance coaches also halted until further notice. The city has also warned people to avoid entering or leaving Wuhan. SINGAPORE CONFIRMS ITS FIRST CASE Singapore confirmed its first case of the Wuhan virus on the evening of Jan 24. A 66-year-old male Wuhan resident, who arrived in Singapore with his family on Jan 20, is currently in isolation at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and is in stable condition. The man went to SGH on Jan 22 and was immediately isolated. He was identified by the Ministry of Health as a suspect case at 10pm on Jan 22 and was tested positive for the new coronavirus at 6pm on Jan 23. The man stayed at Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa and indicated that he kept within the hotel vicinity.   Shangri-La Group who managed the hotel said that the hotel room at the resort that the man occupied has been ""thoroughly disinfected and sanitised"".  CHINA SEALS OFF MORE CITIES China shuts the city of Huangang on Jan 23. The city had reported at least 12 cases of the coronavirus. Indoor entertainment venues including movie theatres and internet cafes to shut, and asked citizens not to leave the city other than under special circumstances. By Jan 24, China suspended public transportation in at least 14 cities around the epicentre of a deadly virus outbreak, affecting the movement of about 41 million people ahead of Chinese New Year this weekend.   SINGAPORE BEGINS TEMPERATURE SCREENING AT LAND AND SEA CHECKPOINTS Temperature screening for travellers arriving at Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints began at noon on Jan 24. The screening is also being implemented in anticipation of increase in travel volume leading up to the Chinese New Year holidays, according to Immigration and Checkpoints Authority. Singapore's sea checkpoints temperature screening also started at noon, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore said in response to CNA's queries. SECOND DEATH OUTSIDE OF EPICENTRE China on Jan 24 confirmed a second death outside of Wuhan. The SARS-like virus outbreak has infected hundreds of people, raising the overall death toll to 26 dead. The number of confirmed cases had leapt to 830, according to the National Health Commission said on Jan 24.  TWO MORE CASES CONFIRMED IN SINGAPORE Two more people tested positive for the Wuhan virus in Singapore, bringing the total number of cases to three, the Ministry of Health announced on Jan 24. The new patients included the 37-year-old son of the first confirmed case, MOH said in a media briefing in the afternoon. The second new confirmed case was a 53-year-old woman from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore on a Scoot flight at 5.30am on Jan 21. She was flagged by the ministry on Thursday as a preliminary positive case. MOH said that the woman had reported that she was asymptomatic during the flight to Singapore. She sought medical attention at Raffles Hospital the next day and was later taken to the emergency department at Tan Tock Seng Hospital and immediately isolated.

07 Feb 2020 06:29PM,Precautionary measures stepped up at Victoria Junior College after teacher tests positive for novel coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Precautionary measures have been stepped up to help minimise the potential spread of the novel coronavirus at Victoria Junior College, after a teacher at the school was one of three newly infected patients in Singapore. The college will thoroughly disinfect the staff room, pantry and the teaching rooms the teacher was in, said Ms Liew Wei Li, director of schools at the Ministry of Education (MOE), at a media briefing on Friday (Feb 7). Co-curricular activities at the college have been suspended for two weeks with immediate effect, and instead of lectures there will be more “tutorial-size” classes, she said.  The 42-year-old Singaporean teacher first reported symptoms on Sunday and was admitted to hospital three days later, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). She had been absent from school for the past week on medical leave due to a high fever, and was last at school on Jan 31, MOE said in a press release. A few colleagues and students were in close contact with her and will be given 14 days’ leave of absence starting from the last day of contact, said Ms Liew. In a Facebook post on Friday night, Education Minister Ong Ye Kung said he spoke with the teacher on the phone, who told him that she ""felt bad"" over what has happened. ""I spoke with the teacher on the phone earlier this evening. She felt bad about what happened, but I assured her it was not her fault. What we are doing are necessary precautions to keep our schools safe. I also wished her speedy recovery,"" he said. Mr Ong also reminded the public of the enhanced measures that MOE has implemented, which include the suspension of inter-school and external activities. ""This is to reduce the mixing of students across schools and exposure to large crowds at public places,"" he said. ""We have also put in place a stringent hygiene regime, ensuring students and staff practise good personal hygiene, and also social hygiene protocols such as wiping down surfaces after use."" In the Facebook post, Mr Ong also said that parents asking for classes to be suspended was both ""drastic"" and ""unrealistic"". ""Some parents have suggested suspending schools. But this is a drastic move that will disrupt life for many families, and it is also not realistic to expect older children to stay home the whole time school is closed."" He also assured the public that MOE will continue to monitor the situation and take necessary steps ""to keep our people safe"".   Singapore on Friday announced three new cases of the novel coronavirus, taking the total number of people confirmed to have the virus in the country to 33. In addition to the teacher, the other two cases are a 53-year-old Singaporean man who had been in Malaysia on Jan 6, 11 and 17 and a 39-year-old Singaporean woman who had also been in Malaysia from Jan 22 to 29. None of the three new patients is linked to the existing cases or have been in China recently, said the health ministry. The Government also raised the risk assessment for the novel coronavirus outbreak from DORSCON Yellow to DORSCON Orange, introducing additional precautionary measures. These include the suspension of inter-school and external activities with immediate effect until the end of the March school holidays. All schools and teachers will also continue to implement previously announced enhanced measures such as classroom-based assemblies.   The novel coronavirus outbreak started in the Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei province, but has since spread to more than 20 countries. More than 600 people have died and at least 30,000 people have been infected with the disease, the vast majority of them in China.

06 Feb 2020 08:21AM,Ten more on cruise ship off Japan have new coronavirus: Local media,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TOKYO: Ten more people on a cruise ship off Japan have tested positive for the new coronavirus, local media said on Thursday (Feb 6), raising the number of infections detected on the boat to 20. Japanese authorities have tested 273 people among the approximately 3,700 passengers and crew members on the ship after a man who got off the boat last month in Hong Kong tested positive for the new strain.   The new cases were reported as the Diamond Princess, which was placed in quarantine off the Japanese port city of Yokohama on Monday night, docked to allow resupply and the removal of sick passengers. At the port, officials could be seen dressed in white full-body protective suits, complete with face masks and helmets. As the massive cruise ship docked, passengers who have been told they may have to stay aboard for 14 days even if they test negative for the virus, came out onto balconies, some waving to assembled media or taking pictures.   People on board have described confusion and boredom after being confined to cabins following the decision by Japanese authorities to quarantine the vessel. More than 20 countries have confirmed cases of the virus, which has infected more than 28,000 in mainland China and killed more than 560 people. The outbreak has prompted the World Health Organization to declare a global health emergency, several governments to impose travel restrictions, and airlines to suspend flights to and from China.   Japan has now confirmed 45 cases of the new coronavirus - including the cruise ship infections - among them citizens returning from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak. Tokyo has evacuated more than 500 Japanese citizens from Wuhan, and attracted some criticism for its relatively loose quarantine approach.   There have been several incidences of apparent person-to-person transmission in Japan, including a tour guide and bus driver who contracted the virus after coming into contact with visitors from Wuhan. Neither had visited China in recent months.

02 Feb 2020 08:29PM,"No new cases of Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore, total remains at 18: MOH","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The number of Wuhan coronavirus cases in Singapore remained at 18 with no new cases reported on Sunday (Feb 2), the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a daily update. None of the 18 previously announced cases is critically ill. All of them remain in stable condition, and most are improving, the ministry said. As of noon on Sunday, 240 suspect cases have tested negative for 2019-nCoV, while test results for another 43 cases are pending. MOH also gave more details on an 18th confirmed case which was announced on Saturday. The 18th case, a 31 year-old Chinese woman who arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 22, reported that she was asymptomatic during her flight to Singapore. She was a travelling companion of the 12th confirmed case and was identified as a close contact on Jan 30. She reported that she had not left her room at Home Suite View Hotel in Geylang until she was transferred to a government quarantine facility in the early hours of Jan 31. While at the facility, she reported that she has had a cough since the day before. She was taken by an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), where she was immediately isolated. Tests confirmed her 2019-nCoV infection on Saturday afternoon. She is currently warded at NCID. MOH has identified 251 close contacts of the 18 cases. Of the 182 who are still in Singapore, 179 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining three close contacts, the ministry said. Singapore on Friday announced that it will widen travel restrictions to include all new visitors with recent travel history to China. The expanded measures started at 11.59pm on Saturday. As of 1pm on Sunday, the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) has refused entry to 15 travellers into Singapore, due to either their travel histories to mainland China in the last 14 days, or suspension of visa facilities. They are of six nationalities - one Spanish, one British, one Malaysian, two US, five PRC and five Indian passport holders, ICA said. On Saturday, authorities began distributing packs of four surgical masks for each Singapore household. There have been long queues for masks at pharmacies and retailers across the country.  Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing on Sunday also said that the impact of the Wuhan coronavirus situation could be ""wider, deeper and longer"" than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. The Singapore Tourism Board has announced measures to help the tourism sector, including waiving licence fees for hotels, travel agents and tour guides.

08 Feb 2020 06:00AM,"Commentary: Amid gloomy outlook, Hong Kong wrestles with novel coronavirus. But it’s surprisingly resilient","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners The Hong Kong economy has weathered two recent economic crisis over recent decades. But the novel coronavirus and continuing protests pose a different challenge, says Mohammed Abdul Shihab. DUBAI: As protests in Hong Kong continue into the New Year, the city is grappling with a new challenge: A slowing Asian economy made worse by the novel coronavirus outbreak. The coronavirus shows no signs of slowing, having infected more than 30,000 people and claiming hundreds of lives in mainland China. Hong Kong has reported more than 20 cases and at least one death. At least four of the reported cases were transmitted locally, leading some to say that the city is on the brink of a community outbreak comparable to SARS. Meanwhile, the World Bank says the continent will have to contend with weakening global demand – a challenge exacerbated by the largely unresolved trade war between Washington and Beijing despite a Phase 1 deal. Growth in East Asia is projected to ease to 5.7 per cent in 2020, reflecting also a moderate slowdown in China and external headwinds. But these projections may be downgraded again in light of the worsening effects of the novel coronavirus on the Chinese, and thus the Asian, economy. Markets were stable early last week on the back of estimates that this new virus would have little economic impact given the 2003 SARS outbreak did little damage. Last Thursday, however, global markets dove after news of an uptick in new infections, and, that the lockdown imposed in China has effectively shut down vast swathes of its working population. The selloff continued in China on Monday as stocks there dropped 8 per cent. THE LIGHTHOUSE IN STORMY WATERS During past slowdowns, Hong Kong was seen as the lighthouse in stormy waters – an economic powerhouse and political haven that could withstand both regional and global pressures. Carefully cultivated fiscal policies have made the city an indispensable base for multinational banks and corporations. Hong Kong has also maintained the top spot on the 2019 Index of Economic Freedom, which noted that the territory is “an exceptionally competitive financial and business hub that remains one of the world’s most resilient economies"".   Heading into the new decade, however, the reality is more nuanced. Continuing protests have shaken confidence in the city’s financial hub, stymied tourism, and hurt its retail sector. Compounded with reverberations from the trade war, Hong Kong’s economy contracted 2.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2019, marking the third consecutive contraction in the city state’s first recession in a decade. This downturn is conservatively forecast to end in the latter half of 2020, with the International Monetary Fund predicting overall GDP growth of about 1.5 per cent for the year. Interestingly, these predictions already take into account disruptions arising from the months-long protests, meaning an easing of these disturbances could ease economic stress in 2020. That, in addition to the tough lessons learned from financial crises in the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 2008 global crisis, could make Hong Kong one of the region’s best economic performers this year. HONG KONG HAS SURVIVED PAST CRISES In 1997, Asia was hit by an economic crisis when currencies across the east of the continent – starting with Thailand – began to fall precipitously, triggering bailouts in some cases by the International Monetary Fund. As a sell-off intensified, Hong Kong took advantage of its vast foreign exchange reserves to swiftly protect the peg that linked its currency’s value to that of the US dollar. At the time, economists described this peg as “the indicator of political confidence,” and predicted a loss would have fuel capital flight, tumbling property prices and collapsing banks. Having the foresight to build such large foreign reserves and the insight to harness them led to a strong defence of the currency against a speculative attack.   Hong Kong officials also reacted swiftly to shore up targeted companies after speculators turned their eye to the stock market. In all, Hong’s Kong’s stock market remained the best performing market in the region during the crisis, despite the Hang Seng falling by 60 per cent that year and property prices slumping. Although the contributing factors to the 2008 global recession were different, catalysed by the US subprime mortgage crisis, lessons learned from the downturn 10 years earlier helped the territory stay on its feet and turned the economy around in the same year. Donald Tong, Hong Kong Commissioner for Economic and Trade Affairs, said the city defied the downturn because of improvements in risk management, a more transparent regulatory environment, a continued focus on financial innovation, and sound fundamentals including “prudent fiscal policies and healthy fiscal reserves”. Measures were enacted to boost public confidence, including a government guarantee on all bank deposits without a ceiling, a prioritising of public infrastructure projects, and a multibillion-dollar plan to unfreeze credit for businesses. Singing praises for the Hong Kong Treasury’s actions, Janet Yellen, who went on to chair the US Federal Reserve, noted Hong Kong was recovering “impressively” from the global recession - more so than the United States. A NEW ERA? The city’s resilience, underpinned by an elastic and dynamic monetary policy, should instill a sense of confidence that it is well-positioned to handle global economic uncertainties in 2020. Yet this time around, Hong Kong will fight a slightly different battle: A battle against the novel coronavirus outbreak. Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced the closure of all but two land border crossings to China, as well as a mandatory two-week quarantine for all travellers arriving from mainland China this week.   But criticism has grown over the government’s perceived slow response to the outbreak, amid calls for Hong Kong to fully close the border with the mainland. Hundreds of medical workers went on strike starting from Feb 3, demanding the government seal off the border to stop the spread of the virus and ease pressure on strained health facilities. An escalation of the outbreak, not just in Hong Kong but also in China, would add significant stress already imposed by the city’s divisive protest groups. The protests alone were responsible for visitor numbers falling by almost 40 per cent in the second half of 2019, fuelled by uncertainty in public safety. Trips from mainland China have taken a nosedive, and in October, were down more than 45 per cent compared with the same period last year. The unrest has also hurt retail. Last November, sales were lower than the year before, with small businesses feeling under strain, unemployment rising, and footfall declining because of how many recent demonstrations had taken place in shopping districts. On the other hand, Alibaba’s blockbuster secondary listing in Hong Kong in November last year, the biggest IPO in 2019, eased fears of a recession and was seen by many as a vote of confidence in the city. THE WORLD’S FREEST ECONOMY During the crisis of 1998, Joseph Yam, the then Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority affirmed: We are committed to maintaining our position as the world's freest economy. Hong Kong has built its reputation on free market principles. Indeed, for Hong Kong to stay true to form as financially resilient, protest groups and the government will need to begin tough negotiations on how to revive the city’s civility.   Already, outbreak fears risk becoming a new flashpoint in the city’s unrest. The Hong Kong government had to halt work on turning a housing estate as a possible quarantine facility after violent protests erupted on Monday (Jan 27) as protesters hurled a molotov cocktail at the site. No doubt, any new negotiations will focus on a cohesive political agreement, and one that reaffirms the “one-country, two-systems” principle that has allowed Hong Kong to embrace the West and China so successfully. But now that challenge is compounded by a deadly virus outbreak – a threat Lam’s administration must respond to decisively to avoid opening up another front for violent protests. The city’s political and economic future depend on it. Mohammed Abdul Shihab is Managing Director of Al-Sharq Advisory. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

10 Feb 2020 10:56AM,China stutters back to work as coronavirus deaths soar,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: Millions of people in China were returning to work on Monday (Feb 10) after an extended holiday designed to slow the spread of the new coronavirus, which has killed more than 900 people in the country. At least 40,000 people in China have now been infected by the virus, believed to have emerged late last year in Hubei province's capital Wuhan. And although the World Health Organization (WHO) has said there are tentative signs the epidemic is stabilising in China, the agency's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned that the number of cases recorded overseas could be just ""the tip of the iceberg"". His comments came as an advance team of WHO international experts left late Sunday for China, led by Bruce Aylward, a veteran of previous health emergencies. In an attempt to contain the virus, cities in Hubei have been locked down and transport routes across the country cut to stop the movement of hundreds of millions of people who usually visit family during the annual Lunar New Year holiday. The unprecedented measures included an extension of the holiday, with citizens told to stay inside as much as possible. Officially the holiday was extended by only three days, but many cities and provinces pushed the deadline until Feb 10. The measures have left businesses, shops, factories and tourist sites closed and turned many cities into ghost towns, sparking concerns about the impact of the outbreak on the economy. But there were some signs Monday of the country beginning to make a return to normality. Roads in Beijing and Shanghai had significantly more traffic than in recent days and the southern city of Guangzhou said it would start to resume normal public transport from Monday. The city had been running a partial service due to the epidemic, said city authorities - who reminded people to continue avoiding crowded places. WORK, INTERRUPTED However, tens of millions of people in Hubei province were not returning to work, as the province - the epicentre of the outbreak - remained under lockdown with travel links cut off. Many companies were offering staff the option of working from home.   Car manufacturer Volkswagen said while some of its factories would re-open on Monday, others had delayed production for another week. Toyota has extended the closure of its Chinese plants to Feb 16. Many factories involved in manufacturing medical equipment had already returned to work. According to the National Development and Reform Commission, around 87 per cent of the country's medical mask production had already resumed. China's central bank said it would make 300 billion yuan (US$43 billion) available in special loans to banks from Monday to help businesses involved in fighting the epidemic. But the tourism industry remains in the doldrums, with several countries banning arrivals from China, major airlines suspending flights and international and domestic tour groups being halted. Schools and universities across the country remained closed. 'TIP OF THE ICEBERG' The death toll from the novel coronavirus has overtaken global fatalities in the 2002-03 SARS epidemic. China drew international condemnation for covering up cases during the SARS outbreak, but the WHO has praised the measures Beijing has taken this time.   However, the health body has warned that the figures could still ""shoot up"". Ian Lipkin - a professor at Columbia University who worked with China on the SARS outbreak - also warned of the risk of a ""bump"" in infection cases when people return to work. WHO chief Tedros said there had been some ""concerning instances"" of cases overseas in people with no travel history to China. ""The detection of a small number of cases may indicate more widespread transmission in other countries; in short, we may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg"", he tweeted. Meanwhile in Hong Kong, thousands of people stranded aboard the World Dream cruise ship for five days were allowed to disembark Sunday after its 1,800 crew tested negative for the new coronavirus. The ship carried three Chinese passengers to Vietnam between Jan 19 and 24 who were later found to be infected with the SARS-like coronavirus. Health authorities in the semi-autonomous Asian financial hub said the crew and a similar number of passengers had been released from quarantine.

04 Feb 2020 08:26AM,China to allow in US health experts as coronavirus shows no sign of slowing,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners GENEVA: China has agreed to allow US health experts into the country as part of a World Health Organisation (WHO) effort to help fight the fast-spreading coronavirus, as the number of cases and deaths continued to mount. A WHO spokesman said on Monday (Feb 3) that the WHO-led international team of experts could go to China as early as this week to investigate the coronavirus outbreak, as agreed between the WHO chief and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The number of confirmed deaths from the outbreak in China spiked to 425, after authorities in Hubei province reported 64 new fatalities on Tuesday. The number of cases has also surpassed 20,000 in the country. China accused the United States on Monday of whipping up panic over the fast-spreading coronavirus with travel restrictions and evacuations. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said last week on return from Beijing that the international mission would be composed of WHO officials and possibly consultants. Tedros, asked at the time specifically about US Health Secretary Alex Azar publicly calling for US officials to be part of a WHO-led mission, said that countries should make ""bilateral arrangements"". WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic, in response to a Reuters query on Monday, said: ""A multidisciplinary mission of international experts to China will take place, possibly this week. Both China and WHO agreed on this mission. ""The mission is an international technical mission led by WHO. As such, CDC could be part of it,"" he said, referring to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The experts would have a range of specialisations, including epidemiology, laboratories, research and development, and would work with Chinese counterparts to help guide global response efforts, he said. Chen Xu, China's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told a news briefing last Friday where he was asked about any objection to US participation, said: ""We are not intentionally denying any kind of help from any particular country."" China on Monday accused the United States of spreading fear by pulling its nationals out and restricting travel instead of offering significant aid. Washington has ""unceasingly manufactured and spread panic"", Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.

06 Feb 2020 08:15PM,Indonesia says no need to test citizens evacuated from Wuhan for novel coronavirus as they are healthy,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners JAKARTA: A senior Indonesian health official said there is no need to conduct novel coronavirus tests on citizens quarantined after being evacuated from Wuhan, as all 243 people were healthy. Speaking at a press conference on Thursday (Feb 6), Dr Windra Waworuntu, the Health Ministry’s director for communicable diseases said: “We don’t take swab samples because they are well. The SOP (standard operating procedure) doesn’t say that we have to take samples from everyone."" “If they are not well, feverish, coughing and sneezing, then we will swab (them for samples). If they are fine, why should we swab?”   On Sunday, Indonesia evacuated 238 students from Hubei province, where the novel coronavirus is thought to have originated amid a lockdown by Chinese authorities. All 238 students and five officials from the Indonesian embassy in China who assisted the students’ return, were subsequently quarantined at a military facility in the remote Indonesian island of Natuna for the next two weeks. COST IS AN ISSUE: HEALTH MINISTRY Dr Waworuntu said that it would be costly to test all those currently under quarantine. The reagent - a compound used in chemical analysis to detect coronavirus - involved for one test would cost a billion rupiah (US$73,035), she claimed. Each person is tested at least twice to ensure accuracy. “But that doesn’t mean we won’t do it when we have to. We will.” When asked if the current approach is in line with guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Waworuntu said Indonesia is complying with all guidelines and recommendations currently set by the international body. The director said Indonesia will only tighten the current policy if it is mandated by the WHO. “The guidelines set by the WHO is constantly updated. Perhaps tomorrow will be different,” she said. “But from the guidelines we have received so far, that is the standard.”   Dr Waworuntu said doctors are constantly monitoring the health of everyone being quarantined in Natuna. To date, the virus has killed more than 550 people and infected over 28,000 people around the world. The WHO has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency as the virus spread to at least 25 countries and regions. But Indonesia, a country of 264 million people, appeared to be spared from the outbreak, even as neighbouring countries like Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Australia each has confirmed cases of novel coronavirus. Indonesia has earlier tested 42 people for the novel coronavirus since the outbreak began last month. But all tests came back negative. Some have questioned if Indonesia has the right tools to detect the virus. ""EVERYTHING IN LINE WITH WHO PROTOCOL"" Dr Waworuntu said Indonesia would continue to make preparations for a possible outbreak. “Indonesia is doing everything in line with (WHO) protocol. We are making preparations and continue to increase our capacity,” she said.   Indonesia has readied 100 hospitals across the country to isolate and treat suspected novel coronavirus patients but Dr Waworuntu said the government plans to have more. “We are checking the readiness of hospitals, outside of the 100 so each province has at least one,” she said. Indonesia has 34 provinces. The Health Ministry director said her office is also improving laboratories across the country so they are able to conduct test and diagnosis for the novel coronavirus. Currently, all samples are being tested at the ministry’s biomedical research centre in Jakarta. “We want laboratories outside of Jakarta to be able to conduct tests and diagnosis. So not only at our research centre, but labs in Jakarta, Surabaya, Manado, Papua, Makassar and Sumatra,” she said, adding that it would save time and minimise the chances of the samples being contaminated or damaged along the way.

12 Feb 2020 03:19PM,"DBS employee infected with novel coronavirus, some staff told to work from home","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: DBS on Wednesday (Feb 12) confirmed an employee had been infected with the novel coronavirus, prompting the bank to take precautionary measures and have some employees at Marina Bay Financial Centre work from home. The infected employee was tested on Tuesday and the bank was informed of the confirmation on Wednesday morning, said DBS in a media statement. As a precaution, employees in the affected office space were told to work from home. ""As a precautionary measure, as at 12pm today, we ensured that all employees on the affected floor at Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 3 vacated the premises, to work from home,"" it said. The bank said it was conducting contact tracing with all employees and other people the infected person may have come into contact with.   The affected office space and common areas are being deep cleaned and disinfected according to the health ministry's guidelines, it added. ""During this difficult time, the bank will be providing this employee and his family with every support and guidance,"" said DBS. A total of 300 staff members at level 43 of the Marina Bay Financial Centre have been ""evacuated"" as a precautionary measure and will work from home, the bank told staff members in an internal memo seen by CNA. CARE PACKS TO INCLUDE VITAMIN C, THERMOMETER All bank employees will receive a ""personal hygiene and protection care pack with effect from next week. The pack will include a thermometer, hand sanitiser and vitamin C, said DBS. It said it was also rolling out webinars for medical health professionals to update employees and provide further information, and also had a medical helpline and services to virtual doctors. The bank has also put in place plans for employees to work from home or from split sites ""to ensure minimal disruption to operations"". Long lines had formed this week to enter some offices in the financial district as employers started screening workers for temperature. Warnings by building management of cases in some downtown office buildings have also been widely shared on social media. A total of 47 people have tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Singapore so far. As of Tuesday, nine of these have since recovered. The virus, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 20 countries. More than 1,000 people have died and more than 44,000 people have been infected, the vast majority in China.

04 Feb 2020 07:04AM,China coronavirus death toll soars past 400,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The number of confirmed deaths from the coronavirus outbreak spiked to 426 in China, after authorities in Hubei province reported 64 new fatalities and Hong Kong reported its first fatality on Tuesday (Feb 4). In its daily update, figures from the health commission in Hubei, which has been hit hardest by the virus, also showed a sharp increase in confirmed infections with 3,235 new cases. That puts the national total at more than 20,400, based on numbers previously issued by the central government.   The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency, although experts say much is still unknown about the pathogen including its lethality. ""We expect to see more cases of person-to-person spread,"" said Dr Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The epidemic is believed to have emerged in December from a market that sold wild game in the Hubei provincial capital Wuhan. At least 151 cases have been reported in 23 other countries and regions, including Japan, Thailand, Singapore, the United States and Britain. There has been one death outside China, in the Philippines.   With Wuhan and some other cities in virtual lockdown, travel severely restricted and China facing increasing international isolation, fears of wider economic disruption are growing; sources at the OPEC oil cartel said producers were considering cutting output by almost a third to support prices. Airlines around the world have stopped flights to parts of China. A suspension by the United Arab Emirates on Monday will affect the Gulf airlines Etihad and Emirates. The outbreak is reminiscent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a virus from the same family that emerged in China in 2002 and killed almost 800 people around the world out of the 8,000 or so who were infected. Chinese data suggest that the new virus, while much more contagious than SARS, is significantly less lethal, although such numbers can evolve rapidly. Some economists predict world economic output will be cut by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points due to China's lockdown. Countries continued to fly evacuation flights for citizens out of Wuhan. A planeload of Australians left the city on Monday and arrived in the Indian Ocean territory of Christmas Island, where they will be quarantined, media reported on Tuesday. The United States, which flew people out last week, is planning ""a handful more flights"" while Russia was due to start evacuating its citizens from Wuhan on Monday. The White House said China had accepted its offer to have US experts as part of a WHO mission to study and help combat the virus.

06 Feb 2020 10:04PM,Condition worsens for 2 coronavirus patients in Singapore: MOH,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The condition of two coronavirus patients in Singapore has worsened, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Thursday (Feb 6). ""One is now in critical condition in the intensive care unit, and another requires additional oxygen support,"" it said in a press release. Two new cases were also confirmed by the ministry on Thursday, bringing the total number of cases in Singapore to 30. Both new cases are in a stable condition, MOH said. Among the earlier 28 confirmed cases, one has been discharged. Most of the other patients are ""stable or improving,"" MOH said. As of noon on Thursday, 310 of the suspect cases have tested negative for the coronavirus. Test results for the remaining 147 cases are pending, the ministry added. ONE PATIENT DISCHARGED SO FAR The first patient to be discharged was a 35-year-old man from Wuhan who was Singapore’s seventh confirmed case. He had been “comprehensively tested negative” for the coronavirus, the ministry said on Feb 4. His symptoms had “fully resolved” and consecutive tests over three days all came back negative, MOH’s director of medical services Kenneth Mak had told a press conference. The man had tested positive for the coronavirus on Jan 27. He arrived in Singapore four days before and went to Raffles Hospital after he developed symptoms on Jan 24. He was then transferred to NCID. Singapore on Saturday widened travel restrictions to stop all new visitors of any nationality with recent travel history to mainland China from entering Singapore. These visitors are also not allowed to transit in Singapore. The virus, believed to have originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has killed more than 560 people and infected more than 28,000, the vast majority of them in China. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the virus outbreak a global emergency.

11 Feb 2020 06:15AM,‘Not enough manpower to get food to people in need’: Food charities hit as coronavirus measures ramped up,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Groups that help feed families in need have seen most volunteers drop out. And they worry about the impact of panic-buying on the flow of food donations. SINGAPORE: As some Singaporeans hunker down and stock up on food essentials in the face of the coronavirus outbreak, charities and volunteer groups are concerned about the impact on their ability to get supplies of food out to those relying on their help. Since the Government raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Friday, schools and companies have curtailed many activities, while anxious shoppers emptied the shelves at NTUC FairPrice outlets and wet markets. Some charity groups like Free Food For All (FFA), which provides free cooked meals and rations to low-income Singaporeans, are worried about what the stockpiling by consumers could mean for donations. “I see a potential hit on the amount of food donations we will receive,” said FFA’s founder Nizar Mohd Shariff. “We typically receive (from retailers) food that is not sold or near expiry – but if items are flying off the shelves, what’s left to be given to us?” The kind of mentality spurring the panic-buying is also worrying. “On normal days, people think, ‘I’ll donate if I have enough.’ But when people are hoarding stuff out of fear, donations would be the last thing on their mind.”   To discourage stockpiling, NTUC FairPrice has since placed limits on the purchase of high-demand items like rice, and reassured customers that it has ready stock of essential items. Food From The Heart’s (FFTH) chief executive Sim Bee Hia is concerned about how this might impact donations through its NTUC Shop & Donate scheme, where the public can order food staples to be delivered to a charity. This “has always been a steady source of food for us, especially rice”, said Ms Sim. SHARP DROP IN VOLUNTEERS But a far more urgent concern for the food assistance groups is the drying-up of their pool of volunteers in the past week or so. “There isn’t enough manpower to get food out to people in need,” said Ms Nichol Ng, co-founder of The Food Bank Singapore. People are forgetting that while this virus is going on, people in need still need to eat and life goes on. At FFTH, Ms Sim said she was “scrambling” to find volunteers to pack almost 2,000 food ration packs by the end of this week. A desperate call was put out on Facebook. “From Jan 31 till now, about 12 volunteer sessions with corporations and schools, who were supposed to help with the packing of food rations, were cancelled,” she said. “There were also individuals who signed up but were a no-show.”   The Food Bank Singapore relies on students to sort out and process public donations of canned food, biscuits and other groceries, or huge pallets of food from industry donors, before these can be redirected to beneficiaries. But since cases of the novel coronavirus began cropping up in Singapore, groups have been cancelling. “Our student volunteer pool has been wiped out,” said Ms Ng, adding that beneficiaries who have been getting rations from them twice a month “may only get it once a month”. The Food Bank also has a programme where companies, as part of a corporate responsibility programme for staff, can buy items that beneficiaries need, pack them, and go distributing door to door. “But now there’s none of that… The total food donation volume is down by 50 per cent,” said Ms Ng. For Willing Hearts, a cooked food charity that provides 6,500 free meals a day islandwide, the lack of manpower means it now takes longer to prepare and deliver food.   “Companies are telling employees to stay home, while school volunteers have completely disappeared in the last two weeks,” said Mr Teh Eng Hua, the president of Willing Hearts. But do or die, the charities that CNA Insider spoke to are doing all they can to get food to those who need it. They rely on their few staff and the odd volunteers who still turn up to help. The Food Bank is appealing to companies that can’t volunteer their time for now, to donate money instead so that it can buy the provisions needed to continue its service to beneficiaries. SPARE A THOUGHT FOR THEM FFTH is determined that its beneficiaries see no disruption to their food supply. “For the lower-income and vulnerable groups, seeing the empty supermarket shelves would have brought a sense of uneasiness because they are already struggling financially,” said Ms Sim. That’s why we need to honour our commitment. Food should be the last thing they are worried about. The good news is that those in need can turn to other sources of free food – like community fridges in Yishun stocked by donors and food rescuers, and FFTH’s The Community Shop @ Mountbatten just launched on Saturday.   While shoppers were packing supermarkets the day after DORSCON Orange was declared, Ms Sim said: “It was humbling to see that our beneficiaries were getting what they needed (at our free shop) without having to go through the frenzy at Sheng Shiong or NTUC FairPrice.” Indeed, the weekend’s binge-buying had charities appealing to Singaporeans to think of the impact of their actions on the low-income group. For instance, Ms Ng pointed out that those on assistance get NTUC FairPrice vouchers to buy groceries – and if the shelves were empty, they’d be forced to find the cash to buy elsewhere. She added: “We can’t stop people from panic buying. But if they really want to buy stuff, they could think of those in need and buy some for us as well,” Ms Sim took a lighter perspective. “I hope people realise that they bought too much,” she said with a laugh. “And then they’ll donate to us.” HOW YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE Food From The Heart: To volunteer, visit https://www.foodfromtheheart.sg or WhatsApp 81280432 Food Bank Singapore: To donate, visit https://www.giving.sg/the-food-bank-singapore-ltd Free Food For All: To donate or volunteer, visit https://freefood.org.sg National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre: To volunteer or donate to various COVID-19 charity efforts, visit https://www.giving.sg/sgunited TOUCH Community Services: To volunteer for Meals-On-Wheels delivery, call 68046565 Willing Hearts: To volunteer, visit http://www.willinghearts.org.sg It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

05 Feb 2020 12:28PM,"Shortage of face masks in JB amid coronavirus scare, some retailers selling above price ceiling","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners JOHOR BAHRU: Concerns about the novel coronavirus have sparked a shortage of face masks in Johor, with some smaller retailers seen charging above the price ceiling imposed by the government. The authorities, however, said they have found no evidence of profiteering. The southern state has become the frontline of Malaysia’s battle against the virus, with seven out of ten confirmed cases across the country detected in Johor Bahru. Stocks for face masks and hand sanitisers across the city have depleted over the last week. When CNA visited several major pharmacies on Monday (Feb 3), including those in JB Sentral, Jalan Wang Ah Fook and Taman Sri Tebrau, masks were out of stock.   Face masks and hand sanitisers were also sold out at Apex pharmacy at JB City Square as well as Guardian Pharmacy and Caring Pharmacy at JBCC Komtar.   In a Facebook post last Thursday, the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs' (KPDNHEP) branch in Johor state said the government had imposed price ceilings for five different types of face masks.   While the major pharmacies were selling the masks at or below the price ceiling, some of the smaller retailers visited by CNA were selling them at a higher price. At Taman Sri Tebrau, face masks were being sold at a Chinese traditional medicine shop and a grocery store at above the price ceilings. The traditional medicine store was selling three-layer surgical masks at RM9 (US$2.18) per pack. This means that the masks cost RM0.90 each, RM0.10 more than the capped amount. The face masks, which were stored in transparent zip-lock bags, were taken from a room at the back of the shop. The shop owner, who declined to be named, told CNA that he was not aware of any regulation on the price of face masks. Over at the grocery store, each three-layer surgical mask was going for RM1. This was RM0.20 above the price ceiling. The masks were stored in a cardboard box underneath the counter. The owner declined to comment on why he was pricing the masks above the set limit.   Furthermore, a stationery store at Jalan Wang Ah Fook also quoted RM8 for each N95 mask, RM2 above the price cap of RM6. The store was located close to a Big Pharmacy outlet, which had run out of stock for face masks. A staff member from the outlet told CNA that workers from neighbouring stores would snap up face masks in ""large quantities"" before re-selling them for a profit. ""I've seen them buying the masks by the boxes when they realise that the pharmacy's stock has arrived. It's not right but there's not much we can do,"" said the staff member who declined to be named.   Over at Taman Mount Austin, more non-pharmaceutical retailers were also selling face masks for a profit. A florist shop located near a Guardian pharmacy outlet was selling two-layer surgical masks for RM10 per pack of 10. This was a whopping RM0.80 more than the capped amount of RM0.20 per mask. The shop owner said that he did not usually sell face masks but decided to stock up because customers were requesting for them. ""I ordered a shipment from a supplier in Pasir Gudang and the boxes just arrived this week. I think RM10 for 10 face masks is a reasonable price,"" he said. There was also huge disparity in prices at different stores. An electronics store in Taman Mount Austin was selling Arax Japanese Pitta masks at RM3 for a pack of three. However, a provision store nearby was selling the same product for RM15.90, more than five times the amount.   Mr Ivan Yeo, who purchased the masks at the provision store said the authorities should ensure that all face masks are priced fairly and consistently across different retailers. ""We as customers are not sure. It's so difficult to find places that have stock for face masks so we tend to just buy when the stores are selling them,"" said Mr Yeo. NO EVIDENCE OF PROFITEERING: AUTHORITIES When contacted, a spokesperson for Johor KPDNHEP said checks on retailers across Johor Bahru were conducted over the last week following complaints regarding profiteering.   The checks were conducted at shops across Johor Bahru in Bukit Indah, Mount Austin, Setia Eco Park and Taman Daya. The spokesperson noted that although stocks for face masks were depleted at most outlets, there were no evidence of masks being sold at prices above the maximum ceiling. In Malaysia, face masks are regulated under the Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act 2011. Those caught will face a maximum fine of RM100,000 or imprisonment of up to three years, or both. Errant companies could be fined up to RM500,000. CNA has contacted the Johor State Government for comment on further enforcement action on errant retailers, as well as plans on how to ensure there is sufficient stock for face masks for residents in Johor. Meanwhile, pharmacies located near to the causeway said some Singaporeans had been making bulk purchases. Ms Uvarani Kothandan, the manager for Caring Pharmacy’s outlet in JB Sentral, told CNA that the masks at her store were purchased “mostly by Singaporeans” as they were heading towards the immigration clearance at Bandar Sultan Iskandar. “They were mostly families carrying Singapore passports. Many came over during the recent Chinese New Year holidays and bought the mask and sanitisers in bulk,” said Ms Uvarani. Ms Jocelyn Wu, a Singaporean customer at the store who was looking to purchase face masks and hand sanitisers, said buying in Johor Bahru made financial sense as the items were cheaper. Last week, the Singapore government said each Singapore household will receive four surgical masks from the national stockpile. The move to distribute masks came after long queues and empty shelves for face masks were seen at retailers across Singapore. Then, Singapore's Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing had warned against the tendency to panic buy and hoard face masks. ""Such behaviour - they are not appropriate, they are selfish and they are not helpful to our collective defence,"" he said.

03 Feb 2020 05:17PM,In full: Gan Kim Yong's ministerial statement on whole-of-Government response to novel coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Health Minister Gan Kim Yong spoke in Parliament on Monday (Feb 3) on the whole-of-Government efforts to combat the novel coronavirus that has infected thousands worldwide. Here is his speech in full: Mr Speaker, members. Many members of this house and our fellow Singaporeans are concerned about the 2019 novel coronavirus. This virus has affected not only China but many countries worldwide, and cases are still growing daily with no signs of abating yet. The Singapore Government has set up a Multi-Ministry Taskforce to coordinate the whole of Government efforts to combat this outbreak even before the first confirmed imported case occurred here. On Jan 30, the World Health Organization declared that the outbreak constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, raising the global alert levels. We have therefore put in place pre-emptive measures, to protect the public health. Some other countries have also done so. It is heartening to know that China is doing all they can to contain the spread of the virus, and we have witnessed their decisive actions to put in place strong measures, such as travel restrictions for their own residents, cancellation of outbound tour groups, and bringing back residents from overseas. We wish China well in their efforts to combat this virus, and we have every confidence that China and other countries, including us here in Singapore, will work together and complement each other to win this battle internationally. This is not just a problem for China, but for the world. We have to work together and collaborate with each other. For this reason, Singapore will be putting together an assistance package to help the communities in China affected by the novel coronavirus. More details of the package will be provided later. I understand why Singaporeans are concerned, as there are many unknowns about the virus, how it will develop, and how long this will last. Beyond health, businesses would also have concerns and many have been affected by our prevention and containment measures. Let me take this opportunity to provide some background on the virus, give an update on the current situation, and touch on the healthcare-related measures that we have put in place. Minister Wong, my co-chair of the Taskforce, will provide more details on the efforts of the various government agencies and how we are working together with all the stakeholders. As the situation unfolds, we will share as much information as possible and as soon as possible. While we cannot be complacent, I am confident we will overcome this challenge as we have in the past if we work together. We have been preparing for this, we are anticipating scenarios ahead, taking decisive actions as the situation evolves, and we will do our best to keep Singapore and Singaporeans safe. SITUATION UPDATE First, let me start with an update. The situation in China and globally is still developing rapidly even as we speak, and we still have very limited knowledge of the virus as scientists all over the world are racing against time to understand this virus better. The virus was first detected in Wuhan, in December 2019, although it may well have existed earlier while remained undetected. On Dec 31, the World Health Organization (WHO) was first informed of a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause detected in Wuhan. Soon after, on Jan 2, MOH alerted our medical professionals, and effected temperature screening for all flights arriving from Wuhan at our airport. The infection continued to spread in China. By Jan 22, 2020, over 500 confirmed cases were reported in China with a death toll of 17, when we decided to set up a Multi-Ministry Taskforce. We anticipated that we will need a whole-of-government effort to respond swiftly to this threat when it arrives in Singapore. We had to take precautions, and coordinate plans across Government agencies to fight this. In fact, the following day, after we had set up the taskforce, we saw the first local imported case. Wuhan and additional cities in Hubei were then locked down by the Chinese Government. By this time, we had already issued travel advisories for Wuhan, and extended our temperature screening at our airport to all incoming flights from China. The infection continued to spread at a rapid pace, reaching several foreign countries and all provinces of China by Jan 29, 2020. Latest WHO report showed that there were more than 14,000 reported cases in China and 304 deaths. 23 countries had also reported a total of 146 confirmed cases and one death. The number is changing every day. Locally, we have 18 confirmed cases. 43 recently admitted suspect cases are pending test results, while 240 suspect cases were tested and cleared. All of the confirmed cases are being treated in isolation rooms. Overall, the conditions of most of our confirmed cases are improving. To date, there is no evidence of local community transmission. However, we should not be complacent and we must be prepared for this scenario.  EPIDEMIOLOGY OF NOVEL CORONAVIRUS Let me now share about what we know about this novel coronavirus. The virus comes from the family of coronavirus, which includes other viruses such as MERS and SARS, as well as the milder variance causing common cold. The medical consensus at this moment is that the novel coronavirus is more transmissible, but appears less deadly than SARS. Transmission: Available evidence suggests that the rate of human-to-human transmission of this virus appears to be higher than that of SARS. For now, the evidence also suggests that transmission is mostly via droplets. What this means is that the virus is carried within droplets emitted from an infected person over a short distance, such as when the person coughs or sneezes. If these droplets come into contact with the eyes, nose or mouth of an individual, directly or indirectly through hands that have come into contact with these droplets, the individual may become infected. To clarify, there is no evidence currently to suggest that the virus is airborne. There are other viruses, such as chickenpox, which can easily be transported via air currents, and do not require droplets to contact the eyes or nose. The novel coronavirus is not in this category of viruses. The novel coronavirus could also transmit through surface contact. When a person sneezes or coughs, the droplets fall onto the surfaces of tables and chairs for example and the virus may remain alive for up to a few days. When someone else touches the surfaces, the virus can be transferred to his hand and if he then rubs his eyes or nose without washing his hands, he may become infected. So we should wash our hands. This is also why we only quarantine the close contacts of confirmed cases. For more transient contacts, such as individuals that the confirmed cases may have walked past in malls or hotels, the risk of transmission is low. For coronavirus generally, the person is most infectious when he is displaying symptoms or symptomatic, and this is likely to be the case for the novel coronavirus as well. There is evidence of limited spread from a person without symptoms, during the incubation period. However, this form of transmission may be uncommon, and] has so far involved isolated cases only. At this point, the evidence still points towards higher transmissibility when the person is displaying symptoms. As such, medical professionals both overseas and in Singapore have advised that the most effective way that we can protect ourselves is to practice good personal hygiene. We should regularly wash our hands with soap and water, and avoid touching our face with our hands. These may sound simple, but are effective in preventing all kinds of infection. Potential infection from asymptomatic persons is less likely to be from coughing or sneezing directly, but more likely by touching contaminated surfaces, for which masks offer no protection. Wearing a mask when we are well often give us a false sense of security instead, and we are more likely to touch our faces when we constantly adjust our masks, which is one way the disease spreads. At the same time, we need to protect others – our loved ones, friends, colleagues and fellow Singaporeans that we come into contact with. If we are sick, we should rest and recover at home as far as possible. If we do need to go out to see a doctor, for example, we should wear a surgical mask to protect others. So this is when a mask is needed – when we are unwell and have to go out. Symptoms and treatment: Persons exposed to the virus may be well for a few days, before developing symptoms such as fever, or cough and some may develop pneumonia eventually. There is currently no known curative treatment for the novel coronavirus. Development of a successful cure may take time, may be months or years. The current approach is to provide good supportive care for the patients to reduce complications and to allow time for the patient to recover. The current case fatality rate stands at about 2 per cent to 3 per cent. Majority of the deaths are among those with underlying medical conditions. The fatality rate seems lower than SARS, which was around 10 per cent but we are still at the initial stages of the outbreak and the actual severity can only be assessed properly in time to come. Regardless, the Government’s response has been, and will continue to be swift and decisive, to contain the spread of the virus here. Let me elaborate on the preparations we have made and measures we have taken. PREPARATION FOR THE VIRUS We have been preparing for the possibility of an infectious disease outbreak like this one since SARS. We have been building capacity and capability in addressing infectious diseases, such as SARS, MERS, H1N1, and more recently Zika and Monkey Pox. We had strengthened our epidemiological surveillance and containment capabilities, and our agencies hold regular emergency preparedness exercises to keep themselves operationally ready. In addition, we have set up the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), a purpose-built facility to strengthen our ability to manage the outbreak of infectious diseases. It is benchmarked to international standards and best practices for treatment and safety. In April 2018, a Joint External Evaluation by the WHO experts stated that Singapore had demonstrated strong leadership and high capacity to detect and respond to potential public health emergencies. We had followed the situation in Wuhan closely since December 2019 and we had responded rapidly, putting in place a series of measures to reduce the risk of import and spread of the virus since early January 2020. These include the implementation of temperature screening at the airport, and we also alerted all our medical practitioners to be vigilant. Once we saw a significant increase in confirmed cases in Wuhan, I decided that it was necessary to set up a Multi-Ministry Taskforce. I asked Minister Lawrence Wong to co-chair this, and invited DPM as our advisor. The taskforce is to plan and coordinate whole-of-Government efforts, so that we can mount a national response quickly and effectively. Representatives from the Ministry of Home Affairs, Social and Family, Transport, Education, Manpower, Trade and Industry, Communications and Information, Environment and Water Resources and the labour movement are all involved. The list is very long, but it is a reflection of the multi-agency coordination that is required. As the global and local situation evolves, the taskforce has stepped up our measures accordingly, taking into careful consideration relevant factors, including the impact on our society. MULTIPLE LINES OF DEFENCE We had set up multiple lines of defence to reduce the risk of imported cases and local community transmission. We have been stepping up our posture and efforts at each line of defence. First, we have measures that serve to prevent further importation of the virus into our shores. These include temperature and health screening at all checkpoints, land, sea, and air, as well as international travel controls. Second, we have measures that help us to detect and contain the virus, and prevent it from spreading further. We have good surveillance systems to identify cases. Our healthcare providers, especially our polyclinics and General Practitioners (GPs), are right at the front line. They are on heightened alert and stand ready to deal with cases as they emerge. Third, and perhaps most importantly, all of us must play our part and exercise social responsibility, to prevent or stem any possible spread of the coronavirus in the community. We should also be considerate for others around us and lend a hand as a community to support each other and stay united. None of these measures on their own are fool-proof. But when taken together, they will improve our resilience and ability to respond to this disease. Let me elaborate on the key roles that the healthcare system plays in the defence of this novel coronavirus. Minister Wong will touch on the other measures. KEY ROLE OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS Detection and Isolation of confirmed and suspected cases: Our healthcare providers play a key role in the detection and isolation of suspected and confirmed cases. Our frontline doctors – polyclinics, GPs and Emergency Department doctors are on high alert for persons with travel history and respiratory symptoms such as fever and cough. Such persons will be assessed, isolated and tested for the novel coronavirus. We also test samples from our influenza surveillance systems and hospitalised pneumonia cases for novel coronavirus to pick up unlinked cases, if any. Let me take the opportunity to provide an update on the confirmed and suspected cases. All of our confirmed cases are Wuhan residents, or persons who had recently travelled to Wuhan. There is no evidence of community spread in Singapore. Many of them stayed mostly at their hotels, or with their family in their family’s homes, and did not move around extensively. However, some of them did visit our tourism sites, such as Gardens by the Bay and Orchard Road, where any interactions would have been transient. The confirmed cases are being treated at the various hospitals, and their conditions are stable and most of them are improving. With each confirmed case, we will conduct contact tracing. We will check on the health of these contacts, and if they are unwell with fever, cough or other respiratory symptoms, they will be classified as suspected cases. We will arrange for them to go to hospital via a dedicated ambulance for isolation and testing. For contacts that are well, we adopt a risk-based approach. For close contacts, they will be put under quarantine for 14 days since their last contact with the confirmed case. For other contacts, they will be put on active surveillance with daily health checks by MOH, as the risk of infection is lower for them. The detection and management of suspect cases and proper care and isolation of these confirmed cases would not have been possible without our healthcare providers and professionals. They are our key partners in this war against the novel coronavirus. Our polyclinics and GP partners play an important role in identifying and notifying MOH of any cases that meet the case definition so that they can be followed up. Dr Lam Pin Min and I recently met a group of GPs, including representatives from the Singapore Medical Association (SMA), and the College of Family Physicians Singapore (CFPS), to hear their feedback and to see how we can support them. Our hospitals will similarly isolate any individuals that present themselves at the emergency department who meet the case definition and test them to determine whether they are infected with the novel coronavirus. I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to all our healthcare workers and their families. They have worked tirelessly over the last few weeks, missing their holidays or reunion dinners. They work very hard to keep Singaporeans and Singapore safe. Their families may also need to take over caregiving roles at home, or make alternative arrangements as these healthcare workers work overtime to manage the cases. Let me give you an example: Dr Margaret Soon, the Director of Nursing at NCID. She is an exemplary leader. She was a veteran from SARS, and an Infection Control Nurse. Dr Soon immediately rose to the occasion when we activated NCID. She led her team to prepare the isolation rooms, held townhalls to update the NCID nurses, and ensured that her nurses had adequate essential supplies such as protective gowns and masks. Throughout this period, she was out of the house before sunrise, and mostly back only after her family have gone to sleep. She had to cancel a family trip during the Chinese New Year period, but her family understood and was supportive. This included her daughter, whom she was pregnant with during SARS. Stories of such dedication like Dr Soon’s abound in our healthcare community. I would also like to emphasise that there is no need to avoid our healthcare workers during this time. We have instituted strict safety policies and procedures at our hospitals and other healthcare providers. For example, healthcare workers managing cases are required to don personal protective equipment, and this ensures that they are protected from the virus. Instead, let us stand behind them and support them in this period. They may be our friends and family, or even strangers that we meet on the streets or public places. A smile, a kind word or an encouraging message goes a long way to help them keep their spirits up, and know that we are behind them. I am also very encouraged by our various community-led efforts. For example, Akram Hanif and his youth volunteers have been engaging a group of about 45 young adolescents and youths at Marsiling CC to instill in them good values and character. Akram had organised the kids to draw a banner to thank our frontline medical staff from the Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) and encourage them to press on. PREPARING FOR ROAD AHEAD There could be a long road ahead. SARS took about eight months from the first detected case in November 2002 till the WHO declared the SARS outbreak contained in July 2003. We are not sure how long this virus will turn out. Therefore, we must stand ready to respond to new developments as the situation evolves. There remain risks ahead, and we are preparing for the various contingencies. Let me share some of these scenarios. First, there could be community spread in more Chinese cities beyond Wuhan or in other countries. We may need to roll out additional measures to prevent importation and to contain the virus. The decision to do so would again not be an easy one. We have to do what is necessary to protect the health and safety of our people and those who travel to Singapore. Secondly, there could be community spread locally. Despite our best efforts, this is a possibility we must be ready for. The key to managing this is quick detection and limiting further spread, which calls on social responsibility from all of us. If the infected Singaporean wears a mask to protect others, and promptly sees a doctor and gets triaged for testing, the risk of further spread can be greatly reduced. Even if there is spread, quick action will help to limit its extent. Once tested positive, the Government will contact trace quickly, helping to reduce further spread to their close contacts. If the community spread becomes very extensive, we will need to consider measures to reduce human to human interactions, such as cancelling mass gatherings, suspending schools, paring down non-essential care services and introducing further infection control and monitoring measures, to slow the spread. Third, the virus could mutate to become more infectious and spread widely, resulting in a pandemic. This is the known unknown, and we have to assess what best to do, depending on how the virus mutates. It may also become less infectious or less severe. But it is a scenario that we worry about when it comes. On the healthcare front, we are stepping up preparations for these potential scenarios. For example, we have increased our capacity of isolation beds by around 100 in the past two weeks. We have also been increasing our testing capacity, to enable us to more quickly confirm suspect cases. Overall, we must stay calm, but cautious. Our early intervention efforts have helped to contain the spread so far, but while we hope for the best, we must plan for the worst. CLOSING Working together: Let me conclude by once again appealing to all Singaporeans to work together with us in this fight. I am very heartened by the many examples of volunteers stepping forward to support our efforts. Indeed, this effort requires a whole-of-Singapore response. I have elaborated on the public health measures that we have put in place. Minister Wong will elaborate on the other measures. We seek Singaporeans’ understanding and cooperation. I would also like to acknowledge once again our healthcare workers on the frontlines, and commend them for their bravery and selflessness. Let’s stand together and show our support for them. Addressing anxiety: We understand that Singaporeans may feel anxious, given the many unknowns about the novel coronavirus. Here, I want to reiterate the Government’s firm commitment that we will spare no efforts in protecting our people. We will act swiftly and share information on the novel coronavirus openly and as soon as possible. Confidence for the road ahead: We have overcome several challenges as a nation in the past, such as SARS, H1N1, and Zika. In the face of this novel coronavirus, we have built up our defences, our capabilities, and we are stronger and more prepared. While we cannot be complacent, we must remain calm, and confident. This is a fight that calls on every individual to do our part. We are confident that we can manage and overcome this challenge as a nation, and emerge stronger together.

09 Feb 2020 09:34PM,Fourth case of coronavirus found in UK; patient linked to Briton who had been in Singapore,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners LONDON: A fourth case of the new coronavirus has been diagnosed in Britain after a patient contracted the illness from a previously confirmed British case while in France, health officials said on Sunday (Feb 9). Last week a British national tested positive after returning to Britain from Singapore, becoming the third confirmed case of the virus. He is believed to have stayed in France for a few days on his way home, passing the virus on to others there. ""A further patient has tested positive for novel coronavirus in England, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to four,"" Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer for England, said in a statement. ""The new case is a known contact of a previously confirmed UK case, and the virus was passed on in France.""   French authorities said they were retracing all the people who might have been in close contact with a group of 11 Britons exposed to the virus after sharing lodgings in the Alpine ski resort of Les Contamines-Montjoie. Five of those tested positive, French health officials said on Saturday, including a 9-year-old and his father. Two other children - the infected child's siblings - were hospitalised in France for checks, officials added. Their mother had left the country by the time authorities began their investigation and was under observation in Britain, French media reported. The French cases have been linked back to the British man who had stayed with the family and other holidaymakers for four days in a chalet in Les Contamines-Montjoie on his way home from Singapore. In a further possible link to that man, Spanish authorities said on Sunday a British man had tested positive for coronavirus in Mallorca. He was one of four members of a British family taken into observation on Friday after coming into contact with someone in France who was subsequently diagnosed with the virus, they said. The family appear to have been part of the larger group in Les Contamines-Montjoie that included the infected British man, Fernando Simon, director of the Centre of Coordination of Health Emergencies at Spain's Health Ministry, told reporters. However he said he could not confirm this 100 per cent over respect for the family's privacy. The family returned to Mallorca from France on Jan 29 and the father started to show light symptoms 24 hours later. Simon said the man was currently ""in good health"" but was being kept in isolation and authorities were drawing up a list of everyone the man may have come into contact with in Mallorca. FINAL EVACUATION The new case in Britain was confirmed as the country's final evacuation flight from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicentre of the epidemic, landed at a Royal Air Force base in central England.   The flight from Wuhan brought 105 British nationals and their family members, as well as 95 European nationals and family members, and staff and medics who facilitated the flight, foreign minister Dominic Raab said. They will be quarantined for 14 days at a conference centre in Milton Keynes, north west of London. Barbara Woodward, Britain's ambassador to China, told Sky News that not all British nationals in Wuhan had been able to leave, including two who had failed a temperature check. Britain would work to get them on an evacuation flight chartered by another country, she said. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Copyright© Mediacorp 2020. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

11 Feb 2020 10:31AM,"Singapore tourism to take 'significant hit' in 2020 due to coronavirus, up to 30% fewer visitors expected","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The tourism sector will take a “significant hit”, with visitor arrivals estimated to fall by 25 per cent to 30 per cent this year due to the novel coronavirus outbreak, said the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) on Tuesday (Feb 11). The coronavirus outbreak has significantly impacted visitor arrivals, especially from China, which accounts for about 20 per cent of international visitor arrivals here, said STB in a media release. There were about 3.6 million visitors from China in 2019. Compared to 2018, there was a 12 per cent increase in visitors from Tier 2 Chinese cities like Jinan, Ningbo and Xiamen, it added. China was also Singapore’s top revenue market in the first three quarters of 2019, accounting for S$3.2 billion in tourism receipts excluding the sightseeing, gaming and entertainment segments, up by 2 per cent from 2018. “Visitor arrivals from STB’s other key source markets are also expected to fall due to lower travel confidence globally,” said STB. Singapore is losing an average of 18,000 to 20,000 international visitors per day and most of the lost visitor arrivals are Chinese due to travel restrictions on both sides, STB chief executive Keith Tan told media on Tuesday. He noted that the estimated decrease in visitor arrivals could change depending on how long the situation in China lasts, how long the situation in Singapore and regional economies lasts, and how long it will take for traveller demand to return. He also added that the decline in tourism receipts would be ""roughly in line"" with the decline in visitor arrivals. “We believe that the situation this year will be at least as severe as the situation we faced in 2003 during SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), probably worse.” MORE RELIANT ON CHINA FOR TOURISM NOW Adding that Singapore is more reliant on China for tourism now compared to when the SARS outbreak hit in 2003, Mr Tan noted that China accounted for just 9 per cent of visitor arrivals that year. As a result, Singapore will probably take longer to recover from the novel coronavirus outbreak than the SARS outbreak in 2003, said Mr Tan. Singapore's tourism sector saw positive year-on-year results about seven to eight months after the World Health Organization declared Singapore SARS free, he added. However, after four years of consecutive growth, the tourism authorities said the sector is aiming for a strong recovery, with a pipeline of tourism investments and efforts to build new capabilities. “Our destination remains attractive, we have a strong pipeline of tourism products, and our market portfolio is diverse,” said Mr Tan. “The growth that we have enjoyed over the past four years reflects our strong tourism fundamentals,” he added. The Government will also form a public-private sector Tourism Recovery Action Task Force (TRAC) to lay out the plans for recovery and future growth, said STB. The Task Force will comprise tourism leaders from the public and private sectors, and it will work to identify opportunities arising from the coronavirus outbreak, boost confidence in Singapore’s tourism spots and create recovery plans. The statutory board had announced on Feb 2 that licence fees for hotels, travel agents and tour guides would be waived to help Singapore’s tourism sector, which has been “directly affected” by the coronavirus outbreak. STB will also defray the cleaning costs of hotels that provided accommodation to the confirmed and suspected cases of the coronavirus. Full details of the overall package of relief measures will be announced at Budget 2020 on Feb 18. TOURISM BUSINESSES AFFECTED Business and visitor numbers for Sentosa have fallen by 20 to 50 per cent, said Mr Quek Swee Kuan, chief executive of Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC). The island had seen a 17 to 19 per cent growth in local visitorship until the virus hit Singapore, he added. Adding that Sentosa plans to waive all admission fees for the March school holidays, he also said that attractions on the island are considering different options, for example, closing on certain days of the week. Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa and Village Hotel Sentosa, the hotels that saw two guests who later became Singapore’s first and fourth confirmed cases respectively, were impacted by the news at first, said Mr Quek. “But over time now, the situation has stabilised and generally the tourists have got confidence in Singapore and Sentosa hotels. And the hotels have been complying with the MOH (Ministry of Health) guidelines to ensure that the confidence in their product remains intact.” With visitor arrivals expected to drop, hotels will use the downtime to retrain workers and conduct renovations and repairs, said Ms Kwee Wei-Lin, president of the Singapore Hotel Association. ""Hotels are taking the time (to do so), because during 90 per cent occupancy we didn't have the ability to do so; so we're fast-forwarding a lot of these renovations,"" she said. ""We got support from the Government for that during SARS, and we are doing the same thing again."" When asked whether hotels have plans to lay off or retrench staff in light of the downturn, Ms Kwee noted that there were no layoffs during the SARS period and that the hotels hope to return with all their staff. As the coronavirus situation is expected to persist, the tourism board will continue to identify ""targeted and effective ways” to support the industry and its employees, it said. STB will also maintain its plans to enhance Singapore’s destination attractiveness, with work progressing on the Mandai Nature Precinct, the Jurong Lake District, the Sentosa-Brani masterplan, the rejuvenation of Orchard Road and the expansion of the Integrated Resorts. “It is more important than ever to invest in tourism to support our businesses, build confidence in tourism, and boost our destination attractiveness – so that when things start to improve, Singapore can ride on the recovery for strong growth,” said Mr Tan. “STB remains committed to our mid- to long-term tourism plans, to ensure that Singapore has a steady pipeline of new and repeat visitors.” VISITOR ARRIVALS, TOURISM RECEIPTS GREW IN 2019 Singapore saw growth in visitor arrivals and tourism receipts for a fourth consecutive year in 2019. Visitor arrivals rose 3.3 per cent to a total of 19.1 million visitors, and they spent a total of S$27.1 billion in tourism receipts, 0.5 per cent more than in 2018. After China, Indonesia and India accounted for the second and third-most number of visitors to Singapore, with about 3.1 million and 1.4 million visitors respectively. Singapore also saw a 13 per cent increase in visitors and a 14 per cent increase in tourism receipts from the United States. This could be attributed partly to greater flight connectivity between Singapore and the United States, with new non-stop flights launched in 2019. SECTORAL PERFORMANCE While the Business Travel and Meetings, Incentive Travel, Conventions and Exhibitions (BTMICE) sector fell 7 per cent year-on-year to S$3.2 billion, Singapore continues to attract leading BTMICE events, STB said. The hotel industry performed well in 2019, with growth registered across all categories. Total gazetted hotel room revenue stood at S$4.2 billion in 2019, as average room and occupancy rates rose. Cruise passenger throughput fell 2.5 per cent to reach 1.8 million passengers. This decline is largely attributed to the dry docking of Royal Caribbean International’s Voyager of the Seas in Singapore for over a month to undergo refurbishment works, the tourism board said. However, foreign cruise throughput grew by 3.5 per cent while ship calls rose 3.2 per cent to 414, with more European liners such as AIDA Cruises and Marella Cruises contributing to the growth. Demand for cruise remained strong in 2019, with Royal Caribbean International and Genting seeing healthy occupancy for their ships, STB said.

14 Feb 2020 06:03PM,Philippines lifts Taiwan travel ban imposed over coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners MANILA: The Philippines has lifted a travel ban that was imposed on visitors from Taiwan in a bid to control the spread of the coronavirus, and will evaluate other restrictions including those on Macau, government officials said on Friday (Feb 14). The decision followed a warning by Taiwan, which has only reported 18 cases of the virus compared to more than 63,000 in China, of possible retaliation against the ban. Taiwan had complained the ban was due to the World Health Organization. The WHO considers self-ruled Taiwan a part of China, listing the island under China for virus case numbers, which Taiwan said gave a misleading impression that it had the same rampant outbreak of the disease as China. Curbs imposed on Taiwan were removed effective immediately, and its people are again free to travel to and from the Philippines, Salvador Panelo, spokesman for President Rodrigo Duterte, said in a statement. ""The lifting of travel restrictions for Taiwan has been agreed by the members of the Inter-Agency Task Force by reason of the strict measures (against the virus) they are undertaking,"" Panelo said. The decision was first confirmed to Reuters by a senior government official, who asked not to be identified prior to the signing of the order. Safeguards will be put in place, including ""heightened standard precautionary measures"" and port-of-exit screening, the official said. The Philippines health and tourism ministers confirmed the order's signing and said safety protocols would be implemented. Taiwan's Foreign Ministry welcomed the news, saying the island had the virus situation well in hand. The WHO needs to recognise that Taiwan does not come under China's remit, and make amends, it added. The ministry said the WHO's mistaken designation of Taiwan and listing it as part of China's virus area had ""misled"" the international community, causing huge problems for Taiwan's government and people. Taiwan and the Philippines have close economic ties and there are more than 115,000 Filipinos living and working in Taiwan, mainly in factories and as household helpers. Taiwan is the Philippines' fifth-largest tourist market, with 327,273 arrivals in January to November last year, up 35 per cent versus the same period in 2018, tourism ministry data showed. The coronavirus has killed more than 1,380 people, almost all in China where the outbreak originated, with one each in Hong Kong the Philippines and Japan. The Philippines, which recorded the first fatality from the epidemic outside of China, imposed the travel ban on travellers from Taiwan on Monday. Taiwan appealed for its lifting. Panelo said an inter-agency panel will evaluate other jurisdictions, including the Chinese territory of Macau, for release from the ban as well, Panelo said.

12 Feb 2020 11:27AM,New coronavirus cases lowest since Jan but experts disagree over peak,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: China reported on Wednesday (Feb 12) its lowest number of new coronavirus cases since January, lending weight to a prediction by its senior medical adviser that the outbreak could end by April. International experts, however, remain alarmed by the spread of the flu-like virus which has now killed more than 1,100 people, all but two in mainland China. China's foremost medical adviser on the outbreak, Zhong Nanshan, said on Tuesday numbers of new cases were falling in some provinces and forecast the epidemic would peak this month. ""I hope this outbreak or this event may be over in something like April,"" Zhong, an epidemiologist whose previous forecast of an earlier peak turned out to be premature, told Reuters.  Total infections in China have hit 44,653, say health officials, including 2,015 new confirmed cases on Tuesday. That was the lowest daily rise in new cases since Jan. 30. The number of deaths on the mainland rose by 97 to 1,113 by the end of Tuesday. But doubts have been aired on social media about how reliable the figures are, after the government last week amended guidelines on the classification of cases. While Chinese officials said the situation was under control, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the epidemic posed a global threat potentially worse than terrorism. The world must ""wake up and consider this enemy virus as public enemy number one,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters on Tuesday, adding the first vaccine was 18 months away. Asked about Zhong's prediction, Australia's chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said: ""I think it's far too premature to say that."" ""I think we've just got to watch the data very closely over the coming weeks before we make any predictions,"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corp on Wednesday, while praising China's ""Herculean efforts"" to contain the virus.   Hundreds of cases have been reported in dozens of countries and territories around the world, including one fatality in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines. The biggest cluster of cases outside of China was aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined off the Japanese port of Yokohama with about 3,700 people on board. Japanese officials on Wednesday said another 39 people had tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the total to 175. One of the new cases was a quarantine officer. Thailand said it was barring passengers from another cruise ship, MS Westerdam, from disembarking, the latest country to turn it away amid fears of the coronavirus, despite no confirmed infections on board. ""BATTLE THAT MUST BE WON"" Echoing the WHO's comparison with the fight against terrorism, China's state news agency Xinhua said in an article published late on Tuesday the epidemic was a ""battle that has no gunpowder smoke but must be won"". It warned the epidemic was a ""big test of China's governance system and capabilities"" and said some officials were still ""dropping the ball"" in places where it was most severe. ""This is a wake-up call for us,"" it said. Hubei's government dismissed the provincial health commission's Communist Party boss, state media said on Tuesday, amid mounting public anger over local authorities' handling of the crisis. China's censors had allowed criticism of local officials but have begun cracking down on reporting of the outbreak, issuing reprimands to tech firms that gave free rein to online speech, according to Chinese journalists. DEALS ON HOLD The pathogen has been officially named COVID-19 - CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for the year it emerged. The virus emerged from an illegal wildlife market in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan in December. The city of 11 million people remains under virtual lockdown and other Chinese cities resemble ghost towns due to travel restrictions which have paralysed the world's second-biggest economy. World stocks, which had seen rounds of sell-offs over the coronarvirus' impact on China's economy and its ripple effects, surged to record highs on Zhong's comments. The Dow industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all hit new peaks. Asian shares and Wall Street futures nudged higher on Wednesday amid hopes the worst of the coronavirus in China may have passed. Even if the epidemic ends soon, it has already taken a toll on China's economy, as companies began laying off workers and other firms said they would need loans running into billions of dollars to stay afloat. Supply chains for car manufacturers to smartphone makers have broken down.   Bankers in Asia are bracing for a deal drought as key meetings and roadshows are put on hold. ""All our deals are on hold now - capital markets or M&A. Nothing is happening,"" said a Hong Kong-based senior investment banker with a Wall Street bank. White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien said the coronavirus outbreak could reduce Chinese purchases of American agricultural products this year under the US-China Phase 1 trade deal. ANZ Bank said China’s first-quarter growth would probably slow to 3.2 per cent to 4 per cent, down from a projection of 5 per cent. China will stagger the re-opening of schools to stave off virus risks, a government official said.

12 Feb 2020 04:35PM,"Chess, squabbles aboard cruise ship cast away by coronavirus fears","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners HANOI: Angela Jones is on a cruise to nowhere. For nearly two weeks, the business consultant from the US state of Georgia has been at sea on board the MS Westerdam, a ship of healthy passengers which has been turned away by Japan, Taiwan, Guam and the Philippines over fears that someone on the cruise may have the coronavirus. The latest country to shun the ship, which has 1,455 passengers and 802 crew on board, is Thailand, where the health minister has publicly refused to grant the Westerdam permission to dock.  ""We try to stay hopeful, because that's all we've got: To be hopeful. But each day, that becomes a little bit more difficult when country after country rejects us,"" Jones told Reuters in a video recording. Like many on board, Jones had embarked in Hong Kong for a much-anticipated cruise through the region in early February. It was scheduled to be a two-week cruise, but with that period running out this week, there are worries about fuel and food supplies. Many on board are elderly and could be running out of medicines. ""We are hoping that just any country will see us as ... many human beings from many countries around the world that literally are at your mercy to let us go home,"" said Jones. To kill time on board and break up the monotony of endless ocean scrolling past cabin windows, the ship's crew have organised dozens of activities to keep people occupied, tourists on board the vessel told Reuters.   People could be seen playing chess and doing puzzles on Wednesday, in some of the first pictures published by media of life aboard the ship as passengers pass the time awaiting news of how and when they might get home. Other activities on offer include colouring-in for adults; teeth whitening; poker tournaments; whisky tasting; even a lecture on modern China which delved into the economics of collective farming, according to passengers on board and a copy of the ship's activity programme seen by Reuters. ""The staff has tried to bolster spirits but you can only play so many games of trivia,"" said Jones. ""I've asked others who say they are napping a lot"". BANGKOK DOCK BLOCK Passengers on board the ship have been subjected to regular health checks, according to ship operator Holland America, a unit of Miami-based Carnival Corp. There have been no reported cases of the coronavirus on board. Stoking fears is the ongoing quarantine in Japan of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, also managed by a unit of Carnival Corp. A total of 175 out of the 3,700 people on board the Diamond Princess have tested positive for the coronavirus. ""We are isolated, we have been isolated for two weeks and so we would probably be the best bet as far as no (infections),"" Jones said.   Still, that does not appear to have been enough to convince Thai officials to allow the ship to dock in Bangkok, although the World Health Organization and the Southeast Asian country's deputy transport minister has indicated that Thai health authorities could board the ship to conduct health checks and replenish the vessel with supplies. By noon on Wednesday, the Westerdam was 280km from the Thai coast and on a heading for Bangkok, according to data published by the Maritime Traffic ship tracking website. It was still not clear if the ship would be allowed to dock there. Later on Wednesday, the Thai Navy ""Bhumibol Adulyadej"" warship could be seen escorting the Westerdam in waters just off the Thai coast, according to passengers and Marine Traffic. #Westerdam cruise ship @HALcruises said it's working on fact it'll not be able to dock in #Thailand #LaemChabang. It initially said it was going to dock Feb 13. But I understand many onboard remain clueless as to final outcome. At least 1 onboard told me captain not sharing much pic.twitter.com/AOCIarUSpH  20-year-old Maria Angus, a fashion student from New Zealand travelling on the cruise with her parents, said the ship's captain notified passengers on Wednesday morning that they were seeking help from other countries. ""The highest level of several governments including the United States, Canada, Britain and the Netherlands are closely following the Westerdam's situation and these governments are interacting with Thai authorities and the World Health Organization to ensure all of our needs are met,"" said Angus, citing the ship's captain, Vincent Smit. The US Embassy in Bangkok said they were closely monitoring the situation. ""The State Department is working with the ship's operator and governments in the region who might be able to assist,"" spokeswoman Jillian Bonnardeaux told Reuters. Despite Bangkok's reluctance to grant docking permission, crew members staged a farewell ceremony for passengers on Wednesday morning, singing to the tune of the 1979 hit ""We Are Family"" by Sister Sledge. Elsewhere on board, the patience of some passengers was beginning to be tested, Jones said, as some people pushed and shoved for access to one of the ship's only available computers and printers, to re-book flights home. ""Hard to imagine these senior cruisers coming to blows but guess that happened,"" said Jones. ""It's funny and sad at the same time"".

Just hours later, China reported that the number of confirmed cases had risen to 830, with 25 dead. The National Health Commission said authorities were also examining 1,072 suspected cases of the virus that first emerged in central city of Wuhan. Non-fatal cases have been found in at least seven other countries. Health officials fear the transmission rate could accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel at home and abroad during week-long holidays for Chinese New Year, which begins on Saturday. Nonetheless, it was a ""bit too early"" to consider the outbreak a ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern,"" WHO Emergency Committee panel chair Didier Houssin said after the body met in Geneva. Such a designation would have required countries to step up the international response. ""Make no mistake, though, this is an emergency in China,"" said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. ""It has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one,"" he said. Scrambling to contain the outbreak, the local government in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in Hubei province, suspended most transport on Thursday, including outgoing flights, and people were told not to leave. Hours later, neighboring Huanggang, a city of about 7 million people, announced similar measures. By Friday, 10 cities near Wuhan had halted public transport, effectively placing a quarantine on 20 million people. ""The lockdown of 11 million people is unprecedented in public health history,"" said Gauden Galea, the WHO's representative in Beijing.   The organisation said, however, that it was not yet recommending any broader restrictions on travel or trade.  The previously unknown virus strain is believed to have emerged late last year from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in Wuhan. It has created alarm because there are a number of unknowns surrounding it. It is too early to know just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. There is no vaccine for the virus, which can spread through respiratory transmission. Symptoms include fever, difficulty breathing and coughing.  Michael Ryan, head of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, said data from China suggested almost three-quarters of the cases were in people aged over 40, with some 40% having underlying health conditions. ""At the moment, we haven't seen many mild cases,"" he said, cautioning that it was difficult at the start of an epidemic to estimate the severity or true fatality rate. There had been human-to-human transmission of the virus in China, limited to family groups and health workers, said Tedros. Three research teams working on a vaccine, a global coalition set up to fight diseases said. It is aiming to have a shot developed and approved within a year. The committee of 16 independent experts had been divided in its conclusion not to declare a global emergency, said Tedros, adding that the decision ""should not be taken as a sign that the WHO does not think the situation is serious."" Peter Piot, a professor of global health and director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the outbreak was at a critical phase. ""Regardless of the decision not to declare this a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, intensified international collaboration and more resources will be crucial to stopping this outbreak in its tracks,"" he said. ""There cannot be any complacency as to the need for global action."" The biggest tumble in Chinese stocks in more than eight months led global equity markets lower on Thursday as concern mounted about the outbreak. TRAVEL WARNINGS In Wuhan, the Hankou railway station was nearly deserted on Thursday, state broadcasts showed. State media reported highway toll booths around Wuhan were closing, effectively cutting off road exits, and all ride-hailing services would be cancelled from Friday. Guards were patrolling highways, one resident said.   As the city slipped into isolation, residents thronged hospitals for medical checks and rushed to buy supplies, clearing out supermarket shelves and queuing for petrol. Other cities were also taking steps to contain the virus. Nearby Ezhou shut train stations. Beijing cancelled large gatherings, including two Lunar New Year temple fairs, and closed the Forbidden City, the capital's most famous tourist attraction, to visitors until further notice. The US State Department warned travellers to exercise increased caution in China as airports worldwide stepped up the screening of passengers arriving from the country. Cases have already been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States. Five people were being tested in Scotland for the virus as a precaution, the BBC reported on Thursday. All had respiratory symptoms and had recently been in Wuhan, it said. Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, which has two confirmed cases, is turning two holiday camps into quarantine stations as a precaution. Taiwan has banned anyone from Wuhan from going to the island. Chinese people had their own ways of protecting themselves. ""I go straight to where I need to go, and then I go home,"" said 79-year-old Li Meihua, from behind a mask, on the streets of Shanghai.

04 Feb 2020 09:09AM,"Japan testing 3,700 people quarantined on cruise ship after Hong Kong novel coronavirus case","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TOKYO: Japanese officials began screening more than 3,700 passengers and crew on a cruise ship quarantined off the port of Yokohama near Tokyo on Tuesday (Feb 4) after a Hong Kong man who sailed on the vessel last month tested positive for coronavirus. The 80-year-old man flew to Japan and boarded the ship, the Diamond Princess, run by Carnival Japan Inc, in Yokohama on Jan 20 and disembarked in Hong Kong on Jan 25, the company said. Japan was also preparing to expand the scope of its screening for the virus, and test criteria after initial tests failed to detect the virus in some people who were later found to be infected, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told reporters. Opposition parties and some experts have criticised the government for responding too slowly to the risks posed by the virus spreading in China and elsewhere. Chinese make up 30 per cent of all tourists travelling to Japan and nearly 40 per cent of the total amount foreign visitors spent last year, according to an industry survey. Japan has 20 confirmed coronavirus cases, of these 17 people have been in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the epidemic began. Japan on Saturday began refusing entry to foreigners who have been in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, in the past 14 days as well as people with passports issued in Hubei province. Suga said that as of Feb 3, eight foreigners had been barred from entering Japan. Some countries including the United States and Australia have denied entry to all foreign nationals travelling from China. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said he believed Japan's current restrictions on entry were appropriate, when asked at a news conference. Carnival Japan, a unit of British-American cruise operator Carnival Corp, confirmed that the turnaround of the ship had been delayed by about 24 hours for authorities to review the health of all 2,666 guests and 1,045 crew on board. Once everyone's health was checked, those with fevers or who felt unwell would be tested, after which authorities would decide whether to let people leave the ship, Suga said. Asked if the epidemic would affect a visit by Chinese leader Xi Jinping expected to take place in April, Suga said preparations for the visit were proceeding as planned.

14 Feb 2020 07:47AM,Non-ICT IPPT for NSmen suspended amid coronavirus outbreak,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) has suspended the individual physical proficiency test (IPPT) for operationally ready national servicemen (NSmen) until end-February due to the novel coronavirus outbreak. However, the conduct of IPPT will still continue at the unit level for NSmen attending in-camp training (ICT), it said in a Facebook post on Thursday evening (Feb 13). MINDEF said it will temporarily close the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) fitness conditioning centres, and suspend IPPT, IPPT preparatory training (IPT) and remedial training at the centres as well as at SAFRA gyms and IPT-in-the-Park locations until the end of the month. “This is to minimise the close congregation of large numbers of NSmen at these locations solely for the conduct of physical activities, as the facilities can get very crowded during these sessions,” it said. NSmen who have scheduled these activities in February at the affected locations will receive an SMS informing them about the cancellation, the ministry added. This comes after Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange. The country currently has 58 confirmed cases of the virus. Under the new DORSCON level, organisers of large events should take necessary precautions such as carrying out temperature screening, looking out for respiratory symptoms like cough or runny nose, and denying entry to unwell individuals. Senior Minister of State for Defence Heng Chee How said on Tuesday there were no plans to cancel ICT due to COVID-19, and the SAF has taken the necessary precautionary measures at its camps. “MINDEF will continue to review and implement additional measures and adjust its policies to safeguard the well-being of national servicemen, according to the developments of the virus situation in Singapore,” the ministry said. MINDEF said NSmen with IPPT birthday windows ending in February should reach out to their unit for assistance. “For further IPPT- and IPT-related queries, please call the 24-hour NS Hotline at 1800 367 6767 or email contact@ns.sg for assistance,” it added.

06 Feb 2020 06:50AM,China coronavirus death toll rises to 563,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The number of confirmed fatalities from China's coronavirus outbreak rose to at least 563, after authorities in hardest-hit Hubei province reported 73 new deaths on Thursday (Feb 6). In its daily update, the health commission in Hubei also confirmed another 3,694 new cases.   The commission also confirmed the number of infections has reached 28,018 nationwide. The epidemic, which has spiralled into a global health emergency, is believed to have emerged in December from a market that sold wild game in Hubei's capital Wuhan. Hu Lishan, an official in Wuhan, warned Wednesday that despite building a hospital from scratch and converting public buildings to accommodate thousands of extra patients, there was still a ""severe"" lack of beds in the region.  There was also a shortage of ""equipment and materials,"" he told reporters, adding that officials were looking to convert other hotels and schools in the city into treatment centres. Authorities in several other cities in China have placed restrictions on the number of people allowed to leave their homes. Global concerns have also risen about the virus, with cases confirmed in more than 20 countries.

03 Feb 2020 03:22PM,"Shut out of WHO, Taiwan faces flight bans, update delays in novel coronavirus crisis","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TAIPEI: Shut out of the World Health Organization, Taiwan is facing a dual problem in tackling the threat of a new coronavirus: It is being included as a high-risk area as part of China but is unable to get epidemic information firsthand. Taiwan is denied membership of most international organisations including the WHO, a UN agency, due to the objections of China, which considers it a Chinese province with no right to participate unless it accepts it is part of China, something Taiwan's government will not do. Taiwan has long complained about China's belittling of it on the international stage and its forcing of foreign governments and companies to refer to it as part of China. Now, with the virus biting, Taiwan says this policy means it has become collateral damage, as despite having only 10 cases compared with more than 17,000 in China, where the virus emerged in December, the WHO is lumping Taiwan's cases together with China's.   The consequences of that became evident on the weekend when the government said Taiwan's largest airline, China Airlines, had been included in an Italian ban on flights from China because the WHO lists Taiwan under China as part of a high-risk virus area. Bob Chen, the head of the Taiwan foreign ministry's Department of International Organisations, said they had complained repeatedly to the WHO to stop listing Taiwan as part of China. ""But to date, the WHO's secretariat's attitude has been very hard-line. It's very obvious that under China's pressure they can't show flexibility,"" he said on Sunday (Feb 2). However, the WHO, while still listing Taiwan as part of China, is now referring to it as ""Taipei"", rather than ""Taiwan, China"" as it did in its initial situation reports, Chen said. ""It's a small change, but from our perspective it's still far from enough. The biggest problem is they are still putting us under China."" In a rare diplomatic success for Taiwan, it managed on Saturday to get Vietnam to lift its ban on flights to the island, which it had also initially listed under China.   China Airlines says its Rome flights remain suspended as Taiwan pressed Italy for them to be resumed. Taiwan's other main airline, Eva Airways, is due to start flights to Milan this month. It said it had no information on whether they would go ahead. Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said the island's diplomats around the world were working to ensure more countries do not stop flights from Taiwan. The WHO's office in Beijing and Italy's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ""LIMITED"" INFORMATION China has denied seeking to make life difficult for Taiwan during this outbreak, with the government saying it has ensured Taiwan is kept informed and ""nobody cares more"" about Taiwan's people than Beijing's government. Wang Liang-yu, Taiwan's de facto ambassador in Geneva where the WHO is based, told Reuters the procedures needed to be changed as existing WHO channels provided only ""limited"" information. ""The WHO should not hint that bilateral channels are enough to replace international cooperation,"" she said.   The WHO says it is collaborating closely with Taiwan authorities through International Health Regulations (IHR) mechanisms in response to the outbreak, referring to a 2005 legal instrument governing health reporting requirements. ""WHO works with Taiwanese health officials, following established procedures, to facilitate fast and effective response, including through the IHR,"" said spokesman Tarik Jasarevic, adding that Taiwan officials had been invited to attend WHO technical meetings last year. Taiwan Centres for Disease Control deputy head Chuang Jen-hsiang said the island can get coronavirus information but it has to wait for information to appear on WHO websites, meaning they don't immediately get access to it. ""There is a time gap, but we can see it,"" he said.

02 Feb 2020 06:06AM,"Commentary: As a parent, I worry about my kids and the Wuhan coronavirus situation. So I’m taking action","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners News of the Wuhan coronavirus have created anxiety and fear among parents. June Yong admits she shares some of these sentiments but shares her experience on what’s getting her through. SINGAPORE: Over the past week or so, the spotlight shifted very quickly from Chinese New Year festivities to the deadly coronavirus. As a parent with three kids in primary school, I couldn’t help but feel on the edge as the day to return to school post-CNY drew near. News about the compulsory leave of absence (LOA) for teachers and students returning from China helped settle the jitters somewhat but did not remove it completely. I was also in a dilemma. As my second child was still recovering from a flu bug, I wasn’t entirely sure whether he was well enough to return to school. In the end, I kept all three at home on the first day. To be absolutely honest, I’m not sure if it was more responsible parenting or paranoia driving that decision. Apparently I wasn’t the only one who was gripped by fear, as a few of my daughter’s classmates were absent on that day too. But when she begged to go to school the next day, I relented. What kind of message would I be sending my kids if I allowed fear to steer my every course? FEAR IN THE DRIVER’S SEAT In the movie Inside Out, we get an insider perspective of what goes on in the emotional world of Riley, the main character of the show. It was fascinating to watch how each of her five basic emotions — Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger — took control at the console of her mind. In today’s virus-warped world, it is apparent that Fear is in the driver’s seat. This is the primary emotion that is causing people to grab and hoard masks, despite the government’s call to use them responsibly and only when feeling unwell. It is the emotion driving restaurant owners in Korea to put up signs saying “no Chinese allowed”. It is also the emotion that is causing us to think twice about sending our children to school. Now it is perfectly normal to be fearful, given that there are a lot of unknowns about this virus: When it is contagious — upon infection or post-symptom, how it is transmitted, who are most at risk, and how long it will take to die down. The accelerating pace of the virus spread in China and around the world is also making it hard to get a handle on the situation. As parents, we worry that the situation will turn south very quickly, and we don’t want to see our offspring suffering needlessly. So we pull out all the stops to ensure their safety, whether it is by keeping them home, driving them to and from school, skipping unnecessary events, or getting them masks. More than a week back, many of us also called on the Government to take action and prevent Hubei nationals and travellers from entering Singapore when the situation took a turn for the worse, a move that was eventually made. But the question remains: How much is safe enough? And for a parent, is school okay but not tuition and enrichment activities? How long can we maintain this state of hyper-vigilance? Last Thursday, I brought my boys for their usual badminton lessons and we practically had the entire hall to ourselves. We all hope that the virus will disappear in weeks, and that it will neither run the months-long course as SARS nor come anywhere close to the impact it had. But one thing seems certain: We have not seen the peak yet, and the number of infected cases around the world is going to rise. Elsewhere including the US, community spread has already occurred. Experts are saying the virus may continue for the next few months given how fast it’s been spreading. KEEPING ANXIETY IN CHECK My WhatsApp chat groups have been buzzing with information shared by parents on how to protect ourselves and where to get masks, sanitisers and anti-bacterial wipes. While mostly useful, it also induces anxiety. The past week, I’ve noticed moments when I felt harried and breathless, and I think it could be my body’s stress response. In the first few days of the newsbreak, I also found myself using negative terms such as “your immunity will be weak” or “the virus will make you very sick” in a bid to scare them into washing their hands properly before meals. I’ve since tried to be more measured in my word choices, so as not to create greater anxiety in my kids, using a more positive tone such as “let’s keep ourselves healthy during this period”. It may seem small in the scheme of things but this is the time to exercise leadership and role-modelling as parents. Part of this is to avoid stressing our kids out unduly. LEARNING FROM THE JAPANESE When a perceived threat is imminent and unknown, we will all experience a period of heightened fear and irrational behaviour. Because of the scarcity of masks or other health-related goods, people start to eye one another suspiciously. Every sneeze or slight clearing of throat is enough to get you stares on public transport. Caution is certainly needed but we may need time to adjust and allow other healthier emotions to take their rightful place at the wheel, perhaps those of perseverance, hope and level-headedness. In this regard, we could learn from the Japanese. Japan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. Children there are taught earthquake survival skills early on in their lives. Schools run regular earthquake drills, educating kids on the best way to stay safe during an earthquake. One common strategy taught is for children to get under their desks and hold onto their table legs until the trembling is over. If playing outside, children are taught to go to the centre of an open space to avoid falling objects. Since we will need time to bring the virus to heel, we should instill good hygiene habits in our young. From washing hands properly, to practising good cough etiquette by covering your mouth or using a mask, and handling and disposing masks carefully — if we train them up well in these areas, as a society we will enjoy stronger defences against the coronavirus and future viruses as well.   Along with staying home if one is ill instead of heading out, these are good habits we should instill in our children irrespective of news of this pandemic. A PARENT’S WISH LIST When I picked the kids up after school last week, I asked if their teachers had encouraged them to wash their hands, or given them more water breaks to hydrate their bodies. I was a tad disappointed to hear that there were no such exhortations. Granted, even if the teachers instruct, kids being kids, some may not take these seriously and just do a cursory wash. So parents cannot abdicate our responsibility in drilling our kids. Given the potential danger a community spread in schools could cause, I think more can be done in the area of educating our children on hygiene and viral protection. Experts have emphasised that this battle will not be won on the back of masks or sanitisers, but one’s level of personal hygiene. Dr Leong Hoe Nam, Infectious Disease Specialist humorously shared his golden rule in a radio interview: “Don’t touch your face. Your face is sacred.” I told this to my children and they laughed; I certainly hope it makes the message stick. I think schools have done well thus far in keeping parents abreast of the latest protective measures. Apart from daily temperature taking and implementing the LOA, they can also consider using curriculum time set aside for Health Education or PAL (Programme for Active Learning) to inculcate healthy hygiene habits. After all, real-life experiences, even crises, are often where textbook lessons can be brought to life THE CHOICES WE EXERCISE We do not know how this pandemic will pan out, but we can control our thoughts and choices today. By all means, take the necessary precautions but in order to emerge unscathed through this crisis, we need to balance fear with equal doses of calm, wit and trust. By practising good hygiene habits as a family, we can go about our daily lives like the Japanese children, with hope and optimism while constantly vigilant for the next alarm. If we manage ourselves well, this crisis could turn out to be an opportunity for us and our children to learn a kind of resilience that could shelter Singapore for years to come — no matter what virus mutations come our way.

04 Feb 2020 06:00PM,4 locally transmitted cases among new coronavirus patients in Singapore,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore confirmed on Tuesday (Feb 4) its first locally transmitted cases of the novel coronavirus, among six new cases of the disease detected in the country. Four Singapore residents with no recent travel history to China have tested positive for the virus, which has sickened more than 20,000 and killed more than 420 people since it was detected in Wuhan in central China. One of them was a tour guide for a group of Chinese tourists, two work at a shop the group had visited, while a fourth case of local transmission was the domestic helper of one of the cases, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said at a briefing. The tour group had arrived in Singapore from China on Jan 22 and went to Malaysia from Jan 24 to 26. They re-entered Singapore via Woodlands Checkpoint at 3am on Jan 27 and flew from Changi Airport Terminal 1 at 6am. Pending confirmation from the Chinese authorities, the travellers are from Guangxi, and at least two of them have since been confirmed to have the coronavirus, said MOH. ""The Ministry of Health has commenced contact tracing to identify individuals who had close contact with these cases, so as to ring-fence the cluster and limit further spread,"" said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong.   Another two new cases announced by the authorities on Tuesday are Singapore residents who had been evacuated from Wuhan. This brings the total number of cases in Singapore to 24.   Two of the patients who caught the virus here are salespeople at Yong Thai Hang, a health product store that serves primarily Chinese tourists. They are the 19th and 20th cases reported. The tour group had visited the store, among other places, on Jan 23.   The 19th case, a 28-year-old Singapore permanent resident, reported developing a sore throat and fever on Jan 29. She went to Tan Tock Seng Hospital emergency department on Jan 30 and was discharged after a chest X-ray found she did not have pneumonia. She stayed at home from Jan 31 till Sunday before being admitted to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) on Monday.  The 20th case is a 48-year-old Singaporean woman who lives at Hougang Street 61. She reported symptoms on Jan 25 and was admitted on Monday to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). Information about her movements between Jan 25 and Monday was not provided. Case 19's maid, a 44-year-old Indonesian national, is the 21st case. She reported onset of symptoms on Sunday and did not leave her house until she was admitted to SGH the next day. A tour guide who brought tour groups to Yong Thai Hang is the 24th case. The 32-year-old Singaporean was asymptomatic when she went to NCID.   The 22nd and 23rd cases, both Singaporeans, were among 92 people evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30 and the two had no symptoms when they boarded the flight to Singapore. They were put under quarantine in Singapore and tested positive on Monday despite showing no symptoms. They are now both in isolation rooms at NCID. Authorities on Tuesday said that the four cases of local transmission are not evidence of community spread as they can be traced back to recent travellers from China and some had close contact with one another. Mr Gan elaborated on the difference between a local transmission cluster and community spread: “The main difference is that for this cluster, we could identify all the sources that were involved. The source was a group of mainland China tourists. We have their names, we have an indication of the patients that fell ill. “Therefore we could identify the specific source… If we are able to ringfence this particular cluster, we can control the spread. Therefore we say it is a limited local transmission.” But if there are multiple clusters and the Government cannot determine the source, that is when it would be labelled a widespread community transmission, he added. “When that happens, we will move to Dorscon (Dors condition) Orange. Today, we are still at Yellow.”  Currently, Singapore is at Dorscon Yellow, signifying that the virus is severe and can infect from person to person, but is chiefly occurring outside Singapore. The next step up is Dorscon Orange, whereby the virus is spreading in Singapore but not widely, and is being contained. At the heart of Singapore’s response plan is the Disease Outbreak Response System (Dors), a crisis management plan which did not exist in 2003, but was drafted after SARS and refined again in the wake of the swine flu (H1N1) pandemic in 2009. MOH's director of medical services Kenneth Mak added that even though the domestic helper of one of the cases was infected, it was in an ""enclosed setting"" within the home. ""We're still continuing to do contact tracing and we'll continue to be vigilant for more cases. There may be more cases that come out in relation to the same exposure to ... this travel group,"" he added.  Answering queries from reporters, Mr Gan said that the mode of transmission between the tour group and the patients cannot be determined, but the tour guide would have been with the tour group for a long period of time while the salespeople would have interacted with the travellers at the shop. ""It's not transient contact ... where you happen to meet (the person) on the street,"" he said. Dr Mak said that the tour guide reported that some of the travellers were coughing and sneezing while they were in Singapore but it would be ""speculative"" to say that this was the mode of transmission. As the tour group has returned to China, some of the contacts are a result of checking with the Chinese authorities, Mr Gan added.  ADDITIONAL PRECAUTIONS, CONTACT TRACING As an added precaution, individuals who, like the cases of local transmission, have had recent close contact with people with travel history to mainland China will be contacted. Authorities are also tracking the contacts of a Malaysian who had tested positive for the novel coronavirus after attending a meeting at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Singapore that involved Chinese nationals. In addition, MOH has expanded surveillance efforts to conduct 2019-nCoV testing on all individuals with pneumonia at Singapore hospitals since last week. Other measures to pre-empt possible community spread of the virus were also announced, including enhanced cleaning of public areas.  Authorities have urged places with high human traffic to step up cleaning, including food and beverage outlets, shops and hotels. ""Current evidence suggests that the likely modes of transmission are mainly through contact with droplets from infected individuals, either directly or indirectly through hands that have come into contact with these droplets,"" said MOH. ""The virus can also transmit through surface contact."" Sanitation and hygiene advisories have been disseminated by the National Environment Agency. ""I URGE SINGAPOREANS TO REMAIN CALM"" A more cautious stance will be taken with vulnerable groups like young children and the elderly, authorities said. Schools will not hold mass assemblies and recess sessions will be staggered, while school camps will be cancelled. Pre-schools facilities will suspend large-group and communal activities, while eldercare facilities will also suspend external excursions and large gatherings. Should community spread occur, more measures to reduce human interaction will be considered, authorities added. ""We are closely monitoring the situation and stand ready to ramp up our measures if necessary,"" said Mr Gan. ""I urge Singaporeans to remain calm. We will spare no effort to protect our people."" ONE MAN DISCHARGED The 18 earlier confirmed cases in Singapore all had recent travel history to Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. In an update, MOH said one of the cases was discharged on Tuesday after testing negative for the virus. The patient discharged, a 35-year-old man from Wuhan who, was the seventh case detected in Singapore.  Many of the remaining cases are improving and at least two are asymptomatic; several need oxygen support but none are critically ill. Chief Health Scientist Tan Chorh Chuan said that many of the patients are on supportive treatment while a small number are on an antiretroviral combination of Lopinavir and Ritonavir. As of noon on Tuesday, 289 suspect cases have tested negative for 2019 novel coronavirus and test results for 20 cases are pending. As a precaution, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. All other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be contacted daily to monitor the status of their health. MOH has also identified 311 close contacts. Of the 239 who are still in Singapore, 234 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. The ministry is trying to contact the remaining five.  On Saturday, Singapore widened travel restrictions to bar all new visitors with recent travel history to mainland China from Singapore. These visitors are also not allowed to transit in Singapore. The coronavirus has killed more than 400 people and infected more than 20,000 around the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the virus outbreak a global emergency. Hong Kong on Monday reported the city's first fatality from the coronavirus, and the second outside mainland China.

05 Feb 2020 12:45AM,Four-year-old coronavirus patient in Malaysia discharged from hospital,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners KUALA LUMPUR: A girl in Malaysia has recovered from the novel coronavirus infection and will be allowed to return home to China, a Malaysian health official said in a statement late on Tuesday (Feb 4). The four-year-old is the first in the country to have recovered after becoming infected with the coronavirus. There are currently 10 confirmed cases in Malaysia. Malaysia Health Ministry's director general Noor Hisham Abdullah said detection tests were repeated twice and the results came back negative. ""She is now is good health and has been allowed to return home,"" he said. The girl and her family will return to China with a health certificate issued by the hospital, chief of press at the Chinese embassy Tang Tang told reporters by text message. The child was diagnosed last week and treated in an isolation ward at a hospital in Langkawi, a popular island holiday destination.  Malaysia on Tuesday confirmed the country's first citizen case of the novel coronavirus. Malaysian Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad said the man from Selangor is in stable condition and receiving treatment at Sungai Buloh Hospital. Singapore’s Ministry of Health (MOH) on Tuesday said the Malaysian national was in Singapore from Jan 16 to Jan 23 for a business meeting at the Grand Hyatt Hotel that involved Chinese nationals. After his return to Malaysia, the 42-year-old man developed symptoms and was subsequently tested positive for the novel coronavirus on Feb 3. Singapore's health ministry said it has initiated epidemiological investigations and contact tracing to identify the individuals who had close contact with the cases. The man started showing symptoms on Jan 29, nearly a week after he returned to Malaysia, according to Malaysian authorities. The man's immediate family will also be put under ""home surveillance"" for 14 days, Dr Dzulkefly added.

12 Feb 2020 04:09PM,Discrimination of healthcare workers due to coronavirus ‘disgraceful’: Amrin Amin,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The discrimination of some healthcare workers due to suspicions of close contact with coronavirus cases is ""disgraceful"", Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Home Affairs Amrin Amin has said. “There's one issue that I would like to comment on, which is on discrimination faced by our healthcare officers,” he told reporters on Wednesday (Feb 12). “We have read reports of nurses being asked not to take the lift, take the stairs instead. Nurses have been asked to leave the train ... Ambulance drivers being asked not to buy food, so as not to contaminate others,"" said Mr Amrin. “These are very unfortunate incidents, and it's very disgraceful.” Mr Amrin’s comments came after several reports of healthcare workers being ostracised in public due to concerns over the new virus. “It does not reflect the best of us Singaporeans,” he continued. “In times or crisis, we must stand together and stand united, and these are people, ordinary men and women who have served Singapore in this time. “Some of them have volunteered their services, come in and stepped up. I think they deserve our support and encouragement. “I urge all Singaporeans to encourage them and to recognise their contributions in this moment.”   Mr Amrin urged Singaporeans to “condemn the disgraceful acts” by a minority, and make it clear that these acts do not represent Singaporeans. “We are better than that,” he added. “And we will show Singapore and the world who we really are.” Mr Amrin said the public should not be alarmed as all emergency medical crew will wear personal protective equipment when responding to all calls, not just suspected coronavirus cases. “The ambulance, after conveying a suspect case, will be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, so the public should rest assured,” he stated. Mr Amrin was speaking at the Singapore Civil Defence Force headquarters where he met frontline officers who had attended suspected coronavirus cases. “I'm here to say thank you to the men and women who have bravely served Singapore in this moment of need,” he said. “They have stepped up. Many of them have said they are also anxious, but despite that they continue to perform duties required of them and I think they deserve to be honoured.""

11 Feb 2020 12:15PM,Thailand refuses entry to cruise ship amid coronavirus concerns,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BANGKOK: Thailand has barred passengers from Holland America's cruise ship MS Westerdam from disembarking, its health minister said on Tuesday (Feb 11), the latest country to turn it away amid fears of the coronavirus despite no confirmed infections on board. The Netherlands-flagged ship was sailing in a westerly direction, 96km (60 miles) off the southern coast of Vietnam on Tuesday morning, according to data from the Marine Traffic ship tracking website. Holland America, owned by Miami-based Carnival Corp, had said on Monday that passengers would disembark in Bangkok on Feb 13 and that there was no reason to believe anybody on board had the virus. ""I have issued orders. Permission to dock refused,"" Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said in a Facebook post. Deputy Transport Minister Atirat Ratanasate said in a separate Facebook post that, while the ship would not be allowed to dock, Thailand ""will gladly help providing fuel, medicine, and food"" to the ship. #Thailand govt says the #Westerdam ship with more than 2,000 people on board is off the coast of #Vietnam. Ship will sail about 31 hours more before reaching #Thai waters by tomorrow night. The marine department is tracking its movement hourly. 21 Thais believed to be on board pic.twitter.com/2SpGNqvcDw  The coronavirus that emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last month has caused chaos in Asia and beyond with many flights suspended, businesses disrupted and entry restrictions imposed by governments trying to ward off the spread. It has also roiled the world of luxury cruises. Another cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, with 3,700 passengers and crew onboard, is quarantined in the Japanese port of Yokohama, with 135 cases of coronavirus detected on the Carnival Corp-owned vessel. The World Dream cruise ship was held up in Hong Kong for days after it was linked to three cases but all passengers and crew later tested negative and were allowed to disembark. The virus has killed more than 1,000 people - all but two in China - and infected more than 40,000, most in China but including 319 cases in 24 other countries and territories. Thailand recorded one new case of coronavirus on Tuesday, bringing the total in the country to 33 since January. The Westerdam had already been turned away from several countries, including Japan and the Philippines, amid fears of the virus. VOYAGE TO NOWHERE Holland America says no one on board has the virus. Media reports say it carries 1,455 passengers and 802 crew; its original destination was Yokohama, Japan, which refused it permission to dock. ""The ship is not in quarantine and we have no reason to believe there are any cases of coronavirus on board despite media reports,"" the company said. It had earlier said the Westerdam was sailing toward Bangkok, and it is not immediately clear whether the ship would change course. Holland America said it was aware of reports that Thailand planned to refuse permission for the Westerdam to dock there and was ""actively working"" on the matter. ""We know this is confusing for our guests and their families and we greatly appreciate their patience,"" the company said in a statement. The 285m long Westerdam can carry up to 1,964 passengers, according to the Holland America website, and is packed with cafes, restaurants and a Blues club. The ship had already introduced extra health screening measures, including temperature checks and cleaning to defend against the virus, Holland America said in a statement. Some passengers on board the ship said they had not been told that the ship would be unable to dock in Thailand. ""(We) thought is was all finalised. Everyone has rebooked flights yet again! Now we are back in limbo,"" passenger Stephen Hansen told Reuters by email. American tourist Angela Jones said passengers had been getting regular temperature checks but were becoming frustrated with the uncertainty of the situation. ""I wish someone would allow us to dock and wait it out to prove no coronavirus,"" Jones said. ""We are all very worried"".

05 Feb 2020 06:35AM,Indonesian health ministry says lab has all needed equipment to detect novel coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners JAKARTA: The Indonesian Health Ministry said it has all the required resources to test patients for the novel coronavirus. This came after media reports suggesting that Indonesia, which has no cases detected so far, lacks testing kits to rapidly detect any infections. The Health Ministry’s chief of biomedical research centre, Dr Vivi Setiawaty said Indonesia has followed guidelines set by the World Health Organization (WHO) since late December, when the new coronavirus strain was detected. “Ever since the outbreak occurred, the WHO has issued guidelines on how to detect the virus. The WHO issued a checklist and … (WHO) indicated that Indonesia is deemed capable of detecting the coronavirus,” she said during a Monday (Feb 3) press conference. “We have all the equipment needed.” Dr Setiawaty said the WHO checklist includes the acquisition of particular reagents - a substance or compound used in chemical analysis - which will react to coronavirus. “We have run through the checklist of what reagents we need so we can run the tests. Indonesia has acquired such reagents and we can run the tests according to the recommendations issued by WHO,” the doctor added. Dr Setiawaty said the ministry’s laboratory is currently capable of testing up to 1,200 samples. She also said that the facility and all the workers performing the tests have received WHO certification. “The lab has been accredited for emerging and re-emerging diseases, such as the novel coronavirus,” she said. To minimise errors, Dr Setiawaty noted that patients are tested multiple times and results are known in two days.   She said 38 people have been tested so far in Indonesia and all tested negative. More than 20,000 people have been infected by the virus, believed to have emerged in December from a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan. More than 400 people have died from the outbreak. WHO has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency as the virus spread to more than 20 countries including those as far away as Finland, France, the United States and the United Kingdom. But Indonesia, a country of 264 million people, appeared to have been spared from the outbreak, even as neighbouring countries like Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Australia have confirmed cases of the coronavirus. There are concerns on the ground over whether there may be loopholes in the Indonesian system, in terms of pandemic preparedness and virus testing. “We hope that Indonesia continues to be free from the outbreak,” Dr Windra Waworuntu, the Indonesian Health Ministry’s director for communicable diseases told reporters at the same press conference, adding that Indonesia is ready should an outbreak occur in the country.   “We have been communicating with other institutions. We are working with hospitals. We have checked the readiness of all health workers in the country. We continuously monitor the spread of the virus. We continuously monitor the number of confirmed cases and deaths around the world,” she said. “There are international laws which we have to adhere to. We are following WHO guidelines.” VIRUS DETECTION PROCESS CAN TAKE AT LEAST TWO DAYS Testing for the novel coronavirus is a tedious process. Professor Raden Wasito, a pathologist from Yogyakarta’s Gadjah Mada University who has been studying a wide variety of coronaviruses since 1988, said the suspected virus will normally be introduced to a corresponding antibody and see if the two react. For instance, if the virus is suspected to be Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), then it will be introduced to SARS antibody. “The problem is we don’t have an antibody for Wuhan coronavirus. No country has it. It hasn’t been discovered,” Prof Wasito said. This means that scientists around the world rely on the use of reagents and genetic sequencing to identify the novel coronavirus, a process which can take at least two days. To do that, the DNA or RNA sample of the virus will first have to be amplified so there is a large enough amount to study, said Professor Amin Soebandrio, a microbiologist with the Eijkman Institute, one of only two facilities certified to detect emerging viruses in Indonesia. Once millions of DNA or RNA copies are produced, they are introduced to a particular set of reagents to see if it causes a reaction, he told CNA. This step will determine whether a virus comes from the coronavirus family, which includes SARS, MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and viruses which only infect animals. “There are more than 200 types of coronaviruses. If it comes out positive for coronavirus, we then need to know which type. “And that is where the confirmation stage comes in, by looking at the genetic sequence of the virus and comparing it with the references provided by WHO,” Prof Soebandrio said. He added that Indonesia uses the same method as the rest of the world. METHODS NOT FOOLPROOF Nonetheless, Prof Wasito warned that the method currently employed is not without its flaws. A virus needs a host to survive, and in a process which requires a virus sample to spend days inside a lab, there is a chance of its RNA falling apart. “If the virus is dead or if its tissue is broken, the virus will produce an enzyme called RNase which destroys the RNA,” he said. “When a virus with a damaged RNA is tested, a false positive is possible and conversely it could also lead to a false negative.”   Dr Setiawaty of the Health Ministry’s biomedical research centre said to prevent a false outcome, patients have to be tested multiple times. “We collect samples from every patient at least twice, a day apart,” she said, adding that more tests will be conducted if the outcomes of both tests are inconsistent. Dr Setiawaty said her laboratory is taking all the precautions needed to accurately test patients. “We make sure that the samples don’t get contaminated. We have been working very meticulously to ensure the accuracy of our tests.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

02 Feb 2020 12:37PM,Japan confirms three new cases of Wuhan coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TOKYO: Japan confirmed three new cases of the Wuhan coronavirus among evacuees from the Chinese city of Wuhan, including one who initially tested negative, the health ministry said on Saturday (Feb 1). It brings the country’s total number of confirmed cases to 20. One of the three, a man in his 40s who had symptoms such as fever and coughing, first tested negative for coronavirus, the ministry said. But the man, who was initially diagnosed with pneumonia, was later confirmed positive for the virus with an additional test, it said. The government plans to send another chartered plane mid-week or later to bring back Japanese nationals who are still in China’s Hubei province and its provincial capital Wuhan, where the disease is thought to have originated, the foreign ministry said on Sunday. Japan has emailed its citizens in the province to tell them of its plan, and is negotiating with China about Chinese spouses of Japanese citizens who also wish to travel to Japan, it said. The death toll in China soared to 304 on Sunday, with authorities reporting 45 new deaths from the previous day. There were 2,590 new confirmed cases in China, bringing the total to nearly 14,500.

31 Jan 2020 03:45PM,Malaysia to send 18 million medical gloves to Wuhan for healthcare workers amid coronavirus outbreak,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian government will be sending 18 million pieces of medical gloves to healthcare workers in Wuhan amid an escalating coronavirus outbreak. In a statement on Friday (Jan 31), Primary Industries Minister Teresa Kok said Malaysia is in full solidarity with the people of Wuhan. “At present, hospitals in Wuhan, the Central Chinese city, at the crux of the coronavirus outbreak, are calling out for much needed protective medical supplies such as masks, suits and gloves, as supplies run low. “The medical gloves, both natural rubber and nitrile, will be sent to China in batches with the first shipment being already on its way to Wuhan,” she said. Ms Kok said that her ministry had obtained the cooperation of the Malaysian Rubber Export Promotion Council (MREPC) and rubber gloves manufacturers in Malaysia on the initiative. It was during the Chinese New Year period but the companies stepped forward and gave their commitment in ensuring this initiative would be a success, she said. ""Malaysian glove industry players are prepared to be at the forefront of supplying high-quality medical gloves to the world, especially in critical times such as this to battle against the outbreak and the current pandemic,"" she said. Two companies, Top Glove and Supermax have already donated 2.3 million pieces of gloves through their local offices and distributors to Wuhan, she said.   Malaysia is the world's leading producer of medical gloves, with approximately 180 billion pieces exported worldwide annually. In 2014, Malaysia sent more than 20 million medical rubber gloves to five African nations (Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Nigeria and Congo) which were battling the deadly Ebola virus. China has been Malaysia's largest trading partner for 10 consecutive years, with trade growing 8.1 per cent to RM313.8 billion (US$76.7 billion) in 2018. On Friday, the World Health Organisation declared the 2019-nCov outbreak a global health emergency. As a measure to contain the virus, the Chinese government earlier announced a lockdown of 16 different cities, including Wuhan. The virus has claimed over 200 lives in China. Nearly 10,000 cases have been confirmed worldwide. Malaysia currently has eight confirmed cases, all of which involve Chinese nationals. Malaysia has said it will initiate a negotiation as soon as possible with the Chinese government to bring home 82 citizens in Wuhan.   On Wednesday, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said: “Right now, they (Malaysian citizens) are not allowed to leave Wuhan, but we want to negotiate with the Chinese government so that the Malaysian citizens who are not sick can (be allowed to) return to Malaysia"". He said if China allows them to return, they will be subject to 14 days of quarantine to make sure that they are not suffering from infection. Additionally, Dr Mahathir said Putrajaya will bring in supplies to help the Chinese government when sending charter flights to bring Malaysians home. “We are interested to help Wuhan, so if we have to send a charter flight to evacuate our citizens from Wuhan, if allowed by the Chinese government, we will also bring food, gloves and face masks because they are facing supply shortage over there,” he said.

03 Feb 2020 05:31PM,Novel coronavirus: Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announces suspension of 10 border crossings with mainland China,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners HONG KONG: Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced on Monday (Feb 3) the suspension of 10 border crossings out of 13 with mainland China in a bid to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, stopping short of calls for the entire border to be closed. The city's airport - one of the world's busiest - would remain open to mainlanders, although there are already restrictions on people from central Hubei province where the epidemic began. Lam, chief executive of Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, was speaking hours after more than 2,500 workers from the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance (HAEA) went on strike to call for the border to be shut and better protection for hospital staff, among other demands. ""We should be united if we have the same goal. At this critical moment, (some people are) taking extreme means and it is inevitable it will affect the rights of patients,"" Lam said. ""Those using extreme means to try to force the government's hand will not succeed."" The Hospital Authority said those using extreme means ""to try to force the government and Hospital Authority’s hands will not succeed"". Striking workers at the Hospital Authority building booed as they watched Lam speak, calling her a liar and chanting: ""Close all borders."" The medical workers, members of the newly formed union, held a press conference shortly after Lam spoke and said they planned to keep up their strike action. HAEA chairwoman Winnie Yu said she expected around 9,000 of the alliance's roughly 18,000 members to strike on Tuesday. The HAEA's five demands are for the government to close the border, distribute masks to the public, ensure that front-line medical workers have adequate supplies and protection, provide enough isolation wards for patients and guarantee no reprisals for strikers.   Lam said the latest closures - which came after four crossings were shuttered last week - would reduce the number of Chinese mainlanders and allow officials to focus resources on two land entry points as well as the airport. ""The numbers will come down,"" she told reporters. Lam had already closed some border operations, including cross-border ferries and high-speed rail services to the mainland. She has said that closing the entire border would be ""inappropriate and impractical"" as well as ""discriminatory"". She also said that the city faces a shortage of masks, an issue that cannot be solved in a short period of time. Hong Kong has 15 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, which emerged in central China in December and has killed more than 360 people there. Residents have emptied shelves in major supermarkets in Hong Kong, stockpiling meat, rice and cleaning products as fears escalate over the coronavirus outbreak. About 90 per cent of the city's food is imported, with the bulk coming from the mainland, according to official data. The coronavirus is expected to pile pressure on the city's economy, which sank into recession in the third quarter as the often violent protests scared away tourists and took a heavy toll on retailers.

05 Feb 2020 07:29PM,"Deep cleaning measures at Grand Hyatt hotel linked to Malaysian, South Korean coronavirus cases","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The Singapore hotel that hosted three guests from Malaysia and South Korea diagnosed with the coronavirus said on Thursday (Feb 6) that it has since engaged an external agency to deep clean all its guestrooms. Mr Willi Martin, general manager of Grand Hyatt Singapore said: ""The Singapore Ministry of Health is still investigating the cases with the relevant authorities and has not advised details on how, where or when these individuals were infected with the virus."" The hotel has ""elevated precautionary operational protocols"" since receiving this news, he added. Deep cleaning measures have also been extended to public areas and restaurants, and the hotel's Damai's Spa and Fitness Centre. The hotel has engaged a government-appointed external agency to conduct a thorough sanitisation and deep cleaning of the guestrooms, and is strictly following the National Environment Agency's Sanitisation and Hygiene advisory for hotel operators, said Mr Martin. Malaysia's Health Ministry announced its first citizen case of the novel coronavirus on Tuesday. According to Singapore's Ministry of Health (MOH) the 42-year-old Malaysian man had attended a business meeting at Singapore's Grand Hyatt hotel that involved Chinese nationals. The sister of the Malaysian man on Thursday also tested positive for the virus, becoming the country's first locally transmitted case. In an update on Wednesday, MOH said the Jan 20 to 22 meeting was attended by 109 participants from one company. Of those, 15 were Singapore residents and 94 were from overseas, said MOH. All of the overseas participants have left Singapore and MOH has informed the relevant health authorities, it said. Grand Hyatt's marketing communications manager Gerald Kheng confirmed that the Malaysian had stayed at the hotel on Scotts Road from Jan 16 to Jan 23, and was diagnosed more than a week after returning home to Malaysia. ""We understand that the guest first experienced symptoms following his return home and was subsequently diagnosed by local authorities in Malaysia,"" he said on Wednesday. ""The Singapore Ministry of Health is still investigating the case and has not advised details on how, where and when this individual was infected with the virus. ""At this time, we are not aware of any other confirmed or suspected cases among our hotel guests or colleagues."" He said the hotel will support local authorities as they look into the situation. TRACKING CLOSE CONTACTS On Tuesday, authorities said they are tracking the Malaysian man's close contacts. He had developed symptoms on Jan 29 and tested positive for the novel coronavirus on Feb 3, they added. Speaking to reporters at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, MOH's director of medical services Kenneth Mak said Singapore was in touch with authorities in Malaysia. “We have got excellent relations with the Malaysian health authorities, we have been cooperating bilaterally,” Associate Professor Mak said. He added: “We understand that the particular risk exposure was quite some time ago … There is a possibility that many of the people that took part in this particular meeting may (not be) in Singapore anymore.” The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said on Wednesday that a confirmed case – a 38-year-old South Korean man – had visited Singapore for a conference from Jan 18 to Jan 24. South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that the South Korean man had met with the Malaysian man who was later tested positive for the coronavirus. On Wednesday evening, South Korean authorities confirmed another case of the virus. The 36-year-old man had attended the same conference as the 38-year-old South Korean man, the Korean Herald reported. He too had come in contact with the Malaysian who tested positive for the coronavirus. Authorities have not confirmed if they met at the Grand Hyatt hotel. The South Korean man visited a local screening centre on Tuesday after becoming aware of the confirmed case in Malaysia, and was tested positive on Wednesday.

05 Feb 2020 05:03PM,Two Malaysians evacuated from Wuhan tested positive for novel coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners KUALA LUMPUR: Two Malaysians evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan have been tested positive for the novel coronavirus, bringing the total confirmed cases in the country to 12. Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad said in a press conference on Wednesday (Feb 5) that the 45-year-old man and his nine-year-old son are now being treated in an isolation ward at Tuanku Ja’afar Hospital in Seremban, Negeri Sembilan. “They were asymptomatic (upon arrival in Malaysia), but in the end tested positive,” he said. On Tuesday, a total of 107 Malaysian citizens and their non-Malaysian spouses and children were brought back to Kuala Lumpur from Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, on a special flight. Upon arrival, two of the passengers who displayed symptoms were immediately sent to the hospital. They were later tested negative, Dr Dzulkefly said.   Following health screening at the Air Disaster Unit of Kuala Lumpur International Airport, the rest of the 105 individuals - including the father-and-son duo - were ferried to a surveillance centre at Nilai, Negeri Sembilan to be quarantined for 14 days. The two had originally shown no symptoms, but were later confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus, he explained. “They are now in a stable condition,” he said. Meanwhile, Dr Dzulkefly said a hazmat team was deployed to Kuala Lumpur City Centre, where the Petronas Twin Towers are located, to bring a Canadian lady to a hospital to check for possible coronavirus infection. While her actual illness was not ascertained yet, the minister said the immediate thing that came to mind was nCoV. “That’s why we sent a full hazmat team. We are not taking any chances. We will take all measures. Better be safe than sorry,” he said. CONTACT TRACING IN PROGRESS FOR FIRST MALAYSIAN MAN INFECTED Providing further updates on the first Malaysian who was infected with the coronavirus, Dr Dzulkefly said the ministry had identified 74 individuals who have had close contact with the patient. “Thirty-five of them had been tracked and their samples were taken. Subsequently, they will immediately undergo home surveillance. “The process of contact tracing is still undergoing ... We leave no stone unturned,” the minister said. On Tuesday, the authorities said the Malaysian man attended a conference in Singapore from Jan 16 to Jan 23 at the Grand Hyatt Hotel that involved Chinese nationals. Responding to CNA's queries, the health ministry said out of the 74, nine were his family members. Twenty-six of the 35 close contacts tested negative for coronavirus, while the remaining 9 were awaiting results. His house has also been disinfected, it said. He does not have a travel history to China, the ministry added. On Wednesday, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said a 38-year-old South Korean man, who had come into contact with the Malaysian in Singapore, had also been infected.

Test results are still coming in as passengers on the Diamond Princess face a two-week quarantine against the the virus, which has killed hundreds of people, most of them in China. Japanese authorities had earlier tested 279 people on board the cruise ship, finding 64 of them were infected with the coronavirus. Aside from infections on board the ship, Japan has reported 26 cases. The Diamond Princess was quarantined after a former passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong last month was diagnosed with the virus. There were more than 3,700 passengers and crew on the ship when it arrived off Japan's coast last week. Dozens have been taken to hospital and around 3,600 people, many of them elderly, were still on board on Sunday. It was not clear whether Japanese authorities would conduct tests on all of them. The ship docked in Yokohama on Sunday to resupply for a quarantine that could last until Feb 19. Local reports said Japan's health authorities brought urgently needed drugs and other medical supplies to about 500 people. About 100 said they had a fever or felt unwell, according to the reports. Passengers on the ship have been asked to stay inside their cabins to prevent new infections with some expressing confusion and frustration. Television footage has shown a Japanese flag hung on a balcony with the message: ""Drug shortage is serious.""

06 Feb 2020 09:52PM,"Singapore confirms 2 more coronavirus cases, including 1 who attended Grand Hyatt meeting","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners One of the new patients appears to have no links to previous confirmed cases, said the Ministry of Health. SINGAPORE: Singapore confirmed two new cases of the novel coronavirus on Thursday (Feb 6), bringing the total number of people infected in the country to 30, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said. One of the cases is a 41-year-old Singaporean with no recent travel history to China and who does not appear to be linked with previous confirmed cases, MOH added. He was admitted to Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital on Monday and was confirmed to have the virus at 11pm on Wednesday. According to MOH, the man said he had developed a fever on Jan 28 and visited a GP clinic the next day. On Jan 30, he sought treatment at another GP clinic before being admitted to Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital on Monday. Epidemiological investigations and contact tracing are ongoing to identify individuals who had close contact with this patient, said MOH, and to establish any contact he may have had with confirmed cases in Singapore or travellers from mainland China. CASE 30 ATTENDED GRAND HYATT MEETING Another confirmed case is a 27-year-old Singaporean who also had no recent travel history to China. According to MOH, he is one of the four Singapore residents who are being investigated at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) after attending a private business meeting at Grand Hyatt Singapore from Jan 20 to 22. The meeting included participants from China, including Hubei province, as well as the confirmed cases from Malaysia and South Korea. Subsequent test results confirmed infection with the novel coronavirus on Feb 6 at about 2pm. Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing, MOH said, adding that, once identified, they will also be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. The number of close contacts identified by MOH as of noon on Thursday is 435. Of the 353 still in Singapore, 348 have been contacted and have either been quarantined or isolated, said the health ministry. Efforts are ongoing to reach out to five more close contacts, MOH added. In response to CNA's queries, Grand Hyatt on Friday morning said that none of its employees have been diagnosed as a suspect or confirmed case. ""The hotel is conducting daily temperature checks for all colleagues and contractors whilst entering or exiting the hotel,"" said the spokesperson. ""Our colleagues will continue to remain vigilant in monitoring symptoms among colleagues and guests.""   CONDITION OF TWO EARLIER PATIENTS WORSEN Of the earlier confirmed cases, MOH said that two patients' conditions have worsened, with one in critical condition in the intensive care unit. Another requires additional oxygen support. On Thursday night, the ministry also released new information about case 27, the husband of a salesperson at Yong Thai Hang and one of the locally transmitted cases linked to a Chinese tour group that visited the health products shop. The 45-year-old Singaporean developed symptoms on Feb 1, visited a GP clinic the following day and was subsequently isolated at the NCID. Prior to hospital admission, he stayed at his home at Jalan Bukit Merah and worked as a private hire driver, MOH said. He also visited Tiong Bahru Plaza, Tiong Bahru Market and Beo Crescent Market and Food Centre. ""The risk of infection from transient contact, such as on public transport or in public places, is assessed to be low,"" the ministry said. The family's six-month-old son and Indonesian domestic helper also caught the virus and are currently warded in isolation rooms. READ: 12 people from 5 families among confirmed coronavirus cases in Singapore As of noon on Thursday, 310 suspect cases have tested negative, with the test results of the remaining 147 cases pending, MOH added. Singapore confirmed its first case of the novel coronavirus on Jan 23, a 66-year-old Wuhan resident who arrived in Singapore from Guangzhou on Jan 20. To date, one of the 30 confirmed cases has been discharged. Singapore announced its first cluster of local transmission of the virus earlier this week.   Last Friday, it was announced that all new visitors with recent travel history to mainland China will not be allowed to enter Singapore. These visitors will also not be allowed to transit in Singapore. Those with Chinese passports, with the exception of Singapore permanent residents and long-term pass holders, will also not be allowed to enter Singapore. The novel coronavirus is believed to have started in Wuhan in China's Hubei province but has since spread to more than 20 countries around the world. It has killed more than 600 people and infected more than 28,000 globally. The World Health Organization has declared the virus outbreak a global emergency. Most deaths have been in Hubei province and officials have noted that the death rate, at about 2 per cent, is below the mortality rate of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

13 Feb 2020 10:03AM,China transparent in coronavirus response: UN envoy,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: China has handled the new coronavirus outbreak in a transparent and ""highly responsible"" way, the country's UN ambassador said Wednesday (Feb 13), after criticism that local authorities did not react quickly enough. Since its emergence in the central province of Hubei in December, the COVID-19 virus has killed more than 1,350 people and infected tens of thousands. There have been more than 500 infections in almost 30 countries and territories outside mainland China, including two deaths. ""Facing the epidemic, we have always adopted an open, transparent and highly responsible attitude,"" Beijing's United Nations ambassador Zhang Jun told the UN Commission for Social Development. ""We have reported the epidemic information to the WHO, the relevant countries, and Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan regions as soon as it is available, shared the genetic sequences of the virus, actively communicated with other countries in order to come up with responses,"" he said. Most of the cases have been in Hubei, where about 56 million people have been placed under virtual quarantine. Authorities have restricted the movements of people in several other cities far from the epicentre in an unprecedented containment effort. ""Not only for the sake of China, but also the world, we have adopted rigorous prevention and control measures ... effectively curbing the spread of the epidemic,"" Zhang said. China drew international condemnation for covering up cases during the 2002-03 SARS outbreak, whereas the World Health Organization has praised measures taken by Beijing to combat COVID-19.   But anger erupted in China this month after the death of a doctor in Wuhan, the Hubei provincial capital and virus epicentre, whom police silenced when he flagged the emerging virus in December. Local authorities in Hubei and Wuhan had already faced rare, uncensored criticism online for initially downplaying the magnitude of the outbreak. Critics say precious time was lost by the early inaction of the local government. Hubei and Wuhan officials held important political meetings in the first weeks of January. The death toll and number of cases only began to soar afterwards, going from one fatality on Jan 11 to more than 630 barely four weeks later. ""Addressing global public health issues is a common challenge faced by all countries,"" Zhang said, calling for international cooperation.

31 Jan 2020 05:01PM,"Wuhan coronavirus: 1,500 SAF personnel packing 5.2m masks in 24-hour operation","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: A total of 1,500 Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) personnel are packing 5.2 million surgical masks for distribution to the public, as Singapore continues its fight against the Wuhan coronavirus. The round-the-clock packing operation at the SAFTI Military Institute started on Thursday (Jan 30) evening after the multi-ministerial task force announced that each Singapore household will receive a pack of four masks. The SAF will use large vans and operational utility vehicles to deliver the masks to 89 Residents' Committee centres and Community Centres, after which the People's Association (PA) will distribute them to the public.  The SAF personnel are working eight-hour shifts, with each shift expected to pack 200,000 masks. They will aim to deliver the first batch of masks on Friday evening and finish the operation by Saturday evening.   Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said the SAF is “very aware” that all agencies in Singapore have to “lean forward” to do its part in tackling the Wuhan coronavirus. “Every new biological outbreak can be very serious if we are not quick enough to take up the right measures,” he told reporters at the packing area on Friday. This comes as Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said on Thursday that there is a sufficient supply of masks in Singapore if managed properly, amid concerns over a lack of availability at retailers islandwide. Many people in Singapore are donning surgical masks as a form of protection against the coronavirus, although experts have cautioned it could create a ""false sense of security"" if not used properly. FACTORY LINE On Friday, 450 servicemen wearing gloves, masks and hair nets sat at rows of tables in a large hall – chosen for its sterile environment and proximity to a transport line. Servicemen who leave the hall have to sanitise their hands before returning to the tables. They removed masks from a small box and placed four of them in a Ziploc bag. These then go into a larger carton that can contain 400 of such bags. Each van can carry up to 14,000 bags.   Other servicemen help to pack the large cartons and move them to vehicles waiting outside. After this 8am shift ends at 4pm, another will take over. The SAF personnel include non-uniformed staff as well as full-time national servicemen and regulars from the Combat Service Support Command. Dr Ng said the servicemen took a few hours after being activated to prepare the entire set-up, including getting materials like masks, ziploc bags and packing boxes from various agencies. Nevertheless, he said the servicemen were “on track” with their progress, adding that they were in good spirits.   “You know that when you do this, you’re doing it to protect your family and fellow Singaporeans, and you’re very proud of it,” he stated. It is not the first time the SAF is conducting such an operation – during the haze crisis in 2013, it packed and distributed more than 1 million masks to the public through the PA. CONTACT TRACING, TEMPERATURE SCREENING The SAF is also helping out in other areas of the battle against the Wuhan coronavirus. Dr Ng said that as part of contact tracing, SAF personnel are making a hundred calls a day to people in Singapore who have travelled to Hubei province recently to ask about their condition. They are also manning thermal imagery equipment at airports and will inform airport staff if they detect symptomatic passengers. The minister stressed that these SAF personnel are not in direct contact with passengers, adding that they were not trained to do so.   Dr Ng had also said in a Facebook post on Thursday that the SAF is using its premises for quarantine cases. On Friday, he said the SAF is “careful” to ensure it maintains operational readiness even as it deploys resources to contain the Wuhan coronavirus. “Even though it’s a national effort, we want to make sure that the SAF keeps its eye on its primary responsibility,” he said. “We will not compromise security, even though this is important, and that is why we mobilised the Combat Service Support Command, whereas other operational units are still on tasking.” When asked if there are SAF servicemen currently in China, Dr Ng said the SAF has instructed personnel to defer non-essential travel to the country, adding that there were also no upcoming bilateral exercises with China. ""Even if (the trip to China is) important, they have to get clearance,"" he added.

05 Feb 2020 07:01AM,China coronavirus death toll rises to 490 as more countries confirm local transmission,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The number of confirmed deaths from China's coronavirus outbreak jumped on Wednesday (Feb 5) to nearly 500, after Hong Kong reported its first death from the disease and millions more in China were ordered to stay indoors. The confirmed toll in mainland China rose to 490 after hardest-hit Hubei province reported 65 more people had died - the biggest single-day tally since the first fatalities emerged last month. The number of confirmed infections in China's coronavirus outbreak has reached 24,324 nationwide with 3,887 new cases reported, the National Health Commission said. More than 20 countries have confirmed cases of the virus, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a global health emergency, several governments to institute travel restrictions, and airlines to suspend flights to and from China. The WHO said Tuesday that the dramatic measures taken by China had provided a ""window of opportunity"" to halt transmission, while calling for more global solidarity to combat the virus.   The novel coronavirus has continued to spread with Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand on Tuesday reporting new infections that were not imported from China. In a sign of growing concern about a spread to other densely-populated Chinese metropolitan areas, authorities in three cities in eastern Zhejiang province - including one near Shanghai - limited the number of people allowed to leave their homes. Three districts in Hangzhou - including the area where the main office of Chinese tech giant Alibaba is based - now allow only one person per household to go outside every two days to buy necessities, affecting some three million people. The city is only 175km southwest of the financial hub of Shanghai, which has reported more than 200 cases, including one death.   Zhejiang has confirmed 829 cases - the highest number outside the central province of Hubei, whose capital Wuhan is the epicentre of the outbreak. The disease is believed to have emerged in December in a Wuhan market that sold wild animals, and spread rapidly as people travelled for the Lunar New Year holiday in January. China has struggled to contain the virus despite enacting unprecedented measures, including virtually locking down more than 50 million people in Hubei.   The WHO has said the outbreak does not yet constitute a ""pandemic"". The head of the organisation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, accused wealthy countries of falling short on their duties in sharing data, stating that: ""Of the 176 cases reported outside China so far, WHO has received complete case report forms for only 38 per cent."" HONG KONG'S FIRST DEATH The death of the 39-year-old man in Hong Kong came as the semi-autonomous city closed all but two land crossings with the Chinese mainland. Hong Kong media said the man had underlying health issues. He had visited Wuhan last month and his 72-year-old mother was also infected. The financial hub has been particularly on edge over the virus as it has revived memories of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002-03, which killed nearly 300 people in the city and 349 people in the mainland. Health officials noted that the mortality rate for the new coronavirus stood at 2.1 per cent, with most victims either old or with underlying health problems. SARS killed nearly 10 per cent of patients. NEW FOREIGN CASES Singapore confirmed the first four cases of people being infected locally, taking the total number of infections to 24. In another example of growing global anxiety, Japan has quarantined a cruise ship carrying 3,711 people and was testing those onboard for the virus after a former passenger was diagnosed with the illness in Hong Kong. Macau, China's semi-autonomous gambling hub that is popular with mainland Chinese visitors, decided to temporarily close all of its casinos for at least two weeks. And the UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Tuesday advised Britons to leave China, ""if they can"", to minimise their risk of exposure to the virus. The United States, meanwhile, acknowledged that the outbreak may delay Beijing's plans to purchase American goods under the terms of a deal meant to end the two countries' trade war. BEIJING ADMITS 'SHORTCOMINGS' China's Communist leadership made a rare admission of fallibility earlier this week, acknowledging ""shortcomings and difficulties exposed in the response to the epidemic"". The elite Politburo Standing Committee called for improvements to the ""national emergency management system"" at the meeting, according to the official Xinhua news agency on Monday. The government also said it ""urgently"" needed medical equipment such as surgical masks, protective suits, and safety goggles as it battles the outbreak. Most of the deaths have been in Wuhan and the rest of surrounding Hubei province, which has largely been under lockdown for almost two weeks. A 1,000-bed field hospital in Wuhan built from scratch within two weeks to relieve overburdened medical facilities started receiving patients on Tuesday, with a second makeshift hospital due to open later this week. A cultural building, an exhibition centre and a gymnasium have also been converted into improvised clinics with 3,400 beds. State media reported that the city planned to convert an additional eight facilities into hospitals.

02 Feb 2020 04:24PM,"Wuhan coronavirus: Licence fees waived for hotels, travel agents and tour guides, cleaning costs subsidised","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Licence fees for hotels, travel agents and tour guides will be waived as part of measures to help the tourism sector in Singapore that has been “directly affected” by the Wuhan coronavirus, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) said on Sunday (Feb 2). STB will also defray the cleaning costs of hotels that provided accommodation to the confirmed and suspected cases of the coronavirus infections. These schemes are the first steps in a wider set of measures to help tourism businesses “mitigate the immediate impact” of the coronavirus outbreak, STB added.   These measures come after feedback from trade associations and chambers, said Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing. He said at the Oasia Hotel Downtown: ""I just want to assure the businesses and our workers that the survival of the businesses, and in the turn, the sustainability of the jobs for Singaporeans will be our primary focus."" Oasia Hotel Downtown was where Singapore's 13th confirmed case of the Wuhan virus stayed prior to being tested positive for the coronavirus. The 73-year-old arrived in Singapore on Jan 21 and developed symptoms seven days later. Mr Chan told reporters that Singaporeans should be ""mentally prepared"" for the impact of the coronavirus to be ""wider, deeper and longer"" than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. This is because China's trade with Singapore and its GDP have both gone up four times since then. ""What we must be mentally prepared for is that the impact of any disruption to the Chinese economy, to the supply chains, is likely to be much wider, much deeper, because of the interlinkages with the global economy - certainly with the Singapore economy,"" he said.   ""The tourism sector has already been directly affected by the novel coronavirus, due to a decline in visitor arrivals, especially from China,"" STB said in its media release on Sunday. Tourists from China account for about 20 per cent of Singapore’s total international visitor arrivals, with about 3.6 million visitors to Singapore in 2019, the tourism board added. Earlier this week, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong announced wider travel restrictions to include all new visitors – regardless of nationality – with recent travel history to China. These visitors will also not be allowed to transit in Singapore, as part of restrictions that came into effect at 11.59pm on Saturday. Those with Chinese passports, with the exception of Singapore permanent residents (PRs) and long-term pass holders, will also not be allowed to enter Singapore. All forms of new visas to Chinese passport holders have been suspended, and Singapore’s status as a visa-free transit facility has also been suspended for those with Chinese passports. HELP WITH CLEANING AND LICENCE FEES There have been 18 confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore. Of the 18, 16 are travellers from Wuhan and two are Singaporeans who were evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30. The tourism board said hotels that provided accommodation to suspected and confirmed cases will get help with their environmental cleaning and disinfection costs. “STB will cover up to 50 per cent of third-party professional cleaning fees, capped at S$20,000 per establishment for hotels with confirmed cases; and S$10,000 per establishment for hotels with suspected cases,” the board added. This will be backdated to Jan 23, when the first confirmed case in Singapore was detected. Licence fees for hotels for the rest of 2020 will also be waived by the Hotels Licensing Board. “Similarly, travel agents and tourist guides whose licences are due for renewal in 2020 will not need to pay to renew their licence fees,” STB said. Chief executive of STB Keith Tan said: ""Over the past week, STB has been in close contact with our tourism partners to understand their difficulties and to assess the impact. ""We know the situation is likely to persist, and recognise we need to move quickly to support the industry and build confidence. ""STB will continue to identify targeted and effective ways to support the tourism industry so that they are well-positioned to grow swiftly once we start to recover."" Full details of the overall package of relief measures will be announced at Budget 2020 on Feb 18.   The Government is ""keenly aware"" that some front-line workers are ""particularly worried"" about coming into contact with unwell guests or customers, added Manpower Minister Josephine Teo. She said that the Singapore National Employers Federation and the Singapore Business Federation will issue an advisory to employers with such workers. ""(The advisory will explain) what they can do to provide these workers with support. They need guidance on how to deal with unwell customers, and the advisory will give some specific suggestions,"" she said. Workers who are placed on leave of absences are not unwell and should not be evicted by landlords, co-tenants or dormitory operators, added Mrs Teo. There have been reports of such evictions, Communications and Information Minister S Iswaran had said on Friday. ""There's really no need to do so. It is completely unhelpful. And this is a time where we actually need to provide care and support to each other,"" Mrs Teo said. She noted that placing workers on leave is an extra precaution to minimise social contact. ""We must always be mindful that even as we take these extra precautions, we should be supportive to the people who are affected by the leave of absence,"" she said.

10 Feb 2020 07:40PM,"Singapore Airlines, SilkAir suspend some flights to China over coronavirus outbreak","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore Airlines (SIA) and its regional wing SilkAir will suspend some flights to China after fears over the novel coronavirus outbreak affected demand ""significantly"", Singapore's national carrier said on Monday (Feb 10). ""Minimum connectivity"" to several key cities will be maintained, SIA said. The move comes after demand for air travel between Singapore and China declined significantly as a result of the outbreak, said SIA on its website. As a result, services to some Chinese destinations will be ""temporarily suspended until the situation improves"", it added. Several SIA flights between Singapore and Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou will be suspended between Feb 4 and Mar 29. Some SilkAir flights between Singapore and Shenzhen, Xiamen, Chengdu and Chongqing will be halted during that period.  SIA said that the group will maintain some connectivity to key cities. In response to queries, SIA told CNA that following the reduced frequencies, it will operate seven flights each to Beijing and Shanghai weekly, thrice a week to Guangzhou and once a week to Chongqing. ""There are still many Singaporeans working and living in China now, many of whom will still require connectivity between Singapore and China,"" said SIA. ""As the national carrier, we will continue to maintain minimum connectivity to the key cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chongqing for now despite the reduced demand,"" added SIA.   SIA had said on Jan 31 said it would reduce capacity on some of its routes to China in February due to the growing scale of the coronavirus epidemic. SIA's low-cost carrier Scoot also suspended flights to 11 Chinese cities from early February until the end of March and reduced frequencies to eight other Chinese destinations.  Singapore on Friday raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange, after several cases of coronavirus without travel history to mainland China or links to previous cases. The virus has infected 43 people in Singapore as of Sunday, six of whom have been discharged.

04 Feb 2020 10:43AM,Hong Kong reports first coronavirus death,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners HONG KONG: A man has died in Hong Kong from the novel coronavirus, the city's first fatality from the deadly virus and the second outside mainland China. Medical authorities confirmed a 39-year-old man who was being treated for the virus died on Tuesday morning (Feb 4).  The man was a resident of Hong Kong who had travelled last month to Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak, returning home on Jan 23 via a high-speed rail link. Officials said the man also had diabetes, but had been stable until his condition suddenly deteriorated. They said the precise cause of death was unclear and the case will be handed over to the coroner. So far the only other reported fatality outside of the Chinese mainland has been in the Philippines. Hong Kong now has 17 confirmed cases, most of whom were infected in mainland China. But four cases are suspected to be local transmissions, including two people confirmed on Tuesday afternoon who have no history of recent travel to the mainland.   ""NEXT 14 DAYS ARE CRITICAL"" Chuang Shuk-kwan, from Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection, said the local transmissions were a cause for concern as it could suggest the city's outbreak was becoming self-sustaining. ""We can't rule out the possibility that there will be massive transmission in the near future. So the next 14 days are very critical,"" he told reporters. The death came a day after Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced the closure of all but two land border crossings to the Chinese mainland in a bid to halt the spread of the virus. Lam has rejected calls to shut the entire border, saying such a move would be ""inappropriate and impractical"" as well as ""discriminatory"". There has been growing public anger over the government's response to the outbreak, with calls to seal the border entirely - including barring mainlanders from flying into the international airport. There is also an acute shortage of masks, while a strike by some medical workers entered its second day on Tuesday with hospital authorities saying 4,400 staff members were absent - including around 360 doctors and 2,500 nurses. The authorities said the strike was having a ""serious impact"".   While Hong Kong maintains close economic and cultural links to the Chinese mainland, a seething distrust of the authorities in Beijing permeates the city. The 2003 outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, which Beijing initially covered up, killed almost 300 people in Hong Kong and left lasting psychological scars on the densely populated city. Distrust - and at times open hostility - towards mainlanders has been worsened by years of political unrest as Hong Kongers chafe under Beijing's rule, and protest for greater democratic freedoms. The World Health Organization has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency, although experts say much is still unknown about the pathogen, including its mortality rate and transmission pathways.  The number of confirmed deaths from China's coronavirus outbreak soared past 400 on Tuesday, after authorities in Hubei province reported 64 new fatalities. There was also a sharp increase in confirmed infections with 3,235 new cases, putting the national total at more than 20,400. The death toll in mainland China now surpasses the number of fatalities from its SARS crisis two decades ago. More than 20 other countries have reported cases of infections.

11 Feb 2020 05:42AM,Countries rush to build diagnostic capacity as coronavirus spreads,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners GENEVA: A week ago, only two laboratories in Africa could diagnose the novel coronavirus that originated in China and is rapidly spreading around the world. As of Sunday, the World Health Organization (WHO) expected every nation in Africa to be able to diagnose the disease. The rush reflects a global push for diagnostic capabilities, particularly in developing countries, in hopes of averting a global pandemic. But it is being slowed by a desperate need for virus samples necessary to validate the tests. ""Without vital diagnostic capacity, countries are in the dark as to how far and wide the virus has spread and who has coronavirus or another disease with similar symptoms,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference in Geneva on Monday. As of early Monday, there had been 40,235 confirmed cases reported in China and 909 deaths, as well as 319 cases in 24 other countries, including one death. Most of the testing is being done by public health laboratories. But several companies including Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, GenScript Biotech Corp and Co-Diagnostics Inc have developed tests and are taking steps to get them validated for clinical use. Roche is distributing coronavirus tests developed by Tib Molbiol of Berlin for research use on some of its instruments while developing a test of its own. Abbott Laboratories also is working on a test. WHO has activated a network of 15 referral laboratories that can support national efforts in confirming new cases, and has identified 168 labs globally with the technology to diagnose the virus. Technicians must be trained to run the tests locally to avoid delays associated with having to send them to centralised labs. On Tuesday, WHO is convening a two-day meeting of hundreds of researchers and manufacturers to address the outbreak. WORKLOAD ON LABS IS 'EXTREME' Researchers are also working to develop antibody tests that can tell whether someone has been exposed to the virus. They could help answer how broadly this virus has spread, and whether there are milder cases not being detected, Dr Mike Ryan, head of the WHO emergency programme, told reporters. China appears to have adequate stock of the materials needed to perform diagnostic tests, but there is a limited number of trained technicians who can run them. ""The workload on those labs is extreme,"" Ryan said. Outside of China, manufacturers are quickly developing tests based on the genetic code of the virus. Those tests still need to be validated with actual virus samples, for which access has been challenging.   Live isolation of the virus allows a huge advance in diagnostics and potential advances in therapeutics and vaccine development, Ryan said. GenScript, which has offices in New Jersey and Nanjing, China, has developed a test available to researchers. It cannot be used as a diagnostic until it has been tested in hundreds of virus samples. ""In China, we couldn't get to the samples directly because we don't have a lab that can handle the virus,"" said Hong Li, a GenScript scientist. The company has sent its test kits to Chinese health officials to assess their validity. ""Because other companies in China are also doing that, we don't know when it will be our turn,"" said Eric Wang, GenScript's head of marketing. Utah-based Co-Diagnostics on Monday said it has started shipping its test, which is available for research purposes, to clients. Chief Scientific Officer Brent Satterfield said last week that the company has been struggling to find clinical virus samples to validate the test for use as a diagnostic. Thermo Fisher developed its tests based on the genetic code of the virus, and ran computer models to validate it. The company has been providing its test to countries and health ministries with access to virus samples, said Thermo Fisher executive Joshua Trotta. ""They will evaluate our kits and make a determination of what is the best test to deploy."" Meanwhile, Thermo Fisher is scaling up production as countries prepare for more cases. Demand is ""growing every day,"" Trotta said.

02 Feb 2020 09:00PM,"Cocktail of flu, HIV drugs appears to help fight coronavirus: Thai doctors","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BANGKOK: Thai doctors have seen success in treating severe cases of the new coronavirus with combination of medications for flu and HIV, with initial results showing vast improvement 48 hours after applying the treatment, they said on Sunday (Feb 2). The doctors from Rajavithi Hospital in Bangkok said a new approach in coronavirus treatment had improved the condition of several patients under their care, including one 70-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan who tested positive for the coronavirus for 10 days. The drug treatment includes a mixture of anti-HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, in combination with flu drug oseltamivir in large doses. ""This is not the cure, but the patient's condition has vastly improved. From testing positive for 10 days under our care, after applying this combination of medicine the test result became negative within 48 hours,"" Dr Kriangska Atipornwanich, a lung specialist at Rajavithi, told reporters. ""The outlook is good but we still have to do more study to determine that this can be a standard treatment."" Chinese health officials have already been administering the HIV and flu drugs to fight the coronavirus. The use of the three together in a cocktail seemed to improve the treatment, the Thai doctors said. Another doctor said that a similar approach in two other patients resulted in one displaying some allergic reaction but the other showed improvement. ""We have been following international practices, but the doctor increased the dosage of one of the drugs,"" said Somsak Akkslim, director-general of the Medical Services Department, referring to the flu medicine Oseltamivir. Thailand has recorded 19 cases of coronavirus. Of the Thai patients, eight have recovered and gone home while 11 are still under treatment in hospitals. Somsak said the health ministry will meet on Monday to discuss the successful treatment in the case of the 70-year-old but said it is still too soon to say that this approach can be applied to all cases. ""Initially we will apply this approach only to severe cases,"" he said.

07 Feb 2020 07:12PM,Taiwan to suspend most flights to mainland China to control novel coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TAIPEI: Taiwan will suspend flights to most cities in mainland China from Monday (Feb 10) due to the coronavirus epidemic but those to the capital Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen and Chengdu will continue, the government said on Friday (Feb 7). The suspension will be in force until Apr 29, the Central Epidemic Command Centre said. The number of flights to the special regions of Hong Kong and Macau from Taiwan will also be reduced, the centre said. Flights from the island go to about two dozen destinations in mainland China. Travellers who arrive in Taiwan from Monday having transited through China, Hong Kong or Macau must quarantine themselves at home for 14 days, it added. Taiwan has reported only 16 cases of coronavirus compared with more than 31,000 in China. Taiwan this week suspended entry to all mainland Chinese citizens who live in China and most visa applications for people from Hong Kong and Macau.

03 Feb 2020 06:05PM,Commentary: How effective are mass quarantines in China in curbing the spread of the novel coronavirus?,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Mass quarantines may allay public fear and provide the illusion of intervention, but they cannot be considered an evidence-based practice, says an expert. LONDON: The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. China has recorded over 17,200 cases, but under 400 deaths from the disease. As far as emerging diseases go, this virus appears relatively insipid. Despite the mild severity of this disease, over 50 million people in Hubei Province have been restricted to their region as Chinese authorities try to prevent the spread of the virus. Wuhan’s public health authorities say they are in a “state of war” and public transport has been shut down in several Chinese cities. Cordoning off ground zero is not unusual in public health emergencies. An outbreak of norovirus or salmonella may lead to restaurant closure. In the case of the novel coronavirus, the wet market from where it may have originated (in Wuhan) was similarly shut down. Removing the suspected source of the disease is necessary but not sufficient. Any public health response to a disease outbreak must prevent transmission of cases to others. And while isolation is a well-established practice for individual cases, quarantining millions of healthy people is unprecedented in public health. Across Asia, facemasks are back in vogue, with Alibaba selling 80 million over two days alone. Given the historical context, this is unsurprising. The Chinese are well acquainted with outbreaks of viral disease. Crystalline memories of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have re-emerged. But it is this very context that raises the question: Is such a drastic response warranted? ILLUSION OF INTERVENTION   Some, looking in from the outside, may welcome mass quarantine. But in reality, it is no better than the usual public health response of isolating cases and potentially high-risk contacts of cases. Going further to isolate those who have any theoretical risk of disease may allay public fear and provide the illusion of intervention, but it cannot be considered an evidence-based practice. First, the argument for mass quarantine rests on the perilous assumption that one person’s risk of infection is the same as another’s, simply because they live in the same region. We know this is not the case, particularly at an early stage in an outbreak, and that there are groups at higher risk who may be identified and targeted first before radical strategies that interfere with usual activities are considered. In fact, any impediment to the day-to-day functions of healthcare and other infrastructure can be a huge problem for disease control. Contact tracing, disease surveillance, public education and administering protective equipment, drugs or vaccines, rely on effective communication with hospitals, primary care, laboratories and other institutions, such as schools or nursing homes. Descending into a zombie-apocalypse scenario does not help in the operational coordination of complex cross-agency public health activities. Second, a Chinese public health response must protect those within the affected region as well as those outside it. The current position ignores the rights of healthy people in and around Wuhan.   If we assume all currently recorded cases are within the city of Wuhan (of approximately 11 million) and not the wider region, then we can conservatively estimate that over 99 per cent of people are not cases. While human-to-human transmission appears to be occurring, preliminary reports don’t suggest that this is a particularly infectious disease. For every one case, the WHO estimates that a further 1.4 to 2.5 (or an average of two) more people are infected. To put this in perspective, for measles, an estimated 12 to 18 people will get infected from a single case. So the vast majority of the population trapped in the region are not unwell and would be unlikely to get infected with an appropriate public health response. Such a geographical lockdown of this magnitude is not just superfluous but also introduces new health problems into the mix. The first week of quarantine has resulted in crowded hospitals, food shortages and the local economy grinding to a standstill. Amid such chaos, even the Chinese will struggle to prevent defectors from fleeing. Also, it is unclear when it would be possible to lift such a lockdown. HIGH PRICE TO PAY With cases increasing by the day, the quarantine looks like it is here to stay, but escalating economic and social pressures will loom large for decision-makers. Surely the billions the quarantine is costing the Chinese economy would be put to better use in developing new diagnostic, preventative or therapeutic technologies for the virus? A quarantine of this scale may create more problems than it solves. Other countries must be careful not to hastily imitate this if and when given the opportunity.

10 Feb 2020 07:19AM,China coronavirus death toll surpasses 900,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The number of deaths from China's new coronavirus surged past 900 in mainland China on Monday (Feb 10) after the hardest-hit province of Hubei reported 91 new fatalities. In its daily update, Hubei's health commission also confirmed another 2,618 new cases in the central province, where the outbreak emerged in December. There are now more than 39,800 confirmed cases across China, based on previously released figures from the government. The new virus is believed to have emerged last year in a market that sells wild animals in Hubei's capital Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, before spreading across the country. The latest data came after the WHO said the last four days had seen ""some stabilising"" in Hubei, but warned the figures could still ""shoot up"". The epidemic has prompted the government to lock down whole cities as anger mounts over its handling of the crisis - especially after a whistleblowing doctor fell victim to the virus.   With much of the country still not back at work after an extended Lunar New Year holiday, cities including financial hub Shanghai ordered residents to wear masks in public. Michael Ryan, head of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, said the ""stable period"" of the outbreak ""may reflect the impact of the control measures"". A WHO ""international expert mission"" left late Sunday for China, the agency's director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Twitter. The mission is led by Bruce Aylward, a veteran of previous health emergencies. While the death toll has climbed steadily, new cases have declined since Wednesday's single-day peak of nearly 3,900 people nationwide. PUBLIC ANGER Millions of people are under lockdown in Hubei in a bid to stop the virus spreading. ""The local government asked people to stay at home as much as possible, but there are not enough goods in shops each time we get there, so we have to go out frequently,"" a woman in Wuhan, surnamed Wei, told AFP. China's central bank said from Monday it would make 300 billion yuan (US$43 billion) available in special loans to banks to help businesses involved in fighting the epidemic. China drew international condemnation for covering up cases during the SARS outbreak, whereas the WHO has praised measures it has taken this time. But anger erupted after the death of a Wuhan doctor who police silenced when he flagged the emerging virus in December. The doctor, 34, died early Friday, after contracting the virus from a patient. Chinese academics were among those angered by his death, with at least two open letters posted on social media demanding more freedoms. ""Put an end to the restrictions on freedom of speech,"" one letter demanded. PERCOLATING ALONG Beijing responded by sending its anti-graft body to launch an investigation, attempting to ease the anger. But Ian Lipkin - a professor at Columbia University who worked with China on the SARS outbreak - said earlier intervention could have made a key difference. ""This virus was percolating along without anyone realising it was there,"" he said. If the quarantine measures have been effective, the epidemic should peak within the next fortnight, Lipkin added - but he warned there is also the risk of a ""bump"" in numbers when people return to work. Wuhan has converted public buildings into makeshift medical centres, and built two new field hospitals. But Wuhan resident Chen Yiping told AFP her 61-year-old mother has severe symptoms and was still waiting for a hospital bed because ""there are too many people in need of treatment"". The first foreign victim in China was confirmed when an American diagnosed with the virus died in Wuhan. The only fatalities outside the mainland have been a Chinese man in the Philippines and a 39-year-old man in Hong Kong. Seventy people on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship off Japan's coast have tested positive, with all passengers told to stay inside their cabins to prevent further infection. Several countries have banned arrivals from China while major airlines have suspended flights.

08 Feb 2020 06:00AM,Commentary: Protecting public health is key in novel coronavirus fight but we must also tackle xenophobia,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Careful terminology, community leadership and responsible behaviour online are needed to stem potential anti-PRC sentiments, say the Institute of Policy Studies’ Mathew Mathews and Shane Pereira. SINGAPORE: Since it was first discovered last December in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the 2019 novel coronavirus has spread internationally. The rapid proliferation of the virus and the accompanying deaths have resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the outbreak to be a global health emergency. Governments all over the world have begun initiating various policies given the source of the virus. These have ranged from travel bans to quarantines of infected visitors – actions that protect countries from a potential community spread of the virus. PROBLEMATIC SENTIMENTS Reactions to the virus has been a mixture of fear and panic. The novel coronavirus has arguably been weaponised by some around the world to justify their racism against Chinese nationals and stoke communal tensions. More than 9,000 people in Canada had signed a petition last Wednesday (Jan 28) urging a district school board to bar students whose family members had recently travelled to China from entering the classroom. Canadians have also reportedly started to avoid Toronto’s Chinatown, with businesses in that area recording a slowdown.   Such measures could have more far-reaching societal consequences. In Canada and Britain, for instance, the outbreak has led to a rise of anti-Asian sentiments and discrimination, sparking fears among the Asian community that they would be targeted racially, as they had been during the 2003 outbreak of SARS. THE PUBLIC HEALTH CALCULATIONS Much has been said about the travel restrictions on Chinese nationals into Singapore and other countries, and whether these moves were potentially discriminatory. Hence, Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam’s explanation on Sunday that the restrictions are not based on nationality or passports but is geographic “in the sense that if you’ve been to China, whoever you are, then the restrictions kick in” is a useful clarification. The further announcement by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority on the nationalities of individuals who have been refused entry into Singapore since the start of the travel restrictions clarifies that the target of restrictions is anyone who might have been susceptible to the virus. Besides five Chinese passport-holders, 10 more – Spanish, British, American, Indian and Malaysians - have been refused entry because of their recent stay in China. The authorities have also made provisions for case-by-case exemptions for Chinese passport-holders who reside outside China and have not been there in the recent past. While there is a need to safeguard public health and enact exclusionary responses, authorities must also monitor cases of xenophobia.   These can exacerbate fault lines in Singapore. Already, there is some level of discomfort with those who originate from China. In the 2019 IPS-OnePeople.sg Indicators of Racial and Religious Harmony which surveyed over 4,000 Singaporean residents, about 20 per cent of Singaporeans were not comfortable with having a neighbour who was previously a Chinese national. One can expect that with the flooding of vitriolic remarks about Chinese nationals globally online driven by the novel coronavirus, there could be higher levels of discomfort. TACKLING ANTI-PRC SENTIMENTS Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, noting these anti-PRC sentiments reported elsewhere in the world, has declared on Saturday that this is “not quite the right approach to take”. Framing this as a medical issue, “an illness” and a virus that “can affect any human being”, he also pointed out that Chinese authorities did not wish it upon themselves and are taking measures to deal with the contagion. Referring to Singapore’s decision to restrict entry to new visitors of any nationality with recent travel history to mainland China, Mr Lee said it was a pre-emptive measure taken purely to protect Singapore’s public health.   It is important that our Prime Minister and other national leaders have taken a stand against such xenophobic reactions. What more can Singapore do to counter potential racism that stems from the novel coronavirus? First, we should work towards disassociating the virus from mainland Chinese. While the term “Wuhan virus” had been used commonly in past few weeks, possibly because we have precedents of associating diseases from where they originated (MERS is the acronym for Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome), it could feed prejudices against Chinese nationals. In this regard, it would be useful for health experts to popularise easy scientific equivalents and stay clear from such terms: A virus after all does not have a nationality but “2019 novel coronavirus” is a mouthful. Second, schools and community leaders should seek to build empathy for those infected around the world rather than allow people to be absorbed in hate towards Chinese nationals. We should consider how, if a similar virus had originated in Singapore, we would have felt had there been global disdain for all things Singaporean.   Third, individual responsibility for our words and deeds must also be taken. Netizens should offer support to those experiencing the crisis online and call out racist and discriminatory comments. As cases of local emissions emerged this week, members of Singapore society must keep in mind they have a role to play in stemming xenophobic sentiments. A harmonious and informed society is much needed to weather not only this health threat but also the other aspects of the novel coronavirus challenge that can have significant implications for Singapore.

06 Feb 2020 11:49AM,Workers making iPhones in central China plant to be quarantined over coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TAIPEI: Workers making iPhones at tech giant Foxconn's plant in central China will be quarantined for up to two weeks, the company said on Thursday (Feb 6), as cities on the mainland tighten their defences against the deadly coronavirus outbreak. Also known by its official name Hon Hai Precision Industry, Foxconn is the world's biggest contract electronics maker and assembles Apple's iPhones as well as gadgets for other international brands. Foxconn's vast network of factories in China, including one of its largest in Zhengzhou in central Henan province, is set to resume operations on Feb 10 after an extended Chinese New Year holiday caused by the outbreak. But the company said it has advised instate and out-of-state employees at the Zhengzhou plant to be quarantined for seven and 14 days, respectively, in accordance with local government policies. China's industrial base has been buffeted by the outbreak of the virus, which began in the manufacturing hub of Wuhan in central China but has since spread to more than 20 countries. The number of confirmed infections has hit more than 28,000 in China while death toll passed 560 in an outbreak that has spiralled into a global health emergency. The virus is also set to have an impact on international supply chains and manufacturing given China's lynchpin role in the global economy. Foxconn now projects a sales increase of 1 to 3 per cent this year, down from a January forecast of 3 to 5 per cent, chairman Young Liu told Bloomberg News. Foxconn has tried to allay fears of production shortfalls, saying it had previous experience of viral outbreaks following the SARS epidemic in 2003. It is China's biggest private-sector employer, with more than a million people working in around 30 factories and research facilities, including one in Wuhan. Taiwan has reported 11 confirmed cases so far, mostly people returning from Wuhan. The government announced Thursday that all foreigners who resided or visited China, Hong Kong or Macau in the past 14 days will be temporarily barred from entering the island. Foreigners with residency permits in Taiwan returning from these areas must undergo a 14-day stay-home quarantine.

09 Feb 2020 07:09AM,China's coronavirus deaths surpass SARS as millions stagger back to work,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The number of confirmed infections in China's coronavirus outbreak has reached 37,198 nationwide with more than 2,600 new cases reported, the National Health Commission said on Sunday (Feb 9). In its daily update, the commission said there had been 89 new deaths from the virus - with 81 in hardest-hit Hubei province, and the rest in other regions - bringing the national toll to 811. The death toll is now higher than the global number of deaths caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, which killed 774 people in 2002-2003. Authorities had told businesses to tack up to 10 extra days onto holidays that had been due to finish at the end of January as the rising numbers of dead and infected cast a pall over the country. Many of China's usually teeming cities have almost become ghost towns during the past two weeks as Communist Party rulers ordered virtual lockdowns, cancelled flights, closed factories and shut schools. The sight of an economy regarded as a workshop to the world laid so low has taken a toll on international financial markets, as shares slumped and investors switched into safe-havens like gold, bonds and the Japanese yen. Even on Monday, a large number of workplaces and schools will remain closed and many white-collar employees will work from home. China has blocked a plan by Apple supplier Foxconn Technology to resume production in China from Monday, the Nikkei business daily reported. Gaming giant Tencent Holdings Ltd said on Sunday it had asked staff to continue working from home until Feb 21. Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, will keep schools shut until Mar 1, the People's Daily newspaper said. Several provinces have shut schools until the end of February. NEW DEATHS, DISMAY, MISTRUST An American hospitalised in the central city of Wuhan in Hubei province, where the outbreak began, became the first confirmed non-Chinese victim of the disease. The Washington Post identified him as Hong Ling, a 53-year old geneticist who studied rare diseases at Berkeley. A Japanese man who also died in Wuhan was another suspected victim. As millions of Chinese prepared to go back to work, the public dismay and mistrust of official numbers was evident on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. ""What's even more frustrating is that these are only the 'official' data,"" said one user. ""Don't say anything else. We all know we can't purchase masks anywhere, why are we still going back to work?"" said a second. ""More than 20,000 doctors and nurses around the country have been sent to Hubei, but why are the numbers still rising?"" asked a third. UNREPORTED CASES Among the latest deaths, 81 were in Hubei, where the virus has infected most people by far. New deaths in Wuhan, Hubei's capital, saw a rare decline. New infection cases on Saturday recorded the first drop since Feb 1, falling back below 3,000 to 2,656 cases. Of those, 2,147 cases were in Hubei. Total confirmed coronavirus cases in China stood at 37,198, commission data showed. Joseph Eisenberg, professor of epidemiology at the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan, said it was too early to say whether the epidemic was peaking. ""Even if reported cases might be peaking, we don't know what is happening with unreported cases,"" he said. ""This is especially an issue in some of the more rural areas."" The virus has spread to 27 countries and regions, according to a Reuters count based on official reports, infecting more than 330 people. Two deaths have been reported outside mainland China - in Hong Kong and the Philippines. Both victims were Chinese nationals. ALARM IN EUROPE, UNITED STATES AND ASIA Major cities and capitals announced new travel restrictions as concern over the spread of the virus increased. Hong Kong introduced a two-week quarantine on Saturday for all people arriving from the mainland, or who have been there during the previous 14 days. Malaysia expanded its ban on visitors from China. France issued a new travel advisory for its citizens, saying it did not recommend travelling to China unless there was an ""imperative"" reason. Italy asked children travelling from China to stay away from school for two weeks voluntarily. The latest patients outside China include five British nationals staying in the same chalet at a ski village in Haute-Savoie in the Alps, French health officials said, raising fears of further infections at a busy period in the ski season. Britain's final evacuation flight from Wuhan, landed at a Royal Air Force base in central England on Sunday with 200 people on board and a plane with 266 evacuees landed on Sunday in Darwin, Australia, SBS broadcaster said. Singapore also organised a second evacuation flight for 174 Singaporeans and their family members in Wuhan. The country has reported 40 cases of coronavirus, putting it among the hardest hit countries, along with Japan, outside of China. On Sunday, Singapore's central bank advised financial institutions to step up precautions for staff, after the Government raised its response to the virus on Friday to Orange. Organisers of the Singapore Airshow 2020 expect this week's event to draw less than half the crowd seen on public days at the last show in 2018.

04 Feb 2020 06:22AM,Commentary: We know more about the novel coronavirus but uncertainty remains about how virus spreads,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners The viral spread of anxiety and bigotry is as dangerous as the virus itself, says NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health’s Clarence Tam. SINGAPORE: In the past week, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the epidemic of the novel coronavirus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. This has previously been done for epidemics of swine (H1N1) influenza, polio, Zika and twice for epidemics of Ebola in west and central Africa. Classifying the current epidemic as an international emergency signifies the need for a concerted international effort to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. This decision has been precipitated by a number of factors, including the dramatic pace at which the epidemic is evolving, the detection of cases linked to international travel in an increasing number of countries, and the growing recognition of disease clusters outside of China that have resulted from person-to-person spread rather than travel to Hubei province. MANY KEY UNCERTAINTIES REMAIN But there is still uncertainty about some key issues – how widely the virus will spread outside China, what impact this will have, particularly in countries with fragile health systems, and exactly how severe this illness is. What we know so far is that the virus seems less deadly but more transmissible than SARS. Of the hospitalised cases detected in China, about 2 to 3 per cent have died compared to SARS’ 10 per cent fatality rate. Of these, most had underlying health conditions that are likely to have contributed to their risk of death. There is also increasing evidence that the virus can be passed on by people with mild or no symptoms. A new study by German researchers published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday (Jan 31) found a cluster of cases from China and Germany in which the virus appears to have spread before patients showed symptoms. All these cases were reported to have mild illness.   It is likely that a much larger pool of people have been infected but are not recorded in official statistics, because they do not experience pneumonia-like symptoms. One study published on prestigious medical journal The Lancet estimates than more than 75,800 have been infected in Wuhan alone, with the virus expected to reach its peak only in April or May. A more conservative estimate by China’s Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control estimates 25,000 infected but projects that the number of infections will double every six days. These uncertainties pose challenges for containing the epidemic, if people can pass on the virus to others before they know they are infected and before they can be isolated. For most healthy individuals, the risk of dying from a novel coronavirus infection is low, although we should be particularly concerned about those with pre-existing health conditions. Studies have shown that the first few cases saw a majority of those infected to be above 50. SARS had a fatality of 10 per cent but that jumped to 50 per cent in people over the age of 50, explained Vineet Menachery, an immunologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch said in an interview with Quartz, suggesting that seniors are more susceptible because of a weaker immune system. THE EXPLOSION OF CITIES MAY EXPLAIN JUMP FROM ANIMALS TO HUMANS As we work to resolve uncertainties about the biology of this new virus, it is important to remember epidemics have an important social dimension borne out of human development – which have little to do with peculiarities unique to China. Of the six epidemics that have been declared international emergencies, five involved viruses that ultimately originated in animals, including the current novel coronavirus.   Viruses routinely jump between species. In the past, these jumps were more likely to happen when humans and animals came into contact in remote areas. It was more difficult for these viruses to gain traction in humans, because there were fewer people to pass the virus on to. But as epidemics of SARS and Ebola have shown, with human migration and greater urbanisation, when these viruses are introduced into large, densely populated cities, they can spread rapidly and with devastating impact. This is bad news when there are about 600 cities with a population exceeding 1 million people today. But the astounding rise of China has seen urbanisation rates explode – 60 per cent of its population today live in urban areas and this figure is expected to rise to 70 per cent in the coming decade. Together with increased human encroachment into animal habitats and the intensification of food animal production, the emergence of animal viruses capable of causing similar international emergencies may become the new normal. The larger lesson to take away is this: If we are to successfully prevent and control the threat of such future epidemics, we urgently need global investments in urban planning, robust health systems and biosecurity. MEANWHILE BEWARE THE FEAR AND ANXIETY STOKED With the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus, we have also seen the viral spread of misinformation.   The upside of the potential for social media to facilitate rapid communication of scientific knowledge and health information emerging from this epidemic is being challenged by its use that fuels anxiety, fear and hatred. Conspiracy theories, malware, unfounded rumours and bigoted opinions have grown. Pictures of restaurant and store windows in South Korea and Japan with signs saying, “No Chinese allowed” have gone viral on Twitter and other social media platforms. Much of this incites social tension, distrust in governments, health authorities and scientific evidence, and demonstrates extreme and disturbing prejudices on the basis of nationality and ethnicity. As countries implement stricter travel restrictions and social distancing measures in an effort to curb epidemic spread, there is a real danger that as a society we may be aiding the spread of hatred and xenophobia. By the end of the epidemic, thousands of people will have been placed in isolation and quarantine and millions will have had their movements severely restricted through no fault of their own. The vast majority of these individuals will turn out to pose little or no threat to others, but are being asked or ordered to temporarily forfeit their freedoms for the good of the wider community. We should not look upon these individuals with fear, hatred and distrust, but rather with gratitude, kindness and compassion. In time, we will bring this epidemic under control and lessen its impact on humanity, but in doing so we must not lose sight of what it means to be human.

05 Feb 2020 01:43PM,Hong Kong medical staff strike for third day as locally transmitted coronavirus cases rise,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners HONG KONG: Medical workers in Hong Kong began a third day of strike action on Wednesday (Feb 5), piling pressure on the city's government to seal the border with mainland China as the number of locally transmitted cases of a new coronavirus increased. The former British colony saw its first death from the virus on Tuesday. It has confirmed 18 cases, including at least four that were transmitted locally, authorities said. ""As the disease is spreading rapidly in our community, and locally infected cases are steadily increasing, we are dangerously close to a massive community outbreak comparable to SARS,"" a newly formed union called the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance (HAEA) said in a statement. The coronavirus epidemic, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December, has rekindled memories in Hong Kong of a 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus that began in China and killed nearly 300 people in the city. The latest virus has spread rapidly in China with nearly 25,000 people infected and 490 deaths, most in Wuhan and the surrounding province of Hubei. Health workers and members of other trade unions in Hong Kong have demanded that the border with the mainland be completely sealed to block it. The city's chief executive, Carrie Lam, has suspended some links with the mainland and closed some border crossings but she has left three open, arguing that to close the entire border would be inappropriate, impractical and discriminatory. Thousands of medical staff have joined members of other trade unions this week and the city’s Hospital Authority has warned that emergency services are being severely hampered. Hong Kong’s beleaguered public hospital network was suffering from staff shortages and limited hospital beds before the coronavirus outbreak. On Wednesday, dozens of medical representatives including the chairwoman of HAEA, Winnie Yu, marched to government headquarters to press their demands for the border to be sealed. The health scare comes after months of at times violent protests in Hong Kong sparked by fears its autonomy, guaranteed under a ""one country, two systems"" formula, is being eroded by Beijing. Some protesters have come out in support of the HAEA strike with some demonstrations beginning to take on the characteristics of the protests. Overnight, police fired teargas and rubber bullets to disperse a crowd in the city's rural New Territories after protesters denounced the government's refusal to seal the border. On Wednesday, masked workers brandished posters reading ""Hospital workers on strike"" and ""If we burn, you burn too"" as they petitioned Lam to meet them and handed in a letter to her office on behalf of front-line medical staff. Separately, a cruise ship which had been denied entry to the southern Taiwanese port of Kaohsiung docked in Hong Kong, with all passengers and crew undergoing health checks, Cable TV reported.

03 Feb 2020 11:31AM,Chinese markets plunge US$420 billion as novel coronavirus death toll rises,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The death toll from a coronavirus epidemic in China rose to 361 and Chinese stock and commodity markets fell heavily on Monday (Feb 3) as investors retreated into safe-haven assets in the first trading session after an extended Chinese New Year break. Chinese stock and commodity markets wiped US$420 billion off China's stock market in their first session since Jan 23, when the outbreak of the newly identified virus had claimed only 17 lives in Wuhan city in Hubei province. By lunchtime, the benchmark Shanghai Composite index sat 8 per cent lower near an almost one-year trough, and was poised to post its worst day in more than four years. The yuan opened at its weakest level in 2020 and slid almost 1.2 per cent, past the symbolic 7-per-dollar level, as the falls soured the mood in markets throughout Asia. Shanghai-traded oil, iron ore, copper and soft commodities contracts all posted sharp drops, catching up with sliding global prices.   Investors were bracing for volatility when onshore trade in Chinese stocks, bonds, yuan and commodities resumed, following a steep global selldown on fears about the impact of the virus on the world's second-biggest economy. ""This will last for some time,"" said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING. ""It's uncertain whether factory workers, or how many of them, will return to their factories,"" she said. ""We haven't yet seen corporate earnings since the (spread of the) coronavirus. Restaurants and retailers may have very little sales."" More than 2,500 stocks fell by the daily limit of 10 per cent. The Shanghai Composite last sat at 2,734.7 and the onshore yuan at 7.0165 per dollar. Copper sank to its lowest in more than three years, falling by its daily limit of 7 per cent, while aluminium, zinc and lead shed more than 4 per cent and soybeans dropped 2 per cent. Bond prices, meanwhile, surged, with March futures contracts for 10-year bonds jumping 1.5 per cent. CLEAR MESSAGE Amid the selldown, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) injected 1.2 trillion yuan (US$173.81 billion) into money markets through reverse bond repurchase agreements. It also unexpectedly cut the interest rate on those short-term funding facilities by 10 basis points. China's securities regulator moved to limit short selling and urged mutual fund managers not to sell shares unless they face investor redemptions, sources told Reuters. ""It is a clear message that they want to take growth-supportive measures and keep the market reassured,"" said Mayank Mishra, macro strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore of the PBOC move. ""They are managing the situation well. The timing of the repo rate cut came a little quicker than some people were expecting, but they wanted to send a clear message."" Beijing has also said it would help firms that produce vital goods resume work as soon as possible, state broadcaster CCTV reported. Cities like Wuhan, where the virus originated, remain in virtual lockdown and China is facing mounting international isolation. Analysts are beginning to suspect the impact will be deeper than the hit delivered by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. ""Although most analysts agree it is too early to estimate the impact of (the virus) on the global economy, one thing I am increasingly more certain of is that the near-term shock to Chinese economy will be much higher than that in SARS period,"" said Tommy Xie, head of Greater China research at OCBC. ""The shock to Chinese manufacturing and industry sectors is likely to be unprecedented.""   Since then the flu-like virus has spread to more than two dozen other countries and regions, with the first death outside of China reported on Sunday, that of a 44-year-old Chinese man who died in the Philippines after travelling from Wuhan. The total number of deaths in China rose to 361 as of Sunday, up 57 from the previous day, the National Health Commission said. The number of new confirmed infections in China rose by 2,829, bringing the total to 17,205. While stock markets reopened, most provinces have extended the Chinese New Year holiday to try and contain the virus, with workers in Hubei not scheduled to return to work until after Feb 13.   At least another 171 cases have been reported in more than two dozen other countries and regions, including the United States, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong and Britain. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, but said global trade and travel restrictions are not needed. More than 250 people from 30 countries arrived in France on Sunday after being flown out of Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, in the latest evacuation of foreign nationals from the locked-down city. Australia evacuated 243 people, many children, from Wuhan on Monday and will quarantine them on a remote island in the Indian Ocean off its northwest coast.   Australia on Saturday followed the United States in barring entry to all foreign nationals travelling from mainland China. The Group of Seven leading industrialised democracies are trying to find a common approach for dealing with the fast-spreading new coronavirus, German Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Sunday. The virus is thought to have emerged late last year in a Wuhan market illegally trading wildlife. It can cause pneumonia and spreads between people in droplets from coughs and sneezes.   It has created alarm because it is spreading quickly and there are still important unknowns surrounding it, such as its death rate and whether it is able to spread before any symptoms show. The number of deaths in China from the new virus has now passed the total Chinese toll from the 2002-03 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus which emerged from China and killed more than 800 people around the world. Even so, Chinese data on the numbers of infections and deaths suggests the new coronavirus is less deadly than the SARS outbreak, although such numbers can evolve rapidly.

11 Feb 2020 02:13PM,NTU to log student attendance via QR codes to facilitate contact tracing for coronavirus outbreak if needed,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Students from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will have to log their attendance for lessons and co-curricular activities from Wednesday (Feb 12), to facilitate contact tracing if needed, in light of the novel coronavirus outbreak. Students must log their attendance by scanning a QR code on their smartphones, said the circular sent out on Tuesday morning, signed by deputy president and provost Professor Ling San. Location-specific QR codes will be placed at the entrance of lecture theatres, seminar and tutorial rooms, laboratories and meeting rooms on campus. Scanning them will lead students to an online form where they will be required to fill in their name and mobile number, wrote Prof Ling in the circular. All classes with more than 50 students will be “replaced by digital forms of learning”, and this applies to all tests, quizzes and face-to-face exams, said the circular. While classes with 50 or fewer students may continue, instructors can also choose to implement e-learning. The National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Singapore Management University (SMU) had earlier announced e-learning measures for classes above 50 students from Monday, as well as the cancellation or postponement of large-scale events. Similar to NUS and SMU, NTU will also require its students to take their temperature twice a day and declare it online. The university also acknowledged that students who are planning events on behalf of their schools, clubs and halls of residence have asked for advice on whether the events should continue. “The guideline is to limit student activities and events to 50 participants. Student organisers should discuss if these events should proceed having regard to the circumstances and keep within this limit,” wrote Prof Ling. For events involving non-NTU participants, organisers will have to get a QR code from NTU’s Office of Health, Safety and Emergency for participants to check in if the event venue does not have an existing QR code, or keep a registration list of participants with their contact details, he said. Temperature screening should be implemented for all participants and venues should be well ventilated with adequate hand-washing facilities, the circular read. Those who are feeling unwell or on leave of absence should not attend the event. “The university will continue to provide further updates and adopt additional precautionary measures, if necessary,” wrote Prof Ling. Singapore confirmed two more cases of the coronavirus on Monday. One is a Certis Cisco employee who served quarantine orders on two people from Wuhan and the other is a two-year-old girl who was one of the Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30. This brings the total number of cases in Singapore to 45, with seven in critical condition. Another seven have fully recovered from the virus and have since been discharged. The coronavirus epidemic has killed more than 1,000 people and infected more than 40,000, most of them in mainland China.

But, the government will look at ways to curb the spread of #nCoV2019 https://t.co/6AmgLlNE3K  Dr Wan Azizah, who is also National Disaster Management Agency (Nadma) chairman, said it aims to prevent locally transmitted cases. ""We don’t want to have any cases from Malaysians to Malaysians who have not travelled to China or have contact with Chinese nationals. Those are the sporadic cases that we are trying to curb,"" she said, adding that there was no need to impose a blanket travel ban for all Chinese nationals.

07 Feb 2020 02:10PM,Trump tells Xi he has 'confidence' in China battling coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump has expressed his ""confidence"" in China's ability to tackle the novel coronavirus epidemic during talks with his Beijing counterpart Xi Jinping. Trump ""expressed confidence in China's strength and resilience in confronting the challenge of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak"", the White House said in a statement on Friday (Feb 7). The viral outbreak, which is believed to have originated in central China late last year, has now infected at least 31,000 people and caused 636 deaths, mostly within China. ""The two leaders agreed to continue extensive communication and cooperation between both sides,"" said the White House following reports in Chinese state media that the two had spoken on the phone about the matter. According to China's state broadcaster CCTV, Xi also told Trump on the phone that China was ""fully confident and capable of defeating the epidemic"" and that ""the long-term trend of China's economic development for the better will not change"". Local governments across China have locked down cities of tens of millions of people in response to the crisis, while global panic has risen over the more than 240 cases that have emerged in two dozen countries. Xi's comments come hours after the death of a whistleblower doctor, punished for sharing information about the virus, prompted an immense outpouring of public grief and anger over how Chinese authorities have handled the crisis. Xi called the fight to contain the virus a ""people's war"" and told Trump that China has implemented ""nationwide mobilisation, comprehensive deployment and rapid response"" along with ""the strictest prevention and control measures"" against the virus. Xi also urged the US to act ""reasonably"" in response to the outbreak, the official Xinhua news agency said. Beijing has hit out against strict measures by other countries to contain the spread of the virus, calling travel bans against Chinese arrivals by a growing list of nations ""unkind"" and going against the advice of the World Health Organization. The US has temporarily barred entry to foreigners who have been in China within the past two weeks, joining countries including Italy, Singapore and Mongolia who have announced expansive restrictions on travellers from the virus-hit country. The United States, Japan, Britain, Germany and other nations have also advised their citizens not to travel to China.

12 Feb 2020 08:14AM,"Japan cruise ship coronavirus cases climb to 175, including quarantine officer","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TOKYO: Another 39 people have tested positive for the coronavirus on the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan as well as one quarantine officer, bringing the total to 175, the health ministry said on Wednesday (Feb 12). The Diamond Princess was placed in quarantine for two weeks upon arriving in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, on Feb 3, after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus. The epidemic originated in mainland China, where more than 1,100 people have now died of the virus. About 3,700 people are on board the ship, which usually has a crew of 1,100 and a passenger capacity of 2,670. Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said in parliament that he wanted to expand testing to all passengers and crew on board, and that authorities could muster resources to do more than 1,000 tests a day, according to national broadcaster NHK.  The ministry said tests were being conducted for others deemed to need them and it would announce the results later. The British-flagged Diamond Princess is managed by Princess Cruise Lines, one of the world's largest cruise lines and a unit of Carnival Corp. Kyodo news agency, citing the health ministry, said that of the 39 cases, 10 were crew and 29 were passengers. Ten were Japanese nationals and the others were from 11 countries, including the United States and China. Four were in serious condition, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said. People who test positive for the virus are taken off the ship to a hospital.   The quarantine officer who was infected had been handing out questionnaires checking the health of passengers and crew since Feb 3, and had been following rules that require the wearing of a mask and gloves but not a full protective suit, according to the Nikkei business daily, quoting the health ministry. ""It's terrible about the quarantine officer,"" one passenger on the ship, who declined to be identified, told Reuters. ""The ones who came to our room to do the initial screening had gloves and surgical masks, while the ones who came to do the actual virus test also had full gowns and full-face masks."" 'HIGH RISK' A health ministry official had no immediate comment, but Nikkei said the ministry was checking the officer's contacts with colleagues and family members. Mark Kortepeter, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, said that although it was hard to reach conclusions based on limited information, the ship infections pointed to an ""agent that is highly transmissible,"" at least in enclosed environments.   ""The infected quarantine officer probably indicates the high risk, even for individuals who are trying to protect themselves, because the virus is unforgiving and there is no room for error in use of personal protective equipment and hand hygiene,"" he said. ""A small number of virus particles is likely needed to infect, making it an efficient spreader."" The government was considering allowing elderly and those with chronic illnesses to disembark before the Feb 19 target date for the end of quarantine, some media reported, but added it would take time to determine where they could be sent. About 80 per cent of the passengers were aged 60 or over, with 215 in their 80s and 11 in the 90s, the English-language Japan Times newspaper reported. An improvement in life for people on the boat came several days ago with the announcement they can receive packages sent to the address of the pier - a service that Rob Thomson, a New Zealander living in northern Japan, whose parents are on the boat, made prompt use of. ""The one thing that they were missing were hot drinks during the day - they were getting coffee or tea at breakfast, but then during the day it was cold water or Coca-Cola or soft drinks ... and Dad was saying he'd like fresh fruit other than apples or oranges,"" he said, adding that he placed an order Tuesday night. ""So I tried sending some grapes and strawberries and stuff. And apparently the fresh things have already been delivered to somebody on the dock."" The foreign ministry released a notice on Wednesday urging its nationals to consider delaying trips to China and for Japanese in China to return home. Japan has sent four chartered flights to China's Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, for its citizens there to return, and plans a fifth. The people who returned on the first flight will be released on Wednesday if they test negative for the virus, media said.

12 Feb 2020 12:00PM,Hotpot restaurants fall victim to coronavirus fears in Hong Kong,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners HONG KONG: Hotpot has become the latest casualty of the coronavirus outbreak after 10 members of a family in Hong Kong became infected after sharing the dish, a much-loved favourite during winter. A hotpot - also known as a steamboat - is a bubbling cauldron of stock shared communally, to which diners add ingredients like meat, seafood and vegetables. But health experts have sounded warnings after a cluster of coronavirus cases were discovered in one Hong Kong family who all shared a hotpot with a carrier from mainland China over the Chinese New Year holiday. As the 10th positive case was confirmed within the family on Monday, stocks for large hotpot companies with restaurants in Hong Kong and mainland China plunged.   Xiabuxiabu closed down 7.1 per cent, Haidilao ended 4.8 per cent lower while Yihai International, which makes seasonings and sauces for hot pot, dropped 2.7 per cent. In Hong Kong, major restaurant chains including Fairwood, Cafe de Coral, Yoshinoya and Maxim's announced they were temporarily pulling hotpot from their menus. Maxim's also confirmed that two of the infected family members from the hotpot cluster worked in two of their branches, which would be closed for disinfecting.   Haidilao, China's largest hotpot chain, has already closed all its branches on the mainland, where the virus outbreak has killed more than 1,000 people. It said it will not close its Hong Kong branches but will start checking the temperatures of patrons. Sam Wong, who owns 66 Hotpot, a family-run restaurant in the bustling district of Mongkok, said around 20 customers have cancelled bookings since the news of the family cluster emerged. ""I don't think the focus should be placed specifically on hotpot considering the habit among Chinese people of communally sharing food,"" Wong, 39, told AFP. ""But given hotpot is part of this cluster infection case, our business can't help but be affected,"" he added.   Wong said he was conducting thermometer checks on all customers, had placed disinfectant-soaked floor mats at his restaurant entrance and was replacing reusable chopsticks with disposable ones. Emily Mok, a flight attendant, came to Wong's restaurant before it opened on Monday evening and ordered a hotpot for take-away. ""My boyfriend and I will have hotpot at home because we don't want to consume it in a restaurant, where we don't know who is sitting next to us,"" she said. Even before this year's health crisis, Hong Kong's catering industry had been battered by months of political unrest as Hong Kongers push for greater democratic freedoms and police accountability. In the last quarter of 2019, when the protests were at their most violent, the catering industry suffered a 14 per cent drop compared to the same period last year, according to government figures. Retail, tourism, and entertainment industries have been similarly hit. Wong's restaurant had weathered the unrest because he was a well-known pro-democracy supporter. With protesters keen to support the businesses, Wong said he almost always had queues outside. ""Now you can simply walk in,"" he lamented.

03 Feb 2020 01:46PM,"Fearing novel coronavirus, Hong Kong residents stock up on food, essentials","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners HONG KONG: Panic-stricken residents have emptied shelves in major supermarkets in Hong Kong, stockpiling meat, rice, cleaning products and soap as fears escalate over a coronavirus epidemic on the mainland. The rush to procure food in the city of 7.4 million people is unprecedented, residents say, describing it as far worse than the panic during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that killed nearly 800 people around the world, including nearly 300 in Hong Kong. The new coronavirus originated in central China's Hubei province and has so far killed 361 people in the country. Over the weekend in Hong Kong, hundreds of people queued for hours to buy masks and immune-boosting products such as vitamin C.   At a major supermarket in the bustling Wan Chai district, counters selling chilled meat and seafood were empty by mid-morning on Friday and over the weekend, with stocks of fresh vegetables dwindling. ""Everybody is really worried. I think everyone is afraid of what is going to happen in the next few days. Prices are also going to rise,"" said Cindy, a retail executive who was buying dry food and soap. Dozens of mask-wearing shoppers pushed trolleys down empty aisles showing sold-out signs for hand wash and antiseptic liquids. Others tried to stock up on remaining bags of rice and packaged noodles. The rush to buy food and cleaning products comes as some shoppers said they were concerned that a potential shutdown of the border would impact the supply of products.     Around 90 per cent of the city's total food supply is imported, with the bulk coming from the mainland, according to official data. The Hong Kong government has closed some border crossings, including the high-speed rail, but has stopped short of a complete shutdown, despite growing calls from medical workers, who plan a strike on Monday to demand action. The government is grappling with how to handle spreading infections locally, with 15 confirmed cases in the city. Calls have grown for the government to close the border with mainland China to minimise the risk of infection. Hong Kong's economy was badly hit during the SARS epidemic with tourism and services sectors the most affected as visitor arrivals tumbled and unemployment spiralled.

03 Feb 2020 06:05PM,Commentary: How effective are mass quarantines in China in curbing the spread of the novel coronavirus?,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Mass quarantines may allay public fear and provide the illusion of intervention, but they cannot be considered an evidence-based practice, says an expert. LONDON: The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. China has recorded over 17,200 cases, but under 400 deaths from the disease. As far as emerging diseases go, this virus appears relatively insipid. Despite the mild severity of this disease, over 50 million people in Hubei Province have been restricted to their region as Chinese authorities try to prevent the spread of the virus. Wuhan’s public health authorities say they are in a “state of war” and public transport has been shut down in several Chinese cities. Cordoning off ground zero is not unusual in public health emergencies. An outbreak of norovirus or salmonella may lead to restaurant closure. In the case of the novel coronavirus, the wet market from where it may have originated (in Wuhan) was similarly shut down. Removing the suspected source of the disease is necessary but not sufficient. Any public health response to a disease outbreak must prevent transmission of cases to others. And while isolation is a well-established practice for individual cases, quarantining millions of healthy people is unprecedented in public health. Across Asia, facemasks are back in vogue, with Alibaba selling 80 million over two days alone. Given the historical context, this is unsurprising. The Chinese are well acquainted with outbreaks of viral disease. Crystalline memories of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have re-emerged. But it is this very context that raises the question: Is such a drastic response warranted? ILLUSION OF INTERVENTION   Some, looking in from the outside, may welcome mass quarantine. But in reality, it is no better than the usual public health response of isolating cases and potentially high-risk contacts of cases. Going further to isolate those who have any theoretical risk of disease may allay public fear and provide the illusion of intervention, but it cannot be considered an evidence-based practice. First, the argument for mass quarantine rests on the perilous assumption that one person’s risk of infection is the same as another’s, simply because they live in the same region. We know this is not the case, particularly at an early stage in an outbreak, and that there are groups at higher risk who may be identified and targeted first before radical strategies that interfere with usual activities are considered. In fact, any impediment to the day-to-day functions of healthcare and other infrastructure can be a huge problem for disease control. Contact tracing, disease surveillance, public education and administering protective equipment, drugs or vaccines, rely on effective communication with hospitals, primary care, laboratories and other institutions, such as schools or nursing homes. Descending into a zombie-apocalypse scenario does not help in the operational coordination of complex cross-agency public health activities. Second, a Chinese public health response must protect those within the affected region as well as those outside it. The current position ignores the rights of healthy people in and around Wuhan.   If we assume all currently recorded cases are within the city of Wuhan (of approximately 11 million) and not the wider region, then we can conservatively estimate that over 99 per cent of people are not cases. While human-to-human transmission appears to be occurring, preliminary reports don’t suggest that this is a particularly infectious disease. For every one case, the WHO estimates that a further 1.4 to 2.5 (or an average of two) more people are infected. To put this in perspective, for measles, an estimated 12 to 18 people will get infected from a single case. So the vast majority of the population trapped in the region are not unwell and would be unlikely to get infected with an appropriate public health response. Such a geographical lockdown of this magnitude is not just superfluous but also introduces new health problems into the mix. The first week of quarantine has resulted in crowded hospitals, food shortages and the local economy grinding to a standstill. Amid such chaos, even the Chinese will struggle to prevent defectors from fleeing. Also, it is unclear when it would be possible to lift such a lockdown. HIGH PRICE TO PAY With cases increasing by the day, the quarantine looks like it is here to stay, but escalating economic and social pressures will loom large for decision-makers. Surely the billions the quarantine is costing the Chinese economy would be put to better use in developing new diagnostic, preventative or therapeutic technologies for the virus? A quarantine of this scale may create more problems than it solves. Other countries must be careful not to hastily imitate this if and when given the opportunity.

01 Feb 2020 04:45PM,Wuhan coronavirus silences Macau's bustling casinos,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners MACAU: Macau is usually bustling with gamblers during the Chinese New Year holiday but the flood of tourists has been reduced to a trickle this year as fears grow over a coronavirus that has killed almost 260 people. The number of visitors to the world's largest casino hub has plunged nearly 80 per cent in the past week, transforming the city into a shadow of its former self. As the only place in China that allows gambling, the former Portuguese colony is normally a huge draw for people from other parts of the vast country. But on the sixth day of the holiday, only several dozen people were seen at the usually teeming ruins of the 17th-century St Paul's church - a tourist hotspot.   Most wore surgical masks as a preventative measure against the novel coronavirus, which has infected almost 12,000 people across the nation. ""Everyone is wearing a mask. It is not convenient to take pictures - we dare not remove the masks,"" 23-year-old Wei I Ting, a tourist from Taiwan, told AFP. Shotah Zhang, who owns a pastry shop, said he was worried about the future of his business. ""As you can see, almost no one is here. We have quite a big problem because we are a small business,"" Zhang said.   The outbreak is dealing a heavy blow to Macau's economy, which has bet most of its chips on gambling and tourism. Figures for January show gaming revenue fell 11.3 per cent on the same month last year. The city had confirmed seven cases of the virus as of Saturday and authorities have announced measures to curb its spread, including temperature checks and mandatory health declarations for visitors at the border with mainland China. In casinos, all staff have been ordered to wear masks and temperature checks are being carried out at entrances. The government has also banned anyone who has visited Hubei province - the epicentre of the outbreak - from entering casinos altogether. But a 24-year-old marketing supervisor for a coffee shop was more hopeful. ""We believe that after the virus is gone, customers will come back,"" she said.

03 Feb 2020 06:21AM,Commentary: Tourism in Asia takes a beating after Wuhan coronavirus outbreak,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners The timing could not be worse. The coronavirus outbreak occurring during the Chinese Lunar New Year, one of the biggest travel seasons in Asia, says Lisa Wan. HONG KONG: The novel coronavirus outbreak has killed hundreds and infected more than 14,000 in China within the last two months. At least 15 cities in China are locked down, accounting for a population of over 50 million people. Given the virus continues to spread worldwide, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on Friday (Jan 31). More countries, including the US, UK, and Canada, have warned against nonessential travel to China as well as established travel restrictions to tourists Among many, Singapore has also blocked the entry of tourists who had visited Hubei province in the past 14 days, or who hold passports issued in the province, and just these past few days, widened these restrictions to all visitors with recent travel history to China. Malaysia has also stopped issuing visas to Chinese travellers from Hubei. KEY TOURISM MARKETS AFFECTED The tourism industry – which include hotels, airlines, casinos and restaurants - is expected to suffer massively during the outbreak. For example, officials in Thailand estimate potential lost revenue at 50 billion baht (US$1.6 billion) around Lunar New Year this year.   The timing could not be worse. The coronavirus outbreak occurring during the Chinese Lunar New Year, one of the biggest travel seasons in Asia, when hundreds of millions of Chinese return to homes or take holidays, both domestically and internationally. The tourism industries in China and key countries that rely on Chinese tourists will suffer the most immediate repercussions. According to the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute, 6.3 million Chinese tourists travel abroad during the 2019 Lunar New Year holiday, generating travel revenue of around 513.9 billion yuan (US$73 billion). Before the outbreak, the Institute predicted 7 million Chinese tourists would travel abroad during the Lunar New Year this year. Hong Kong, Thailand and Japan are top favourite travel destinations. Chinese visitors make up the largest source market of Hong Kong, accounting for around 78 per cent (around 44 million) of the total number of visitor arrivals in Hong Kong for the entire 2019 (of 56 million). On the one hand, Hong Kong’s appeal to Chinese tourists has already been weakened by months of political protests, with inbound tourism already down 56 per cent from a year earlier. But with the coronavirus outbreak, Hong Kong has now suspended flights and train services to Wuhan and cancelled all Lunar New Year celebrations. The Hong Kong Marathon, originally scheduled for early February, had also been called off. Hong Kong airlines are cutting the number of their flights to the mainland by about half through the end of March in response to government virus-control efforts. All these additional virus-control policies will hit the Hong Kong tourism industry harder. The number of Chinese visitors to Japan has also exploded from around 450,000 in 2003 to 8.4 million in 2018, accounting for 27 per cent of all inbound tourists. Chinese tourists are also big spenders in many other cities, like London, Paris and New York. For example, China remains the fifth-largest source of foreign tourism to the US, behind Canada, Mexico, the UK and Japan. Around 3 million Chinese tourists also travelled to the US in 2018, spending more than US$36 billion.   The novel coronavirus has now infected more people in China than the SARS outbreak in 2003. The number of confirmed cases has jumped to more than 14,000, surpassing the 5,329 in China from SARS. According to the International Monetary Fund, China accounted for 4.3 per cent of world economic output in 2003, and this number jumped to 16.3 per cent last year. In other words, the novel coronavirus will affect the world economy more significantly when compared to the SARS outbreak. PRUDENT STRATEGY TO SCREEN ALL TRAVELLERS MORE THOROUGHLY That the novel coronavirus happened during the midst of the Chinese Lunar New Year period shows why tourism is one way in which the virus spread rather quickly. Aside from the imposition of travel restrictions on travellers from Hubei or China more largely, countries must screen all travellers from other countries just as thoroughly. The new coronavirus is able to transfer from one person to another, so crowded tourist attractions and closed spaces in planes definitely will speed up its spread. All but one reported death from the outbreak have so far occurred in China, but travellers have spread the virus to numerous other places. Cases have been confirmed in numerous countries including Australia, Cambodia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, the UK, the US and Vietnam.   One typical example is the first case of virus in Japan. The infected Japanese driver drove tour buses for Chinese groups from Wuhan in January, ferrying them from Osaka to Tokyo and back. He is believed to be the first case of the virus in Japan not linked to recent travel to China but was likely to have contracted the infection through while in confined spaces in the tour bus. A scientific paper published on Jan 14 in the Journal of Travel Medicine examined the potential for the international spread of the Wuhan coronavirus via commercial air travel. It identified the top 20 destination cities with regard to passengers arriving from Wuhan, using International Air Transport Association data from January to March 2018. Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei welcomed the most arrivals at 41,080, 23,707, 20,001, and 17,645 respectively. All have identified cases of the coronavirus, although several of Hong Kong’s cases are known to have entered the city via the high-speed railway rather than on a plane.

12 Feb 2020 01:34PM,Overworked and unprotected: Wuhan doctors in China's coronavirus epicentre risk infection,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: Doctors on the frontline of China's new coronavirus epidemic are facing a daunting task: Treat an ever-growing number of infected patients and risk getting infected themselves due to a drastic shortage of masks and other protective equipment. Tired and understaffed, medical workers have had to deal with thousands of new cases per week in Wuhan, the city at the epicentre of the outbreak that first emerged late last year. Many doctors have had to see patients without proper masks or protective body suits, resorting to reusing the same equipment when they should be changed regularly. Some have even worn diapers to avoid having to take off the equipment and make it last longer, according to a health official. One doctor at a community clinic in Wuhan said he and at least 16 other colleagues were showing symptoms similar to the new virus, including lung infections and coughing. ""As doctors, we do not want to work while being a source of infection,"" he told AFP, requesting anonymity for fear of reprisals. But ""right now, there is no one to replace you,"" the doctor explained, adding that all medical staff without a fever are expected to work. ""What would happen if there was no one working on the frontline?""  Some 44 per cent of the 42,600 cases nationwide - and the majority of more than 1,100 deaths - have been in Wuhan, home to a wild animal market where the virus is suspected of having originated before spreading between humans. The risks medical staff are facing was highlighted on Friday after Li Wenliang, a whistleblowing doctor in Wuhan, succumbed to the disease more than a month after he first raised alarm about a new SARS-like virus in the city.   His death unleashed an outpouring of grief and anger on Chinese social media, with 10 academics in Wuhan circulating an open letter calling for political reform and freedom of speech.   MASK DEFICIT The deputy mayor of Wuhan said on Friday the city faced a daily shortage of 56,000 N95 masks and 41,000 protective suits. Medical staff in protective suits will ""wear diapers, reduce how much water they drink, and reduce how many times they use the bathroom"", said Jiao Yahui, a top official at China's National Health Commission. Some of them will wear the same protective suit for six or even nine hours, when they should not be worn for more than four hours in a quarantined ward, she said last week. ""Of course, we don't advocate this method, but medical staff really have no alternative,"" she admitted.   The Chinese government has responded by mobilising the entire country to increase production of masks and suits. As of Monday, three-quarters of mask and suit producers had resumed work following an extended Chinese New Year holiday, said Cong Liang, an official at China's top economic planner. China has also imported more than 300 million masks and about 3.9 million articles of protective clothing since January 24, an official said last week. The Red Cross Society of China too has received over 900 million yuan (US$129 million) in donations for epidemic relief - though it has drawn scrutiny for its lack of transparency and efficiency. ""Even if we receive more masks, the number of patients increases even faster,"" said a doctor at a major Wuhan hospital, who requested anonymity because she was not authorised to speak with media.   Each doctor or nurse uses two to four masks each day, she explained. ""The consumption of masks in the hospital is enormous,"" she emphasised. ""They have a permanent lack of masks."" Doctors have also been forced to don makeshift hazmat suits, which are not adequate protection against the virus, said Xu Yuan, a 34-year-old in the US who donated US$5,000 in protective equipment to former classmates working at Wuhan hospitals. ""As soon as he put it on, (the suit) cracked because it was too small for him,"" she said, describing a friend in Wuhan - who was also forced to wear the same hazmat suit for five days. ""Everyday, he disinfects it after use,"" she told AFP. ""He said it may have been useless, but it is still better than nothing."" CALLS FOR HELP Handling the daily deluge of new cases takes another kind of toll too, said the doctor at the large hospital in Wuhan, whose colleagues are handling confirmed cases of virus patients. ""They are exhausted,"" she told AFP. One of her colleagues, for instance, works at a clinic that receives 400 patients within eight hours. Many are dealing with patients ""who die very quickly, whom they have not managed to save,"" she said. ""They have a lot of pressure,"" the doctor said, adding that her hospital had set up psychological monitoring. Many Wuhan residents are worried, too, said the doctor at the community clinic. He and his colleagues receive calls from distressed community members, he said - some of whom are too afraid to leave their homes. ""You can hear their calls for help, but your hands are tied,"" the doctor said, describing families where patients are stuck at home without medical treatment. ""There's nothing we can do.""

01 Feb 2020 06:01AM,FAQ: Wuhan coronavirus and its outbreak,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners CNA enlisted the help of medical experts to help answer some of your most asked questions. SINGAPORE: The coronavirus originating from China’s Wuhan city is spreading quickly in the country as well as across borders since it was first declared on the last day of 2019. Since then, the deadly pathogen has killed more than 200 people and infected nearly 10,000 in China alone. It has also reached more than 20 places across the world, with Hong Kong, Japan and Thailand among the highest counts of confirmed cases.  In Singapore, there have been 16 confirmed cases so far, all imported. CNA asked readers to submit questions on the coronavirus outbreak and had an overwhelming response. Questions ranged from how the virus is spread and whether it will affect pregnant women and their children.  To answer these, we enlisted the help of medical experts such as those from the Duke-NUS Medical School - Professor Gregory Gray, Assistant Professor Danielle Anderson and Professor Wang Linfa, who was also part of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) emergency committee looking into the virus outbreak - as well as Professor Benjamin Neuman, chair of Biological Sciences from Texas A&M University. Their lightly edited answers are as follows: Question: What is the difference between symptoms of Wuhan virus and flu/common cold? Prof Gray: They are very similar. Clinically, it is difficult to distinguish between the two; one really needs to use laboratory-based tests in order to do so. Prof Wang: Not much. Asst Prof Anderson: The symptoms of the flu and the Wuhan coronavirus are very similar and include fever, coughing and a runny nose.   Q: Can people recover naturally from the Wuhan coronavirus just like the common cold? Prof Gray: Yes. The vast majority will fully recover after their illness. Prof Wang: Yes, and the majority do. Asst Prof Anderson: Yes, people can recover naturally following infection and the majority of patients (98 per cent) do indeed recover. But while it is possible to recover from infection, some patients can develop severe disease and pneumonia. Q: How does the virus affect pregnant women and will it be transmitted to the unborn child? Prof Wang: It is not known yet. Prof Gray: Unknown, but pregnant women are often at increased risk of respiratory infections. Asst Prof Anderson: Currently there is not enough information available to determine if there is maternal transmission to the unborn child. A pregnant woman may develop more severe disease as they are immunocompromised and are more susceptible to complications of respiratory infections. Q: How should parents protect children under the age of 1 from the coronavirus? Prof Gray: Avoid having them come in contact with the public, especially people with respiratory signs and symptoms. Q: Can the virus be spread through water such as via swimming pools? Or through one’s eyes? Prof Gray: We don’t know, but other respiratory viruses can, such as adenovirus which is a hardier type of virus. Prof Wang: Transmission through the swimming pool is unlikely unless the person is swimming very close to an infected person. Yes, it is possible to be infected through the eyes. Asst Prof Anderson: It is unlikely that the coronavirus can be spread through water, especially chlorinated swimming pools. Coronaviruses are also not known to be spread though the eyes. There is an anecdotal case of infection through the eye and, if this infection did occur, it is an extremely rare event.   Q: How are those infected with the coronavirus being treated? What’s the success rate? Prof Wang: It is mostly just normal hospital care for severe cases. I have been told all confirmed cases (of the Wuhan coronavirus) are doing well in Singapore. There are drugs being tried in China, but it is too early to scientifically gauge their success rate. Asst Prof Anderson: If a patient has respiratory symptoms they may require breathing support. In milder cases, they can be given an intravenous drip to maintain blood pressure. Fluids can also be given in cases of diarrhoea, and ibuprofen or Panadol can be used for pain relief. Prof Gray: There is no specific treatment yet recognised as effective. Success rates are being determined now for supportive care. The mortality rate is low, less than 3 per cent, and likely will be lower as more people fully recover. (According to the WHO, global fatality rate for SARS patients was at 11 per cent) Q: Is the Wuhan coronavirus going to mutate further? Prof Gray: We don’t know, but the good news is that so far the 2019-nCoV virus is not changing. Prof Wang: All viruses mutate in nature. But so far, the Wuhan coronavirus seems to be quite stable. Q: Will tropical weather affect the spread of the virus? If yes, how? Prof Gray: Ultraviolet light can often kill respiratory viruses. Prof Wang: No scientific evidence for that yet. Q: How do you think this coronavirus outbreak will end? Prof Neuman: As a person who likes to make anti-viral drugs, things that actually slow down the virus, I can say that (better weather patterns or health measures) are probably not going to be the end (of the virus outbreak). And a vaccine will probably not going to be the end. It’s old-fashioned stuff like quarantines - basically keeping infected people away from healthy people that actually beat viruses like this. The risk is there are only so many quarantine facilities available in mainland China and only so many facilities to keep people properly treated while they are being treated for the virus. So if there are too many people that turn up sick, and overwhelm the systems that are there, that is potentially a risk.   We’ve seen China build new hospitals very quickly... so I believe they realise this possible risk and are trying to combat it - which is actually very good news. Q: Can you predict how long the virus will last? Prof Gray: I don’t expect to see a quick resolution. We are seeing the epidemic expand into other countries now. Prof Wang: No expert can do such a prediction as this is a highly complex matter. Even the experts at WHO are monitoring and assessing daily. However, the next two weeks will be critical when the Chinese New Year holiday ends in China. If we see a decrease in two to three weeks, I am hopeful we can control this. Asst Prof Anderson: It is difficult to predict when the peak of infection will occur. If the quarantine measures are effective and patients can be isolated for 14 days, the outbreak should end.

07 Feb 2020 03:30AM,It's too early to say coronavirus peaking in China: WHO,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners GENEVA: The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday (Feb 6) it was too early to say that China's coronavirus outbreak was peaking, but noted that the country had recorded its first day of a drop in the number of new infections. The death toll from the virus in mainland China jumped on Thursday to more than 630, with more than 30,000 confirmed infections inside the world's second-largest economy. That number had risen by nearly 4,000 from Wednesday to Thursday. Dr Mike Ryan, WHO's top emergencies expert, said it was very difficult to make predictions on the course of the disease first reported in the central city of Wuhan in late December, noting: ""We are still in the middle of an intense outbreak. ""There are cycles of transmission, and we may see those cases increase in the coming days. But at least for the moment, things are stable,"" Ryan told a news conference. ""But 4,000 cases or nearly, 3,700 coronavirus cases confirmed in a single day, is nothing to celebrate and is certainly still a great worry,"" he said. There is a constant rise in infections in the epicentre of Hubei province, which accounts for about 80 per cent of cases, Ryan said, adding: ""But we haven't seen that same acceleration in provinces outside Hubei. And equally we haven't seen that acceleration in Hong Kong, Macao, in Taiwanese people either."" Earlier, the United States and China clashed over the issue of Taiwan's exclusion from WHO meetings, including the ongoing executive board, where it is represented by China, with Beijing accusing Washington of political ""hype-up"". ""It's hard to believe just two months ago this virus was unknown to us,"" WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters. ""We have already learned so much about it, we know its DNA, we know it can be transmitted from one person to another, we know that those most at risk are older people and those with underlying health conditions,"" he said. But there is still a lot to learn, including the source of the virus, its severity and ability to spread, Tedros said. Maria van Kerkhove, a WHO epidemiologist, said that the virus causes a ""full spectrum of disease"". ""You have mild cases which look like the common cold, which have some respiratory symptoms - sore throat, runny nose, fever - all way through pneumonia. And there can be varying levels of pneumomia, all the way through multiple organ failure and death,"" she said, calling for further study of mild cases and how easily they can spread the virus.

04 Feb 2020 11:04PM,HIV drugs used to treat 'small number' of coronavirus patients: MOH chief health scientist,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: A ""small number"" of coronavirus patients in Singapore are being treated with HIV drugs, the Ministry of Health's (MOH) chief health scientist Tan Chorh Chuan said on Tuesday (Feb 4). ""In a small number of cases some of the HIV drugs Lopinavir and Ritonavir have been used here,"" said Prof Tan at a press conference. ""The trials are being done in China and other places, but they're being used here. We need to see the results of the trials to see how effective they are, but the results so far from other studies have looked quite promising."" He said the results of the clinical trials ""should be out, we hope, in the weeks ahead"". Doctors in Thailand, where there are more than two dozen cases, said on Sunday they have seen success in treating severe cases of the coronavirus with a combination of medications for flu and HIV. The Thai doctors said the treatment had improved the condition of several patients under their care, including a 70-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan. The treatment includes a mixture of the HIV drugs Lopinavir and Ritonavir, in combination with flu drug Oseltamivir in large doses, they added. Speaking to reporters after the press conference, Prof Tan said clinical trials would be “much easier” in a place with more patients, like Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. “We’re waiting to see how it proceeds and we hope in the weeks ahead we'll have some indication,"" Prof Tan said. “In the meantime, I mean, amongst the different drugs that have been tested in the past, these agents appear to be effective, but we can’t be certain at the moment. They appear promising. I think the trials will help us understand, whether or not, how effective it will be,” he added. Prof Tan noted that when the first case of the coronavirus was detected in Singapore, a diagnostic kit was ready due to the efforts of scientists and researchers in the background. “That’s because we’re able, really, to take the sequences that have been published, and to create rapid diagnostic kits, and to rapidly scale up the numbers so that we are able to diagnose the cases early,” he said. This is “quite different” from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, when there were no diagnostic kits for the first five weeks, which made containment efforts ""much more difficult"", Prof Tan added.   Singapore confirmed on Tuesday its first locally transmitted cases of the novel coronavirus, among six new cases of the virus. One patient was a tourist guide for a group of Chinese tourists, two work at a shop the group had visited, while a fourth case of local transmission was the domestic helper of one of the cases, said MOH at a briefing.

03 Feb 2020 10:37PM,MPs raise concerns over possible community spread of novel coronavirus and the economic impact on Singapore,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Members of Parliament (MPs) on Monday (Feb 3) lauded the Government's response to the novel coronavirus situation in Singapore, although some expressed their concerns about the possible community spread of the virus, the impact on Singapore’s economy and the availability of healthcare resources. In their ministerial statements, Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong and Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong stressed that every Singaporean will need to play their part to contain any possible outbreak. The two ministers, who co-chair the multi-ministerial task force formed in response to the virus outbreak, told Parliament that Singapore is preparing for various scenarios of how the global outbreak could evolve and acknowledged a possible community spread of the virus in Singapore. “Despite our best efforts, this is a possibility that we must be ready for,” said Mr Gan, adding that quick detection and limiting further spread will be key to managing this. “If the infected Singaporean wears a mask to protect others, and promptly sees a doctor and gets triaged for testing, the risk of further spread could be greatly reduced. Even if there is spread, quick action will help to limit its extent."" Once tested positive, the Government can also start tracing close contacts, which will help to reduce further spread of the coronavirus, said Mr Gan. “If the community spread becomes very extensive, we will need to consider measures to reduce human to human interactions, such as cancelling mass gatherings, suspending schools, paring down non-essential care services and introducing further infection control and monitoring measures, to slow the spread,” said the minister. About 20 MPs raised questions in response to the ministerial statements. MPs, including Mr Alex Yam and Ms Denise Phua, thanked the ministers for the updates, while Professor Fatimah Lateef applauded the Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Health for their “top notch” work. CONCERNS ABOUT COMMUNITY SPREAD Several MPs noted that there were concerns among Singaporeans about being infected by the coronavirus. MPs Lily Neo and Prof Fatimah raised questions about individuals who visit or are sent by employers to hospitals to be assessed if they are virus-free.   In an example raised by Prof Fatimah, air-con repairmen who had visited a suspected case's room were sent to the emergency department of a tertiary hospital to be assessed, even though they were asymptomatic. She said more public education was needed to prevent similar situations so as not to ""overload the hospitals"". When asked about employees who might ""seek certification"" on being virus-free so they can go back to work, Mr Gan stressed that there was no such certification. “We test the patient based on his viral load, and there is an incubation period during which the patient may have very low or zero viral load,"" the health minister said. “But at the same time, because (of the) incubation period, the virus may emerge later on and therefore, at any point in time when we test the person, when it is negative, it doesn’t mean that he is virus-free.” Mr Gan also encouraged employers not to send their workers to hospitals for such tests or certifications. “Please don’t go to the hospital to ask for a blood test in order to get a certificate that you are free from coronavirus. it’s just not possible for such certificates, and it just loads the hospitals unnecessarily,” he added. NO WORRIES LIVING NEXT TO QUARANTINE FACILITY Ms Phua said residents living near government quarantine facilities have expressed concerns about being near people who were asked to stay in such centres.   Mr Wong stressed that there is ""no need to fear"" living close to a government quarantine facility, or having someone subject to home quarantine within the same apartment block. “We have to be mindful that anyone who is in quarantine is not an infected person,” he added. There are also strict protocols and procedures that those who are under quarantine have to follow, such as ensuring they remain within the place of quarantine. There will be checks, including phone calls, video calls and spot checks, said Mr Wong. The minister noted that there have been several messages sent on Whatsapp listing places to avoid because an infected person might have been to those places. “Whenever there is a confirmed case, there is a thorough cleaning and disinfection process to make sure that the place is entirely clean and disinfected, with NEA (National Environment Agency) supervisors there,” Mr Wong added. LEAVE OF ABSENCE The announcement on Sunday that 30,000 work pass holders of Chinese nationality are currently overseas and will have to take leave of absence from their jobs when they return has also caused some anxiety to Singaporeans as the bulk of them live in HDB flats, said MP Lee Bee Wah. She also asked if there will be any way to ensure that those on leave of absence will comply with the conditions. The Manpower Ministry had said on Sunday that the number is less than 1 per cent of Singapore's workforce, but their absence will affect some sectors more than others.   Mr Wong clarified that the 30,000 work permit holders are still in China and have not returned to Singapore. “Not all of them live in our housing estates,” he added. The ministries are working directly with employers to identify them, which sectors they work in and where they stay, he said. “That exercise is underway now, so that we can be ready when these workers return - be ready to engage employers, be ready to engage their landlords,"" he added. “Some of them are living in dorms, be ready to ensure that dorms are properly fitted out, to have these workers living in more isolated areas without interaction and contamination with their fellow workers.” IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY Several MPs asked about the virus’ impact on the economy and whether the Government would introduce measures to help businesses and workers cope with the impact of self-isolation. In response to Mr Yam’s question on the scale of the coronavirus’ effect on the economy, Mr Wong said that Singapore is only “seeing the initial brunt” now. As the situation escalates, “impact will not only be for the sectors that are directly impacted like trade, transport and tourism, but there will be knock-on impacts”, he said. “We are studying this very carefully to develop a series of measures and a strong package in the Budget to help companies and workers. In the interim, wherever we can, we will develop and we will quickly roll out initiatives to help firms without having to wait for the Budget,” he said. Nominated MP Walter Theseira asked if the Government would encourage employers to be generous with paid medical and family leave for those who need to self-isolate or to look after family members. “I am not sure right now that paid leave is actually mandated for self-isolation … and we wouldn’t want employers to ask employees to take their own annual leave or no pay leave in such cases,” he said. Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said that employers can exercise flexibility when it comes to employees not on mandated leave of absence. Assoc Prof Theseira and Mr Ang Hin Kee also asked how the Government would support self-employed persons placed on a leave of absence. Mr Wong and Mrs Teo said that the Government was “mindful” of the feedback, and it was looking at measures to support and help self-employed persons. On Jan 28, Mr Wong announced that all Singaporeans and Permanent Residents (PRs) who are quarantined will receive S$100 a day. If employed, the employer will receive the allowance. If self-employed, the individual will receive the money. HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND RESOURCES Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked if there are enough healthcare workers in the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and hospitals to manage patients and whether these workers have sufficient rest and support. She also asked if the Government would activate volunteer healthcare workers.   “There is a heightened need for manpower because of the intensity that we are going through - inspection of, testing the cases, quarantining them and managing them … therefore we have been working with our clusters to ensure that they have sufficient manpower, and to make sure that their schedules are also properly looked at,” said Mr Gan. He added that he reminded hospital managers to plan for the long term and to ensure that doctors and healthcare workers get sufficient rest. “It is not a dash to the end point, because we need to be prepared that this may take months,” he said. He said he would consider recalling volunteers and those on leave. MP Melvin Yong asked Mr Gan if there were any measures to protect frontline medical staff looking after infected patients, in light of reports that medical workers in China have been infected with the coronavirus. Mr Gan noted that healthcare workers often get infected at the initial stages of the outbreak as they are unfamiliar with the virus and may not know that it is infectious. But Singapore has gone through “painful lessons” during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak and other disease outbreaks, and healthcare institutions now exercise ""extra caution"" to deal with infected patients, he said. These include NCID’s protocols on donning protective gear and general practitioners’ practice of giving potential patients masks to wear. The Government has also “ramped up” ambulance services to respond to the outbreak, said Mr Gan, responding to a question by Dr Neo on whether there is a shortage of ambulance services. ""In the initial first few days there were some organisation difficulties among the service operators, and we have sat down with them discussed with them and manage the logistics better now,"" Mr Gan said. ""I think that sometimes when there is a peak, it may take a while, a few minutes, and our part we try to respond as soon as possible."" He added that there is a hotline for doctors if they encounter any problems. CURE AND VACCINE NMP Mohamad Irshad asked if a cure might be developed for the virus, while Mr Christopher de Souza asked about Singapore’s global role in finding solutions to the crisis. Mr Gan said: “Currently, there is no curative treatment … I think vaccines and curative treatment are being looked into, but I think it will take time to develop the method, and to also test the treatment to make sure that it is effect and safe for patients.” He added that Singapore’s research institutions have been collaborating with other institutions around the world to better understand the virus and to develop a vaccine. The World Health Organization and international organisations have provided a platform to share knowledge and information, he said. MASKS AVAILABILITY AND PROFITEERING Following the announcement on Thursday that each Singapore household will be given four surgical face masks amid worries of low mask stocks, Workers’ Party MP Leon Perera asked for an update on profiteers selling masks at high prices, and whether the government would consider applying price controls under the Price Control Act. He also asked why Singaporeans were invited to collect the masks, instead of the masks being mailed to them. Adding that letters of demand have already been sent to e-commerce platforms like Lazada and Carousell, Mr Wong said: “We will not rule out any option at this stage. The price controller pursuing, investigating, getting more information, and if need be, more action can be taken. “But as of now, looking at the prices on some of these, platform providers have cooperated. I heard recently that some of them have even taken out or removed some of these listings with very exorbitant prices.” He also said that distributing masks by post could result in wastage, as some households might not need the masks. The minister noted that distribution of the masks is “proceeding in a very orderly fashion” with no queues or large crowds. NMP Irene Quay asked the Health Minister whether there will be measures in place to ensure the public is fitted with the right model of N95 masks, if they are required.   “In the event of widespread community transmission, wearing N95 masks is probably not the solution,” responded Mr Gan, adding that the masks are generally used by healthcare professionals. “We are most likely going to introduce social distancing, manage crowd gathering, minimising human-to-human interaction, rather than introduce N95 masks for general use. “I think to teach each of them how to wear N95 masks to be as effective as in the healthcare environment is quite difficult, and you may end up giving them a false sense of security, and as a result we end up with more infections, which is counter productive,” he said.

10 Feb 2020 10:11AM,"Malaysia confirms sixth citizen case of coronavirus, man worked in Macau before coming home unwell","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia announced its sixth citizen case of the novel coronavirus, a 31-year-old man who worked in Macau, on Monday (Feb 10). The man had travelled to mainland China before returning to Malaysia on Feb 1, said Malaysia's Health Director-General Noor Hisham Abdullah in a press statement. He felt unwell and began coughing on Feb 3, and visited a clinic on Feb 4 and Feb 6, during which he was given medication. When he was still sick on Feb 7, the patient sought treatment at a clinic and was referred to Banting Hospital in Selangor for tests and treatment, Dr Noor Hisham said. After he was isolated, he was diagnosed with pneumonia and was admitted. Further checks showed he was suffering from severe acute respiratory infection and was closely monitored. He was subsequently transferred to Sungai Buloh Hospital. A sample taken from the patient on Sunday tested positive for the novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV. The relevant authorities have been alerted to conduct contact tracing and other necessary preventive measures for this case, said Dr Noor Hisham. “I would like to advise the residents in Banting to keep calm. The Ministry of Health has taken the relevant steps and will update with the latest developments,” he added. As of Monday, there were 18 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in Malaysia, of whom 12 were Chinese nationals.

09 Feb 2020 02:30PM,Scientists race to develop vaccine for new coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Scientists from the United States to Australia are using new technology in an ambitious, multi-million-dollar drive to develop a vaccine in record time to tackle China's coronavirus outbreak. The new virus has spread rapidly since emerging late last year in China, killing more than 800 people in the mainland and infecting over 37,000. Cases have been reported in two dozen other countries. Coming up with any vaccine typically takes years, and involves a lengthy process of testing on animals, clinical trials on humans and regulatory approvals. But several teams of experts are racing to develop one quicker, backed by an international coalition that aims to combat emerging diseases, and Australian scientists hope theirs could be ready in six months. ""It is a high-pressure situation and there is a lot of weight on us,"" said senior researcher Keith Chappell, part of the group from Australia's University of Queensland. But the scientist added he took ""some solace"" knowing several teams around the world were engaged in the same mission. ""The hope is that one of these will be successful and can contain this outbreak,"" he said.   But even a timeframe of six months looks agonisingly slow with the virus, believed to have emerged from a market selling wild animals, killing close to 100 people every day in mainland China. Efforts are being led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a body established in 2017 to finance costly biotechnology research in the wake of an Ebola outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people. With a mission to speed up the development of vaccines, CEPI is pouring millions of dollars into four projects around the world and has put out a call for more proposals. ATTACK OF THE VIRUS The projects hope to use new technology to develop vaccines that can be tested in the near future. The body's CEO, Richard Hatchett, said the aim was to start clinical testing in just 16 weeks. German biopharmaceutical company CureVac and US-based Moderna Therapeutics are developing vaccines based on ""messenger RNA"" - instructions that tell the body to produce proteins - while Inovio, another American firm, is using DNA-based technology. DNA- and RNA-based vaccines use the genetic coding of the virus to trick the body's cells into producing proteins identical to those on the surface of the pathogen, explained Ooi Eng Eong, deputy director of the emerging infectious diseases programme at the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.   The immune system learns to recognise the proteins so that it is ready to find and attack the virus when it enters the body. The Australian researchers are using ""molecular clamp"" technology invented by the university's scientists that allows them to rapidly develop new vaccines based solely on a virus DNA sequence. French scientists at the Pasteur Institute are modifying the measles vaccine to work against the coronavirus, but do not expect it to be ready for about 20 months. Meanwhile, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has also started developing vaccines, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. RISKS VERSUS BENEFITS Health authorities weigh the risks and benefits in vaccine approvals and if there is a public health emergency, the process could be shortened, said Ooi of the Duke-NUS Medical School. But he added that ""paradoxically, if the situation improves, then actually the pathway for vaccines would be longer"". ""If there's a lot of these new coronavirus cases around, then you accept some risk, because of the tremendous amount of benefit you can derive, whereas if there are not many cases, the tolerance for risk would be very low."" While there is no vaccine for the coronavirus, some doctors are trying out a potent brew of anti-retroviral and flu drugs to treat those infected, but the science is inconclusive as to whether they are effective. Ultimately, scientists may end up in the same situation they were during the 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - it died out before a vaccine could be fully developed. A close cousin of the new coronavirus, SARS spread around the world and killed nearly 800. But Ong Siew Hwa, the director of Acumen Research Laboratories, a biotech company in Singapore, said efforts to develop a vaccine for the new virus should continue even if the outbreak ends. ""I think a vaccine will definitely be important,"" she said. ""If it's not in time for this round, it is important for the next time."" It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

31 Jan 2020 08:58PM,Myanmar sends back China plane after coronavirus scare,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners YANGON: Myanmar on Friday (Jan 31) sent a plane back to China with most passengers still on board - including French and American citizens - after one man suspected of contracting the coronavirus was taken to hospital. No cases of the pathogen that has killed 213 people in China have been reported in Myanmar so far but fears have been growing in the impoverished Southeast Asian nation that shares a border with its powerful neighbour. A total of 79 people were on board the China Southern Airline flight from Guangzhou, including two Americans, two French, two Myanmar, one Columbian and 72 Chinese nationals, according to airport officials. One Chinese passenger was taken to a nearby hospital after displaying possible symptoms of the virus, said civil aviation department manager Soe Paing. An AFP reporter saw health-workers wearing full protective gear greeting an airport ambulance. The two Myanmar nationals were also allowed to disembark and taken to the same hospital for checks, Soe Paing added. ""The rest of the people on the flight were sent back."" An airport police officer also confirmed the passengers' return. Despite a lack of confirmed cases in the country experts fear its fragile health system is in no way capable of coping with a serious outbreak. Myanmar is also waiting for permission to evacuate more than 60 students trapped in Wuhan since the city, the origin of the epidemic, was sealed off last week. Several countries have halted flights to China or tightened visa restrictions amid the virus scare and Myanmar has discussed adopting similar measures. Singapore announced Friday a sweeping ban on arrivals and transit passengers from mainland China hours after the World Health Organization declared a global emergency. The disease has so far spread to more than 20 nations and infected nearly 10,000 people though there have been no reported deaths outside of China.

01 Feb 2020 03:43PM,Wuhan coronavirus: Batik Air to evacuate Indonesians in Hubei,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners JAKARTA: A Batik Air flight departed from Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta International airport on Saturday (Feb 1) to Wuhan, China to evacuate 245 Indonesians who are trapped in Hubei province, the Indonesian government said. There are 245 Indonesians in Hubei, mostly in Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, and once they have returned they will be quarantined in the Natuna Islands. The Indonesians are all in good condition, foreign minister Retno Marsudi said. ""I've been communicating with them since last night and I've received reports that they are healthy and happy to return home,"" Mdm Marsudi said. Health minister Terawan Agus Putranto said that the Indonesians have been screened according to WHO protocols. ""We have already screened and cleared them. The ones we are going to carry back home are healthy Indonesians citizens,"" Mr Putranto said. A total of 250 Indonesians, including evacuation personnel, are expected to arrive in Indonesia on Sunday and they will then be quarantined in Natuna, military chief Hadi Tjahjanto said. ""The military supports the return (of the citizens) from Wuhan to Indonesia by providing facilities and infrastructure in accordance to health protocols. ""We have a place of isolation far from the population, and the best and chosen place is Natuna,"" military chief Hadi Tjahjanto said. He added that Natuna was chosen because it is a military base and is equipped with a hospital run by the military. ""So there are doctors from the army, navy, and air force. It also has a runway which is near to the isolation (quarantine) place,"" he added. The Batik Air flight is also carrying masks and surgical units to be handed to the government of China, Mdm Marsudi said. The move to evacuate the Indonesians comes after Mdm Marsudi said on Friday that China had cleared planes to fly to the virus-hit Chinese province of Hubei to evacuate Indonesian citizens from the area. More than 11,000 cases of the Wuhan coronavirus have been confirmed since it emerged late December in China. The virus has reached to more than 20 countries with more than 100 cases outside of China, but Indonesia has yet to report its first case. Indonesia has tested several individuals suspected of having contracted the coronavirus but as of Saturday all have been declared negative.

The patient is a 35-year-old Chinese woman who flew from Wuhan, China to Incheon international airport on Sunday. She was isolated upon entry into the country due to symptoms such as high fever, KCDC said in a statement. An outbreak of a new coronavirus in China has spread to more cities, Chinese authorities said on Monday, as the number of patients tripled and a third person died, stoking concerns about the containment of the virus. Officials confirmed the virus had been detected in Beijing and Guangdong province, marking the first instances of the illness spreading within the country beyond Wuhan, the city where the cases were first discovered. China, the World Health Organization and authorities across the globe are stepping up efforts to contain the virus, which initially emerged in Wuhan in late December as a wave of pneumonia patients. Three cases had previously been confirmed abroad - two in Thailand and one in Japan - involving people who recently visited Wuhan. The virus belongs in the same family of coronaviruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002-2003 outbreak that also started in China. Though some experts say the new virus may not be as deadly as SARS, there is still little known about it including its origin and how easily it can be transmitted between humans. Authorities in Hong Kong have stepped up detection measures, including rigorous temperature checkpoints for inbound travellers from the Chinese mainland. Airport authorities in Singapore, the United States as well as most Asian nations are also screening passengers from Wuhan. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

03 Feb 2020 11:31AM,Chinese markets plunge US$420 billion as novel coronavirus death toll rises,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The death toll from a coronavirus epidemic in China rose to 361 and Chinese stock and commodity markets fell heavily on Monday (Feb 3) as investors retreated into safe-haven assets in the first trading session after an extended Chinese New Year break. Chinese stock and commodity markets wiped US$420 billion off China's stock market in their first session since Jan 23, when the outbreak of the newly identified virus had claimed only 17 lives in Wuhan city in Hubei province. By lunchtime, the benchmark Shanghai Composite index sat 8 per cent lower near an almost one-year trough, and was poised to post its worst day in more than four years. The yuan opened at its weakest level in 2020 and slid almost 1.2 per cent, past the symbolic 7-per-dollar level, as the falls soured the mood in markets throughout Asia. Shanghai-traded oil, iron ore, copper and soft commodities contracts all posted sharp drops, catching up with sliding global prices.   Investors were bracing for volatility when onshore trade in Chinese stocks, bonds, yuan and commodities resumed, following a steep global selldown on fears about the impact of the virus on the world's second-biggest economy. ""This will last for some time,"" said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING. ""It's uncertain whether factory workers, or how many of them, will return to their factories,"" she said. ""We haven't yet seen corporate earnings since the (spread of the) coronavirus. Restaurants and retailers may have very little sales."" More than 2,500 stocks fell by the daily limit of 10 per cent. The Shanghai Composite last sat at 2,734.7 and the onshore yuan at 7.0165 per dollar. Copper sank to its lowest in more than three years, falling by its daily limit of 7 per cent, while aluminium, zinc and lead shed more than 4 per cent and soybeans dropped 2 per cent. Bond prices, meanwhile, surged, with March futures contracts for 10-year bonds jumping 1.5 per cent. CLEAR MESSAGE Amid the selldown, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) injected 1.2 trillion yuan (US$173.81 billion) into money markets through reverse bond repurchase agreements. It also unexpectedly cut the interest rate on those short-term funding facilities by 10 basis points. China's securities regulator moved to limit short selling and urged mutual fund managers not to sell shares unless they face investor redemptions, sources told Reuters. ""It is a clear message that they want to take growth-supportive measures and keep the market reassured,"" said Mayank Mishra, macro strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore of the PBOC move. ""They are managing the situation well. The timing of the repo rate cut came a little quicker than some people were expecting, but they wanted to send a clear message."" Beijing has also said it would help firms that produce vital goods resume work as soon as possible, state broadcaster CCTV reported. Cities like Wuhan, where the virus originated, remain in virtual lockdown and China is facing mounting international isolation. Analysts are beginning to suspect the impact will be deeper than the hit delivered by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. ""Although most analysts agree it is too early to estimate the impact of (the virus) on the global economy, one thing I am increasingly more certain of is that the near-term shock to Chinese economy will be much higher than that in SARS period,"" said Tommy Xie, head of Greater China research at OCBC. ""The shock to Chinese manufacturing and industry sectors is likely to be unprecedented.""   Since then the flu-like virus has spread to more than two dozen other countries and regions, with the first death outside of China reported on Sunday, that of a 44-year-old Chinese man who died in the Philippines after travelling from Wuhan. The total number of deaths in China rose to 361 as of Sunday, up 57 from the previous day, the National Health Commission said. The number of new confirmed infections in China rose by 2,829, bringing the total to 17,205. While stock markets reopened, most provinces have extended the Chinese New Year holiday to try and contain the virus, with workers in Hubei not scheduled to return to work until after Feb 13.   At least another 171 cases have been reported in more than two dozen other countries and regions, including the United States, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong and Britain. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, but said global trade and travel restrictions are not needed. More than 250 people from 30 countries arrived in France on Sunday after being flown out of Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, in the latest evacuation of foreign nationals from the locked-down city. Australia evacuated 243 people, many children, from Wuhan on Monday and will quarantine them on a remote island in the Indian Ocean off its northwest coast.   Australia on Saturday followed the United States in barring entry to all foreign nationals travelling from mainland China. The Group of Seven leading industrialised democracies are trying to find a common approach for dealing with the fast-spreading new coronavirus, German Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Sunday. The virus is thought to have emerged late last year in a Wuhan market illegally trading wildlife. It can cause pneumonia and spreads between people in droplets from coughs and sneezes.   It has created alarm because it is spreading quickly and there are still important unknowns surrounding it, such as its death rate and whether it is able to spread before any symptoms show. The number of deaths in China from the new virus has now passed the total Chinese toll from the 2002-03 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus which emerged from China and killed more than 800 people around the world. Even so, Chinese data on the numbers of infections and deaths suggests the new coronavirus is less deadly than the SARS outbreak, although such numbers can evolve rapidly.

05 Feb 2020 06:32AM,Commentary: Hot and humid weather may end the novel coronavirus – as well as the development of a vaccine,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Cases may fall sharply by May, when temperatures in China warm up, say Dr Jyoti Somani and Professor Paul Tambyah. SINGAPORE: The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that infected more people in China than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 has now spread across the globe. While we are learning more about the virus daily, questions are being raised about its rapid spread. One possibility is that this development could be related to climatic conditions. CLIMATE, WEATHER AND FLU SEASONALITY There is reason to believe that the seasonal pattern of novel coronavirus pneumonia may be similar to that of influenza infection and SARS, and thus cases may sharply fall by May, when temperatures in China warm up. In countries with temperate climates such as China and the United States, the flu season usually starts in December with a peak in January or February, after which cases decrease. SARS disappeared in the northern summer of 2003 and has not reappeared significantly since. This seasonality of influenza and other respiratory viruses in temperate countries is thought to be related to factors that affect infectiousness (person to person spread) such as the dryness of the air, ambient air temperature and possibly ultraviolet solar radiation. Human factors may also contribute to the spread of influenza during the colder winters since more time may be spent indoors, presumably in closer contact with other persons. The 2019-nCoV appears to be similar to other respiratory viruses such as influenza or the common cold (rhinovirus), which are spread by large droplets of saliva or phlegm from one person to another (either directly by cough or sneeze) or by contact. That happens when a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches his or her nose, mouth or eyes, inadvertently transmitting the virus. In fact, studies have shown that these respiratory droplets spread farther when the air is cold and dry. Studies done many years ago showed that the “regular” coronavirus (which is one of the causes of the common cold) can survive on surfaces 30 times longer in places with a temperature of 6 degrees Celsius compared to those where the temperature is 20 degrees Celsius and humidity levels are high. More recently, scientists from Hong Kong University (HKU) including Professor Malik Peiris and Professor Seto Wing Hong showed that low temperatures and low relative humidity allowed the SARS virus to survive much longer than they would in high temperatures and humidity.   The HKU team argued that this may be the reason warm and humid Southeast Asian countries did not have SARS outbreaks, unlike Hong Kong and Singapore where in their words, there is “intensive use of air-conditioning”. Thus, just as with influenza, the 2019-nCoV may slow down when the sun starts to shine more and the weather warms up in temperate and subtropical countries. LESSONS FROM SARS The SARS epidemic occurred 17 years ago and, since then, public health institutions, medical and laboratory science professionals, and the infectious diseases community are much better prepared to respond to novel and emerging infections globally. The improvements in communications and social media are undeniable. The genetic sequence of this new type of severe pneumonia in Wuhan was shared relatively early. This allowed countries all over the world to develop fast and accurate tests: These were not available during the initial weeks of SARS outbreak. Then, we had to depend on clinical examinations and contact tracing to determine who really was infected with SARS. Near the end of the epidemic, we were able to test everyone and we found out that we had actually missed a significant number of cases – these were only diagnosed after they had recovered. This has been the biggest difference in that now, low-resourced countries like Nepal and Cambodia are able to conduct relatively fast and accurate diagnosis on-site without having to wait for samples to be sent overseas. Given that the genetic information about the novel coronavirus was available even before countries had patients with the virus, many labs in advanced countries, including Singapore, are already working on blood tests for rapid detection and studying the immune response to help vaccine development. A trial to test anti-viral treatments has already been initiated in China and is being planned elsewhere. CONTACT TRACING AND TRAVEL BANS A basic public health approach to any outbreak is the use of contact tracing.   This means that for any patient who is found to be ill, close family members and other persons that he or she had close contact with during the incubation period will be notified that they were exposed to a sick person and quarantined for a further full incubation period, which for this novel infection is indicated to be 14 days. During the Ebola virus outbreak of 2014, this type of contact tracing was done very manually in many settings, although there were a number of mobile applications which were piloted. For this 2019 virus infection outbreak, much effort is being placed on high-tech contact tracing. It is too early to tell if this will be more effective, but any method to help contacts monitor themselves during the incubation period and detect symptoms may certainly help to decrease community transmission. Public health measures including screening and quarantining are similar to what was done for SARS and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), although there have been broader approaches to travellers without direct contact with infected patients because of the extent of community spread in China. Given that we are not sure as to what extent asymptomatic persons can transmit the virus, many countries have decided to close their borders to Chinese nationals, as they cannot rely on temperature screening to detect who is potentially contagious and necessitating quarantine. Many countries are also quarantining their own citizens and permanent residents returning from China, in an effort to limit introduction of this virus into the community. During SARS, the World Health Organization (WHO) imposed global travel restrictions and advisories. When a travel restriction is in effect, a country may feel the need to quickly get the ban lifted and reduce its aggressive screening and case finding. This may have contributed to the resurgence of SARS in Toronto after the initial period of good control. This time round, different countries have introduced their own travel restrictions which are probably more appropriate to the different situations and their relations with China. Travel bans are always controversial as they tend to have significant unintended consequences and have to be actually instituted before the virus appears in the country. Otherwise, they are relatively pointless. Among the concerns about the travel bans instituted this time during the coronavirus is the fact that we do not know how extensive the spread is from people without symptoms.   If this is really very widespread, then a blanket travel ban will have limited effects by now as the virus is probably silently spreading among and through most countries. Once there is documented local transmission in a country, as in Germany and the United States, the goal has to be containing the local transmission while at the same time preventing re-introduction of the virus. Overall, the key strategy has to be good contact tracing and widespread testing so that every case can be identified, tested and treated. That way the chain of transmission can be broken and the virus stopped in its tracks even before the warm weather kicks in. VACCINES AND DRUG TREATMENTS Unfortunately, the current way in which drug and vaccine development in modern medicine happens is very much driven by financial considerations. Unlike for example defence or homeland security, the question that always comes up when it comes to treating and preventing human disease is: “Is this financially viable?” As SARS disappeared 17 years ago and MERS has only occurred sporadically, primarily in the Middle East, there has been no incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to invest the funds needed to develop appropriate drugs and vaccines. All the interest and enthusiasm which came with SARS disappeared when the virus did not reappear after a couple of seasons. Governments had other priorities and most have actually left this part of national security to private industry. Hence, if and when the novel coronavirus disappears in May and does not reappear next October or November, we can predict that drug and vaccine development will likely die a natural death. That is unfortunately the way of the world and hopefully something can be done to change this. But that will require a massive global mindset change. Given the frequency with which these emerging viral infections occur, the world can ill- afford to continue along this road.

07 Feb 2020 03:21PM,Four overseas cases of novel coronavirus linked to Singapore: Here’s what we know,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: As countries around the world report more cases of coronavirus and try to establish the source of each infection, attention has turned to an international business conference at Singapore's Grand Hyatt hotel last month. Malaysia and South Korea have as of Friday (Feb 7) confirmed three cases of the novel coronavirus linked to that conference. The UK also has one patient with the virus who had travelled to Singapore, although no link to the conference has been reported. The authorities in Singapore have not revealed which company organised the conference, but it has been reported that it was an event by Servomex, which describes itself as a ""provider of reliable, accurate and stable gas measurements"". A source has also told CNA that the event was organised by the company, which was founded in the UK and has worldwide offices. CNA contacted Servomex's office in Singapore for comment, but the company did not respond. There were over 31,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus worldwide as of Friday morning. There have been two deaths reported outside of mainland China so far, one in the Philippines and one in Hong Kong. This is what we know about the four international cases linked to Singapore: MALAYSIA WHO: A 42-year-old man from Selangor was the first Malaysian citizen to contract the novel coronavirus. DETAILS: Singapore's Health Ministry said on Tuesday that the man had been in Singapore from Jan 16 to Jan 23 for the business meeting, which also had Chinese nationals in attendance. The Malaysian developed symptoms a week after returning to Malaysia, and tested positive for the virus on Feb 3. Malaysia's Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad on Tuesday said that the man was in a stable condition and receiving treatment at a Sungai Buloh Hospital. SOUTH KOREA WHO: A 36-year-old man and a 38-year-old man who attended the conference in Singapore. DETAILS: Media reports on Wednesday said that the men had come into contact with the Malaysian who had tested positive for the virus. The 38-year-old developed a fever two days after he returned to South Korea. Although he visited a hospital, he was not suspected to be infected as he had not been to China recently, reported the Korea Joongang Daily. However, he did not get better and visited two other hospitals. He received a call from the Malaysian on Monday, who told him that he had contracted the coronavirus. The South Korean then contacted a community health centre on Tuesday and was later tested positive for the virus. UNITED KINGDOM WHO: A middle-aged man who travelled to Singapore. DETAILS: He became the UK's third confirmed case of the novel coronavirus, reported The Guardian on Thursday. He is the first British national to contract the virus. After confirming that he had travelled to the UK from outside China, UK officials placed doctors on alert for cases of people returning from countries previously not considered a risk, The Guardian reported. He is the fourth overseas case linked to Singapore. TIMES CULTURAL ARTS LION DANCE TROUPE Lion dance troupe Times Cultural Arts performed at the Servomex conference at the Grand Hyatt hotel level one ballroom in the early morning of Jan 20. A member of the troupe confirmed the performance took place and told CNA on Thursday that they have not been in contact with any authorities after performing at the hotel. “We didn’t have much concern because it is just a five minute concert. And we didn’t have contact with the guests, because (we were) performing on a stage.” He added that they were engaged by an events company, and did not interact directly with any delegates. The lion dance troupe uploaded a series of photos of the performance on Facebook on Jan 20. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Copyright© Mediacorp 2020. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

10 Feb 2020 08:22PM,Singapore working with international body to develop vaccine for novel coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore is working “very closely” with an international body to deploy a vaccine against the novel coronavirus, said infectious diseases expert Wang Linfa on Monday (Feb 10). The Republic is working with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a public-private coalition created to develop vaccines to stop future epidemics. CEPI last week opened a call for proposals to rapidly develop and manufacture a vaccine that can be used against the novel coronavirus. Under the CEPI initiative, front runners will be chosen by the end of this week, and they will be given at least 16 weeks to develop the vaccine. It will be then decided if the vaccine is ready for a Phase 1 clinical trial. “We are trying to convince them to do a Phase 1 clinical trial in Singapore,” Professor Wang said. Prof Wang, director of the Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases at Duke-National University of Singapore (NUS) Medical School, was speaking at a media conference held at A*Star for scientists and researchers to share their work surrounding the novel coronavirus. However, the vaccine could take some time yet. Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, programme leader of Infectious Diseases at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School said it will take some time, “probably at least a year” before there is a vaccine that is commercially available. “That’s because the vaccine needs to be safe, it needs to be proven to be effective. Even if this outbreak is contained, which we all hope it will be, it will still be nice to have a vaccine, because at this point we don’t know if it will come back again,” he said. Prof Wang said that if the virus remains the way it is - with minimal change among the cases seen in different countries, the vaccine may be able to offer long-term protection. As of Monday, there were 45 confirmed cases of the virus in Singapore. There are more than 40,000 infected around the world, mostly in mainland China, and more than 900 have died from the disease. LOOKING FOR MEDICINES THAT WORK In the meantime, a few patients here have been given a drug typically used to treat the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), said Associate Professor David Lye, director at the Infectious Disease Research and Training Office at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). When patients are given HIV medication, medical professionals look out for whether their oxygen requirement improves, whether their fever subsides, and whether their swabs come back negative for the coronavirus, he said. “With the small number of patients and with people reporting their use in other countries in small numbers without detailed data, it’s very hard to say whether they work or not. Our experience is that in some patients, we see a very rapid response. ""But we also see people who continue to worsen and require assistance to breathe through a machine,” he said. Assoc Prof Lye, who is in the World Health Organization’s protocol writing committee, is involved in designing a study to test the efficacy of existing medication against the novel coronavirus. “The experts are working very hard to develop protocol, we are discussing how to design the study, what sort of patients do we include? If they are patients without symptoms, but they are positive, do you give them potentially drugs with side effects?"" The sort of drugs to be used is also being debated, he added. A drug tested for Ebola seemed to have “very good activity” for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the novel coronavirus in animal models, although it has not been used to treat the novel coronavirus in humans, he said. “We need to be part of an international collaboration because there’s nothing worse than having a very small study and giving the wrong results,” he said. NCID executive director Leo Yee Sin said that patients are being given supportive treatment in the meantime. “This means making sure hydration and nutrition are maintained. If lung is the primary organ infected, you want to make sure that they have enough capacity to maintain a good oxygen level,” she said. Assoc Prof Lye stressed the importance of an international study. “We cannot be like in Severe Acute Respiratory Sydrome (SARS) time when we just used trial and error.” “We hope to bring to our Singapore patients a proper randomised controlled trial very very soon,” he said.

01 Feb 2020 03:43PM,Wuhan coronavirus: Batik Air to evacuate Indonesians in Hubei,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners JAKARTA: A Batik Air flight departed from Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta International airport on Saturday (Feb 1) to Wuhan, China to evacuate 245 Indonesians who are trapped in Hubei province, the Indonesian government said. There are 245 Indonesians in Hubei, mostly in Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, and once they have returned they will be quarantined in the Natuna Islands. The Indonesians are all in good condition, foreign minister Retno Marsudi said. ""I've been communicating with them since last night and I've received reports that they are healthy and happy to return home,"" Mdm Marsudi said. Health minister Terawan Agus Putranto said that the Indonesians have been screened according to WHO protocols. ""We have already screened and cleared them. The ones we are going to carry back home are healthy Indonesians citizens,"" Mr Putranto said. A total of 250 Indonesians, including evacuation personnel, are expected to arrive in Indonesia on Sunday and they will then be quarantined in Natuna, military chief Hadi Tjahjanto said. ""The military supports the return (of the citizens) from Wuhan to Indonesia by providing facilities and infrastructure in accordance to health protocols. ""We have a place of isolation far from the population, and the best and chosen place is Natuna,"" military chief Hadi Tjahjanto said. He added that Natuna was chosen because it is a military base and is equipped with a hospital run by the military. ""So there are doctors from the army, navy, and air force. It also has a runway which is near to the isolation (quarantine) place,"" he added. The Batik Air flight is also carrying masks and surgical units to be handed to the government of China, Mdm Marsudi said. The move to evacuate the Indonesians comes after Mdm Marsudi said on Friday that China had cleared planes to fly to the virus-hit Chinese province of Hubei to evacuate Indonesian citizens from the area. More than 11,000 cases of the Wuhan coronavirus have been confirmed since it emerged late December in China. The virus has reached to more than 20 countries with more than 100 cases outside of China, but Indonesia has yet to report its first case. Indonesia has tested several individuals suspected of having contracted the coronavirus but as of Saturday all have been declared negative.

09 Feb 2020 02:19PM,Singapore Airshow organiser to limit public day tickets amid coronavirus concerns,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The organiser of the Singapore Airshow plans to sell fewer tickets to the public as part of measures against the novel coronavirus, as it confirmed more than 70 participating companies have pulled out. Experia Events managing director Leck Chet Lam said he expects ticket sales to be “significantly less than half” compared to the previous edition of the airshow in 2018, which attracted nearly 80,000 public visitors over two days. “We are looking at how we can have a smaller public day attendance,” he told reporters on Sunday (Feb 9), adding that there is also an idea to sell less tickets ""so that the attendance will be controlled.” He did not say how many public day tickets have currently been sold or what the allocation is. When asked what will happen to existing ticket holders if the limit is exceeded, Mr Leck said the organiser will “work it out” with them. “That’s also part of looking at the situation and making sure we take care of the well-being of people who are attending the show,” he added. Mr Leck also revealed that more than 70 participating companies have pulled out of attending the airshow, although he said this represents less than eight per cent of the initial turnout. Nineteen exhibitors have confirmed they are not attending, including US defence contractor Lockheed Martin. This means there will be 10 to 15 fewer static aircraft displays than the 45 in 2018, Mr Leck said. This comes after Singapore on Friday raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange, as authorities announced three new cases of the virus, bringing the total to 40. Under the new DORSCON level, organisers of large events should take necessary precautions such as carrying out temperature screening, looking out for respiratory symptoms like cough or runny nose, and denying entry to unwell individuals. The Ministry of Health had also urged organisers to cancel or defer non-essential large-scale events. AIRSHOW WILL GO ON When asked if the airshow will be cancelled if the DORSCON level was raised to the maximum Red, Mr Leck said the organiser will refer to guidelines by the relevant authorities. As for now, Mr Leck said the airshow – which he described as an “important node” in the global aviation industry – will go on. “Our responsibility is to still carry on with the show so exhibitors and trade visitors continue to have a platform to meet and talk about business opportunities,” he said. “Those who have pulled out, we respect their decision. Those who chose to come, we also respect it, and how we respect that is we put all the necessary preventive measures on site to make sure their well-being is taken care of.”   As part of measures against the outbreak, the organiser has implemented seat tagging for all seated events to facilitate contact tracing, and temperature screening at Singapore Expo and Changi Exhibition Centre access points. The organiser also encourages alternative greetings among attendees like waving or bowing, instead of the conventional handshake. This is in addition to measures like more frequent cleaning, having doctors and medics on site, and making hand sanitisers available. Mr Leck said the public will have to “make their own decisions” on whether they should buy a ticket. “But if they choose to come to the show, we have put all the precautionary measures in place,” he added.

09 Feb 2020 12:50AM,Head of WHO-led coronavirus probe team leaving for China,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners GENEVA: The head of a World Health Organization-led international team investigating the coronavirus outbreak will leave for China on Monday or Tuesday, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Saturday (Feb 8). Tedros, asked whether the team would include experts from the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), told a press conference on Saturday: ""We hope so."" The death toll in mainland China rose to 723 on Saturday, the WHO said, looking likely to pass the 774 deaths recorded globally during the 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Across mainland China, the number of cases stood at 34,598. Dr. Mike Ryan, WHO's top emergency expert, said there had been a stabilisation in the number of new cases reported from Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus, over the past four days. ""That's good news, and may reflect the impact of the control measures put in place. But remember there are also lots of suspected cases still to be tested."" Ryan, speaking later to Reuters, said: ""The daily number of new cases has been stable over a four-day period. The same number each day, around."" He added, ""It's not a decline. That can just mean four days of relative calm before it accelerates."" China has struggled to contain the current virus despite having placed around 56 million people under effective lockdown in Hubei and its provincial capital, Wuhan. Other cities far from the epicentre have also taken measures to keep people indoors, limiting the number of individuals who can leave their home. Friday's death of a 34-year-old Wuhan doctor who was punished for raising the alarm about the virus in December sparked an outpouring of grief and anger over the government's handling of the crisis. The virus has spread to two dozen countries, prompting several governments to ban arrivals from China and urge their citizens to avoid travelling to the country. Some have recommended their citizens leave China. Major airlines have suspended flights to and from China. At least 61 people on board a cruise ship off Japan have tested positive for the new coronavirus, with thousands of passengers and crew facing a two-week quarantine. The contagion emerged in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan in December, later spreading to the rest of China and more than two dozen other countries, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a global emergency. The number of confirmed infections in China could still grow significantly, with the health commission saying that more than 26,000 other people were ""suspected"" of having contracted the virus.

02 Feb 2020 11:27AM,Philippines reports first Wuhan coronavirus death outside China,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners MANILA: The Philippines has reported the first death outside China from the coronavirus that has killed more than 300 and spread to other countries, the World Health Organization said on Sunday (Feb 2). The fatality is a Chinese man from the city of Wuhan, where the virus was first detected. ""This is the first reported death outside China,"" Rabindra Abeyasinghe, the WHO representative to the Philippines, told reporters. ""However, we need to take into mind that this is not a locally acquired case. This patient came from the epicentre of this outbreak,"" Abeyasinghe added. The 44-year-old man arrived in the Philippines with a Chinese woman who had also tested positive for the virus, health secretary Francisco Duque said. The man developed severe pneumonia after being admitted to a government hospital in Manila on Jan 25, the Department of Health said. While the patient who died was ""stable and showed signs of improvement"" during his last few days in the hospital, his condition deteriorated in the 24 hours before he died, Duque told reporters. She was the Philippines' first case of the virus and is recovering in hospital.  Twenty-four patients previously under investigation for infection tested negative for the new coronavirus, while samples from four other patients were still being tested, the health department said. Passengers aboard the flights of the two positive cases were being traced, he said. The two patients had taken Cebu Pacific flights from Hong Kong to Cebu and from Cebu to Dumaguete in central Philippines, the airline said in a statement. The cabin crew and pilots on affected flights have been quarantined, and the aircraft have undergone thorough disinfection, it said. Cebu Air and two other Philippine carriers, Philippine Airlines and the local unit of AirAsia Group Bhd, have cancelled flights to China this month, joining many others around the world that have done the same. CLOSING BORDERS The WHO last week declared the situation a global health emergency. The first foreign fatality came as an escalating number of governments around the world closed their borders to people from China in a bid to stop it spreading. The Philippines announced it would immediately halt the arrivals of any foreign travellers from China. The United States, Australia and Israel have banned foreign nationals from visiting if they had been in China over the previous 14 days, and warned their own citizens from travelling there. Mongolia, Russia and Nepal closed their land borders, while Papua New Guinea went as far as to ban anyone arriving from ports or airports across Asia. The death toll in China soared to 304 on Sunday, with authorities reporting 45 new deaths from the previous day. There were 2,590 new confirmed cases in China, bringing the total to nearly 14,500.

08 Feb 2020 01:41PM,"Novel coronavirus claims first foreign victims as US citizen, Japanese man die in Wuhan","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: A US citizen who was diagnosed with the novel coronavirus and a Japanese man suspected to have the infection have both died in Wuhan. ""We can confirm that a 60-year-old US citizen diagnosed with coronavirus died at a hospital in Wuhan, China, on Feb 6,"" an embassy spokesman told AFP on Saturday (Feb 8), without specifying the person's gender. ""We offer the sincerest condolences to the family for their loss,"" the spokesman said, adding that no further comment would be made out of respect for the family's privacy. The Japanese foreign ministry in a statement on Saturday also said that one of its citizens with a suspected coronavirus infection has died in a hospital in the Chinese city. The man in his 60s had been hospitalised due to severe pneumonia and the hospital reported his death to the Japanese embassy in China, the ministry said in a statement. Chinese medical authorities said the man was highly likely to have been infected with the new coronavirus but ""it is difficult to make a definitive judgment"", the statement said. His cause of death was given as viral pneumonia, it added. These latest cases would be the first confirmed foreign deaths in China from the outbreak. Two people have died from the virus outside the mainland: A man from Wuhan in the Philippines and a 39-year-old man in Hong Kong. At least 722 people have died from the virus in China while more than 34,000 have been infected, according to the latest official figures. The Chinese foreign ministry said on Thursday that 19 foreigners have been infected in China, and two of them have recovered. The ministry refused to disclose their nationalities.

02 Feb 2020 06:06AM,"Commentary: As a parent, I worry about my kids and the Wuhan coronavirus situation. So I’m taking action","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners News of the Wuhan coronavirus have created anxiety and fear among parents. June Yong admits she shares some of these sentiments but shares her experience on what’s getting her through. SINGAPORE: Over the past week or so, the spotlight shifted very quickly from Chinese New Year festivities to the deadly coronavirus. As a parent with three kids in primary school, I couldn’t help but feel on the edge as the day to return to school post-CNY drew near. News about the compulsory leave of absence (LOA) for teachers and students returning from China helped settle the jitters somewhat but did not remove it completely. I was also in a dilemma. As my second child was still recovering from a flu bug, I wasn’t entirely sure whether he was well enough to return to school. In the end, I kept all three at home on the first day. To be absolutely honest, I’m not sure if it was more responsible parenting or paranoia driving that decision. Apparently I wasn’t the only one who was gripped by fear, as a few of my daughter’s classmates were absent on that day too. But when she begged to go to school the next day, I relented. What kind of message would I be sending my kids if I allowed fear to steer my every course? FEAR IN THE DRIVER’S SEAT In the movie Inside Out, we get an insider perspective of what goes on in the emotional world of Riley, the main character of the show. It was fascinating to watch how each of her five basic emotions — Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger — took control at the console of her mind. In today’s virus-warped world, it is apparent that Fear is in the driver’s seat. This is the primary emotion that is causing people to grab and hoard masks, despite the government’s call to use them responsibly and only when feeling unwell. It is the emotion driving restaurant owners in Korea to put up signs saying “no Chinese allowed”. It is also the emotion that is causing us to think twice about sending our children to school. Now it is perfectly normal to be fearful, given that there are a lot of unknowns about this virus: When it is contagious — upon infection or post-symptom, how it is transmitted, who are most at risk, and how long it will take to die down. The accelerating pace of the virus spread in China and around the world is also making it hard to get a handle on the situation. As parents, we worry that the situation will turn south very quickly, and we don’t want to see our offspring suffering needlessly. So we pull out all the stops to ensure their safety, whether it is by keeping them home, driving them to and from school, skipping unnecessary events, or getting them masks. More than a week back, many of us also called on the Government to take action and prevent Hubei nationals and travellers from entering Singapore when the situation took a turn for the worse, a move that was eventually made. But the question remains: How much is safe enough? And for a parent, is school okay but not tuition and enrichment activities? How long can we maintain this state of hyper-vigilance? Last Thursday, I brought my boys for their usual badminton lessons and we practically had the entire hall to ourselves. We all hope that the virus will disappear in weeks, and that it will neither run the months-long course as SARS nor come anywhere close to the impact it had. But one thing seems certain: We have not seen the peak yet, and the number of infected cases around the world is going to rise. Elsewhere including the US, community spread has already occurred. Experts are saying the virus may continue for the next few months given how fast it’s been spreading. KEEPING ANXIETY IN CHECK My WhatsApp chat groups have been buzzing with information shared by parents on how to protect ourselves and where to get masks, sanitisers and anti-bacterial wipes. While mostly useful, it also induces anxiety. The past week, I’ve noticed moments when I felt harried and breathless, and I think it could be my body’s stress response. In the first few days of the newsbreak, I also found myself using negative terms such as “your immunity will be weak” or “the virus will make you very sick” in a bid to scare them into washing their hands properly before meals. I’ve since tried to be more measured in my word choices, so as not to create greater anxiety in my kids, using a more positive tone such as “let’s keep ourselves healthy during this period”. It may seem small in the scheme of things but this is the time to exercise leadership and role-modelling as parents. Part of this is to avoid stressing our kids out unduly. LEARNING FROM THE JAPANESE When a perceived threat is imminent and unknown, we will all experience a period of heightened fear and irrational behaviour. Because of the scarcity of masks or other health-related goods, people start to eye one another suspiciously. Every sneeze or slight clearing of throat is enough to get you stares on public transport. Caution is certainly needed but we may need time to adjust and allow other healthier emotions to take their rightful place at the wheel, perhaps those of perseverance, hope and level-headedness. In this regard, we could learn from the Japanese. Japan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. Children there are taught earthquake survival skills early on in their lives. Schools run regular earthquake drills, educating kids on the best way to stay safe during an earthquake. One common strategy taught is for children to get under their desks and hold onto their table legs until the trembling is over. If playing outside, children are taught to go to the centre of an open space to avoid falling objects. Since we will need time to bring the virus to heel, we should instill good hygiene habits in our young. From washing hands properly, to practising good cough etiquette by covering your mouth or using a mask, and handling and disposing masks carefully — if we train them up well in these areas, as a society we will enjoy stronger defences against the coronavirus and future viruses as well.   Along with staying home if one is ill instead of heading out, these are good habits we should instill in our children irrespective of news of this pandemic. A PARENT’S WISH LIST When I picked the kids up after school last week, I asked if their teachers had encouraged them to wash their hands, or given them more water breaks to hydrate their bodies. I was a tad disappointed to hear that there were no such exhortations. Granted, even if the teachers instruct, kids being kids, some may not take these seriously and just do a cursory wash. So parents cannot abdicate our responsibility in drilling our kids. Given the potential danger a community spread in schools could cause, I think more can be done in the area of educating our children on hygiene and viral protection. Experts have emphasised that this battle will not be won on the back of masks or sanitisers, but one’s level of personal hygiene. Dr Leong Hoe Nam, Infectious Disease Specialist humorously shared his golden rule in a radio interview: “Don’t touch your face. Your face is sacred.” I told this to my children and they laughed; I certainly hope it makes the message stick. I think schools have done well thus far in keeping parents abreast of the latest protective measures. Apart from daily temperature taking and implementing the LOA, they can also consider using curriculum time set aside for Health Education or PAL (Programme for Active Learning) to inculcate healthy hygiene habits. After all, real-life experiences, even crises, are often where textbook lessons can be brought to life THE CHOICES WE EXERCISE We do not know how this pandemic will pan out, but we can control our thoughts and choices today. By all means, take the necessary precautions but in order to emerge unscathed through this crisis, we need to balance fear with equal doses of calm, wit and trust. By practising good hygiene habits as a family, we can go about our daily lives like the Japanese children, with hope and optimism while constantly vigilant for the next alarm. If we manage ourselves well, this crisis could turn out to be an opportunity for us and our children to learn a kind of resilience that could shelter Singapore for years to come — no matter what virus mutations come our way.

All the attendees at the Jan 20 to Jan 22 private business meeting were from one company, said MOH. Of the participants, 15 were Singapore residents and 94 were from overseas. Four of the 15 Singapore residents reported having symptoms and have been referred to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases for assessment, said MOH. The remaining 11 are well. All of the foreign participants have left Singapore, said MOH, adding that it has informed the relevant overseas health authorities. Malaysia announced on Tuesday that a 42-year-old Malaysian man who had been at the business meeting developed symptoms on Jan 29 and subsequently tested positive for the coronavirus on Feb 3. Malaysian authorities are tracking his close contacts. On Wednesday, South Korea reported that two of its citizens - a 38-year-old man and a 36-year-old man - who had attended the business meeting at the hotel had also been infected.   A spokesman for the Grand Hyatt Hotel confirmed on Wednesday that the Malaysian had stayed at the hotel for a week in mid-January. He added that the hotel has been deep cleaned and it is not aware of any other cases among its hotel guests or staff. The coronavirus have killed nearly 500 people and infected more than 24,000 in China. The disease is believed to have emerged in December in a Wuhan market that sold wild animals, and spread rapidly as people travelled for the Chinese New Year holiday in January.

27 Jan 2020 07:23PM,Russian operators stop selling tours to China over coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners MOSCOW: Russian tour operators have stopped selling package holidays to China due to the coronavirus outbreak there and are only bringing Russian tourists home, Dmitry Gorin, vice president of the Association of Russian Tour Operators, said on Monday (Jan 27). The move was taken at the recommendation of Rosturizm, Russia's state tourism agency, he said, as the death toll from the new virus in China rose to 81 with more than 2,740 people infected. Russia, which does not have any confirmed cases of the new virus, has direct daily flights to several Chinese cities and has ramped up sanitary and quarantine control at all entry points. ""Tours are not being sold because there is a safety threat,"" Gorin told Reuters. ""Sales stopped on Friday."" Moscow has been in talks with China about evacuating Russian nationals from the Chinese city of Wuhan and Hubei province that are at the centre of the outbreak, Russia's embassy in China said on Saturday. Wuhan, a city of 11 million people and capital of Hubei province, is in virtual lockdown and severe limits on movement are in place in several other Chinese cities. Much of Hubei, home to nearly 60 million people, is subject to some kind of travel restrictions. Direct flights to Moscow from Wuhan were suspended last week. At least 140 Russians, 75 of them students, are known to be in Wuhan and Hubei, the Russian embassy in China said on Monday, the TASS news agency reported. Around 7,000 Russian tourists who bought package holidays are currently still in China, Gorin said. Around 6,000 of those are on Hainan island with the rest on the mainland, he said. Russians will be reimbursed for cancelled tours, while those being repatriated from China early will be partially reimbursed, Gorin said. Russia is working to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus strain, the consumer safety regulator said on Wednesday.

06 Feb 2020 12:29AM,"What we know about the 4 new coronavirus cases in Singapore, including 6-month-old baby","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Four new cases of the novel coronavirus in Singapore – including a six-month-old baby – were confirmed on Wednesday (Feb 5). Three of the four new cases are linked to the local transmission cluster announced by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Tuesday. The fourth case is linked to a patient confirmed in January. The four patients are in stable condition, MOH said. Wednesday's announcement brings the total number of cases in Singapore to 28. This is what we know about cases 25, 26, 27 and 28: Cases 25, 27 and 28 are part of a local cluster of transmission involving cases 19, 20, 21 and 24, which can be traced to a Chinese tour group. The tour group from Guangxi comprised 20 tourists who had visited Singapore last month. Two travellers from that group have tested positive for the coronavirus, Chinese health authorities confirmed. During their time in Singapore, they visited at least six places in Singapore, including Yong Thai Hang, a health product shop.   CASES 27 AND 28 Cases 27 and 28 are family members of case 19 – a 28-year-old Singapore permanent resident who works as a salesperson at Yong Thai Hang. All three do not have recent travel history to China. The salesperson was tested positive for the coronavirus on Monday and is warded at Singapore General Hospital (SGH). Case 27 is her husband, a 45-year-old Singaporean who tested positive for the virus on Wednesday at about 2pm. He is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). He developed symptoms on Feb 1 and visited a general practitioner clinic the next day. He was subsequently isolated at NCID on Feb 4. Prior to hospital admission, he stayed at his home at Jalan Bukit Merah and worked as a private hire driver. He indicated that he had visited Tiong Bahru Plaza, Tiong Bahru Market and Beo Crescent Market and Food Centre. The risk of infection from transient contact, such as on public transport or in public places, is assessed to be low, MOH said. Case 28 is the couple’s six-month-old son. He also tested positive on Wednesday at about 2pm, and is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. MOH said in an update on Thursday that the child was not in any infant care facility and was cared for at home, prior to being admitted to the hospital. The family’s foreign domestic worker (case 21), an Indonesian national with no recent travel history to China, is also warded with the virus at SGH. Case 20, a colleague of Case 19 at Yong Thai Hang, was admitted to NCID on Monday and tested positive. CASE 25 Case 25 is the husband of case 24, a 32-year-old Singaporean woman who works as a tourist guide and brought visitors to Yong Thai Hang. She had gone to NCID on Monday and was confirmed positive on Tuesday at about 2pm. “While she had previously reported that she was asymptomatic when she went to NCID, she subsequently informed NCID on (Tuesday) night that she had developed a fever on Jan 30,” MOH said.  Prior to admission to NCID, she stayed at her home at Buangkok Green and worked at Jalan Besar. She had visited Hougang Polyclinic on Jan 30 and went to a supermarket near her home. Her husband - case 25 - is a 40-year-old Singaporean who developed a fever on Jan 24. He visited the same polyclinic as his wife on Jan 30, and self-presented at NCID on Monday, where he was immediately isolated. He was tested positive on Tuesday, at about 8pm. Prior to being admitted, case 25 had stayed at home. He worked at Diamond Industries Jewellery Company at Harbour Drive, which the tour group from Guangxi had visited as well. He had also visited Pasir Panjang Hawker Centre and travelled by public transport. “The risk of infection from transient contact, such as on public transport or in public places, is assessed to be low,” MOH said. CASE 26 Case 26 - a 42-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan - is the daughter of a previously confirmed case, case 13. They arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 21. She was conveyed by ambulance to NCID on the same day as her 73-year-old mother on Jan 28 after developing symptoms. Subsequent test results confirmed on Tuesday that she was infected with the coronavirus. The elderly woman was a close contact of the second confirmed case, who also arrived in Singapore on Jan 21.     OTHER PLACES THE TOUR GROUP VISITED The tour group of 20 had arrived in Singapore on Jan 22 and left for Malaysia on Jan 24. On Jan 27, the group came back to Singapore at about 3am and they left the country at about 6am, MOH said. Besides Yong Thai Hang and Diamond Industries Jewellery Company, the group also visited: “It has been almost 14 days since the tourists visited these places,” MOH said. The ministry has reached out to 142 contacts, of which all but one are well. The person has been isolated as a suspect case and test results are pending. Contact tracing was also conducted for the crew and passengers of the departing flight on Jan 27. Five are in Singapore and have been quarantined. As of 11.59pm last Saturday, all new visitors with recent travel history to mainland China will not be allowed to enter Singapore. These visitors will also not be allowed to transit in Singapore. Those with Chinese passports, with the exception of Singapore permanent residents (PRs) and long-term pass holders, will also not be allowed to enter Singapore.

31 Jan 2020 10:26AM,Japan speeds up new Wuhan coronavirus measures as more evacuees arrive,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TOKYO: Japan said on Friday (Jan 31) that it would bring forward the date that the coronavirus will become a ""designated infectious disease"" to Saturday from Feb 7, as a third chartered flight carrying Japanese citizens arrived from Wuhan. The measures were due to come into effect from Feb 7, but will now be moved up to Feb 1, Shinzo Abe told parliament. ""With this measure, we will refuse infected individuals entry to Japan,"" Abe said. ""We will swiftly study ways to strengthen immigration control for cases where infection is suspected but not confirmed,"" he added. Japan now has 14 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, an epidemic that is believed to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Two of those returned on the first chartered flight and had shown no symptoms. As worries grew in Japan over a further spread of the disease, the government said it would refuse entry to anyone infected and consider stricter screening for suspected cases, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said. Suga also told a news conference that the government would consider paying for the chartered flights out of Wuhan, as opposition lawmakers criticised its policy of charging passengers 80,000 yen (US$730) each. ""We decided on these changes in view of the World Health Organization's (WHO) declaration of a global emergency,"" Suga said. The government classified the new coronavirus as a designated infectious disease on Tuesday, but the designation was only set to take effect on Feb 7 after ordinances are issued, in line with regulations. The designation allows compulsory hospitalisation and the use of public funds for treatment, among other measures. The third flight out of Wuhan, which arrived on Friday morning, brings the total number of expatriated nationals to 565, Suga said. Unlike other countries, which are opting to isolate returning citizens for between 72 hours and two weeks, Japan has asked evacuees to ""self-quarantine"". Japanese officials say there is no legal basis for them to forcibly isolate people who have not tested positive for the virus - and that will not change with the implementation of the new rules from Saturday. There was also outrage after it emerged that two people on the first evacuation flight from Wuhan initially refused to be tested for the virus, and were allowed to return home after being advised to avoid public transport and monitor their health. The government has said it cannot force people to take the test, and on Thursday night health ministry officials said the two individuals had now changed their minds and would take the test. Of the 206 people who arrived on a first flight on Wednesday, 12 have been hospitalised, with all but two of the other passengers staying at a government-designated hotel in Chiba outside Tokyo. A second evacuation flight carrying 210 people arrived on Thursday, with 26 passengers hospitalised after checks on board and at a health facility after landing. The remaining passengers are staying at government-designated accommodation, and all the passengers on the second flight were tested for the new virus, officials said.

24 Jan 2020 07:03AM,WHO says 'bit too early' to declare coronavirus a global emergency,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners GENEVA: The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Thursday (Jan 23) it was ""a bit too early"" to declare a new coronavirus a global health emergency as China put millions of people on lockdown amid an outbreak. Just hours later, China reported that the number of confirmed cases had risen to 830, with 25 dead. The National Health Commission said authorities were also examining 1,072 suspected cases of the virus that first emerged in central city of Wuhan. Non-fatal cases have been found in at least seven other countries. Health officials fear the transmission rate could accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel at home and abroad during week-long holidays for Chinese New Year, which begins on Saturday. Nonetheless, it was a ""bit too early"" to consider the outbreak a ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern,"" WHO Emergency Committee panel chair Didier Houssin said after the body met in Geneva. Such a designation would have required countries to step up the international response. ""Make no mistake, though, this is an emergency in China,"" said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. ""It has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one,"" he said. Scrambling to contain the outbreak, the local government in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in Hubei province, suspended most transport on Thursday, including outgoing flights, and people were told not to leave. Hours later, neighboring Huanggang, a city of about 7 million people, announced similar measures. By Friday, 10 cities near Wuhan had halted public transport, effectively placing a quarantine on 20 million people. ""The lockdown of 11 million people is unprecedented in public health history,"" said Gauden Galea, the WHO's representative in Beijing.   The organisation said, however, that it was not yet recommending any broader restrictions on travel or trade.  The previously unknown virus strain is believed to have emerged late last year from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in Wuhan. It has created alarm because there are a number of unknowns surrounding it. It is too early to know just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. There is no vaccine for the virus, which can spread through respiratory transmission. Symptoms include fever, difficulty breathing and coughing.  Michael Ryan, head of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, said data from China suggested almost three-quarters of the cases were in people aged over 40, with some 40% having underlying health conditions. ""At the moment, we haven't seen many mild cases,"" he said, cautioning that it was difficult at the start of an epidemic to estimate the severity or true fatality rate. There had been human-to-human transmission of the virus in China, limited to family groups and health workers, said Tedros. Three research teams working on a vaccine, a global coalition set up to fight diseases said. It is aiming to have a shot developed and approved within a year. The committee of 16 independent experts had been divided in its conclusion not to declare a global emergency, said Tedros, adding that the decision ""should not be taken as a sign that the WHO does not think the situation is serious."" Peter Piot, a professor of global health and director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the outbreak was at a critical phase. ""Regardless of the decision not to declare this a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, intensified international collaboration and more resources will be crucial to stopping this outbreak in its tracks,"" he said. ""There cannot be any complacency as to the need for global action."" The biggest tumble in Chinese stocks in more than eight months led global equity markets lower on Thursday as concern mounted about the outbreak. TRAVEL WARNINGS In Wuhan, the Hankou railway station was nearly deserted on Thursday, state broadcasts showed. State media reported highway toll booths around Wuhan were closing, effectively cutting off road exits, and all ride-hailing services would be cancelled from Friday. Guards were patrolling highways, one resident said.   As the city slipped into isolation, residents thronged hospitals for medical checks and rushed to buy supplies, clearing out supermarket shelves and queuing for petrol. Other cities were also taking steps to contain the virus. Nearby Ezhou shut train stations. Beijing cancelled large gatherings, including two Lunar New Year temple fairs, and closed the Forbidden City, the capital's most famous tourist attraction, to visitors until further notice. The US State Department warned travellers to exercise increased caution in China as airports worldwide stepped up the screening of passengers arriving from the country. Cases have already been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States. Five people were being tested in Scotland for the virus as a precaution, the BBC reported on Thursday. All had respiratory symptoms and had recently been in Wuhan, it said. Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, which has two confirmed cases, is turning two holiday camps into quarantine stations as a precaution. Taiwan has banned anyone from Wuhan from going to the island. Chinese people had their own ways of protecting themselves. ""I go straight to where I need to go, and then I go home,"" said 79-year-old Li Meihua, from behind a mask, on the streets of Shanghai.

""Minimum connectivity"" to several key cities will be maintained, SIA said. The move comes after demand for air travel between Singapore and China declined significantly as a result of the outbreak, said SIA on its website. As a result, services to some Chinese destinations will be ""temporarily suspended until the situation improves"", it added. Several SIA flights between Singapore and Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou will be suspended between Feb 4 and Mar 29. Some SilkAir flights between Singapore and Shenzhen, Xiamen, Chengdu and Chongqing will be halted during that period.  SIA said that the group will maintain some connectivity to key cities. In response to queries, SIA told CNA that following the reduced frequencies, it will operate seven flights each to Beijing and Shanghai weekly, thrice a week to Guangzhou and once a week to Chongqing. ""There are still many Singaporeans working and living in China now, many of whom will still require connectivity between Singapore and China,"" said SIA. ""As the national carrier, we will continue to maintain minimum connectivity to the key cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chongqing for now despite the reduced demand,"" added SIA.   SIA had said on Jan 31 said it would reduce capacity on some of its routes to China in February due to the growing scale of the coronavirus epidemic. SIA's low-cost carrier Scoot also suspended flights to 11 Chinese cities from early February until the end of March and reduced frequencies to eight other Chinese destinations.  Singapore on Friday raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange, after several cases of coronavirus without travel history to mainland China or links to previous cases. The virus has infected 43 people in Singapore as of Sunday, six of whom have been discharged.

09 Feb 2020 12:50AM,Head of WHO-led coronavirus probe team leaving for China,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners GENEVA: The head of a World Health Organization-led international team investigating the coronavirus outbreak will leave for China on Monday or Tuesday, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Saturday (Feb 8). Tedros, asked whether the team would include experts from the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), told a press conference on Saturday: ""We hope so."" The death toll in mainland China rose to 723 on Saturday, the WHO said, looking likely to pass the 774 deaths recorded globally during the 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Across mainland China, the number of cases stood at 34,598. Dr. Mike Ryan, WHO's top emergency expert, said there had been a stabilisation in the number of new cases reported from Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus, over the past four days. ""That's good news, and may reflect the impact of the control measures put in place. But remember there are also lots of suspected cases still to be tested."" Ryan, speaking later to Reuters, said: ""The daily number of new cases has been stable over a four-day period. The same number each day, around."" He added, ""It's not a decline. That can just mean four days of relative calm before it accelerates."" China has struggled to contain the current virus despite having placed around 56 million people under effective lockdown in Hubei and its provincial capital, Wuhan. Other cities far from the epicentre have also taken measures to keep people indoors, limiting the number of individuals who can leave their home. Friday's death of a 34-year-old Wuhan doctor who was punished for raising the alarm about the virus in December sparked an outpouring of grief and anger over the government's handling of the crisis. The virus has spread to two dozen countries, prompting several governments to ban arrivals from China and urge their citizens to avoid travelling to the country. Some have recommended their citizens leave China. Major airlines have suspended flights to and from China. At least 61 people on board a cruise ship off Japan have tested positive for the new coronavirus, with thousands of passengers and crew facing a two-week quarantine. The contagion emerged in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan in December, later spreading to the rest of China and more than two dozen other countries, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a global emergency. The number of confirmed infections in China could still grow significantly, with the health commission saying that more than 26,000 other people were ""suspected"" of having contracted the virus.

13 Feb 2020 10:41AM,Oil rises for third day as coronavirus impact may spur output cuts,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Oil prices rose for a third day on expectations that major producers are likely to enact deeper output cuts to offset the slump in demand caused by the coronavirus outbreak in China, the world's second-largest crude consumer. SEOUL: Oil prices rose for a third day on expectations that major producers are likely to enact deeper output cuts to offset the slump in demand caused by the coronavirus outbreak in China, the world's second-largest crude consumer. Brent crude rose 17 cents, or 0.3per cent, to US$55.96 per barrel at 0217 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rose 29 cents, or 0.6per cent, to US$51.46 a barrel. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies including Russia, known as OPEC+, recommended last week an additional output cut of 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) to its current 1.7 million bpd reduction to offset the disease-related demand losses. OPEC yesterday lowered its 2020 forecast for demand for the group's crude by 200,000 bpd, prompting expectations that OPEC+ will enact the cuts when the group next meets, possibly as early as this month. Russia's government has not made clear that it will endorse the deeper cuts but a majority of Russian oil companies want the cuts extend through the second quarter at least, a senior Lukoil official said on Wednesday. ""Oil is up as OPEC awaits an official response from Russia regarding proposed production cuts,"" Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiCorp, said in a note on Thursday. Oil may also be rising as traders who opened so-called short positions, or bets that prices will fall, are buying futures contracts to lock in profits from the recent plunge in oil prices, said Innes. Brent and WTI have fallen more than 20per cent from their 2020-peak in January. The contracts rose over 3per cent on Wednesday as a slowdown in new Chinese coronavirus cases boosted expectations of a demand recovery. Those expectations for a price recovery ""should send more shorts running for cover,"" Innes said. Still, data on the number of new confirmed cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, indicates that the outbreak and its impact on oil demand will continue. New cases jumped by 14,840 on Feb. 12 to 48,206, and deaths climbed by a daily record of 242 to 1,310, the province said on Thursday, reflecting changes to the diagnostic methodology. Travel restrictions to and from China and quarantines within the country have curbed oil consumption. The expectations for lower future fuel demand because of the virus has shifted the market structure for both WTI and Brent into a contango, when prompt prices are less than later prices. The price of the front-month April Brent contract is at a current discount of 50 cents a barrel to the September future. Adding to the sense of a well-supplied market, U.S. crude inventories in the week to Feb. 7 increased by a more-than-expected 7.5 million barrels to 442.5 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. That is the highest since the week of Dec. 13. (Reporting By Jane Chung; Editing by Christian Schmollinger) It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Copyright© Mediacorp 2020.

09 Feb 2020 02:30PM,Scientists race to develop vaccine for new coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Scientists from the United States to Australia are using new technology in an ambitious, multi-million-dollar drive to develop a vaccine in record time to tackle China's coronavirus outbreak. The new virus has spread rapidly since emerging late last year in China, killing more than 800 people in the mainland and infecting over 37,000. Cases have been reported in two dozen other countries. Coming up with any vaccine typically takes years, and involves a lengthy process of testing on animals, clinical trials on humans and regulatory approvals. But several teams of experts are racing to develop one quicker, backed by an international coalition that aims to combat emerging diseases, and Australian scientists hope theirs could be ready in six months. ""It is a high-pressure situation and there is a lot of weight on us,"" said senior researcher Keith Chappell, part of the group from Australia's University of Queensland. But the scientist added he took ""some solace"" knowing several teams around the world were engaged in the same mission. ""The hope is that one of these will be successful and can contain this outbreak,"" he said.   But even a timeframe of six months looks agonisingly slow with the virus, believed to have emerged from a market selling wild animals, killing close to 100 people every day in mainland China. Efforts are being led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a body established in 2017 to finance costly biotechnology research in the wake of an Ebola outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people. With a mission to speed up the development of vaccines, CEPI is pouring millions of dollars into four projects around the world and has put out a call for more proposals. ATTACK OF THE VIRUS The projects hope to use new technology to develop vaccines that can be tested in the near future. The body's CEO, Richard Hatchett, said the aim was to start clinical testing in just 16 weeks. German biopharmaceutical company CureVac and US-based Moderna Therapeutics are developing vaccines based on ""messenger RNA"" - instructions that tell the body to produce proteins - while Inovio, another American firm, is using DNA-based technology. DNA- and RNA-based vaccines use the genetic coding of the virus to trick the body's cells into producing proteins identical to those on the surface of the pathogen, explained Ooi Eng Eong, deputy director of the emerging infectious diseases programme at the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.   The immune system learns to recognise the proteins so that it is ready to find and attack the virus when it enters the body. The Australian researchers are using ""molecular clamp"" technology invented by the university's scientists that allows them to rapidly develop new vaccines based solely on a virus DNA sequence. French scientists at the Pasteur Institute are modifying the measles vaccine to work against the coronavirus, but do not expect it to be ready for about 20 months. Meanwhile, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has also started developing vaccines, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. RISKS VERSUS BENEFITS Health authorities weigh the risks and benefits in vaccine approvals and if there is a public health emergency, the process could be shortened, said Ooi of the Duke-NUS Medical School. But he added that ""paradoxically, if the situation improves, then actually the pathway for vaccines would be longer"". ""If there's a lot of these new coronavirus cases around, then you accept some risk, because of the tremendous amount of benefit you can derive, whereas if there are not many cases, the tolerance for risk would be very low."" While there is no vaccine for the coronavirus, some doctors are trying out a potent brew of anti-retroviral and flu drugs to treat those infected, but the science is inconclusive as to whether they are effective. Ultimately, scientists may end up in the same situation they were during the 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - it died out before a vaccine could be fully developed. A close cousin of the new coronavirus, SARS spread around the world and killed nearly 800. But Ong Siew Hwa, the director of Acumen Research Laboratories, a biotech company in Singapore, said efforts to develop a vaccine for the new virus should continue even if the outbreak ends. ""I think a vaccine will definitely be important,"" she said. ""If it's not in time for this round, it is important for the next time."" It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

10 Feb 2020 07:19AM,China coronavirus death toll surpasses 900,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The number of deaths from China's new coronavirus surged past 900 in mainland China on Monday (Feb 10) after the hardest-hit province of Hubei reported 91 new fatalities. In its daily update, Hubei's health commission also confirmed another 2,618 new cases in the central province, where the outbreak emerged in December. There are now more than 39,800 confirmed cases across China, based on previously released figures from the government. The new virus is believed to have emerged last year in a market that sells wild animals in Hubei's capital Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, before spreading across the country. The latest data came after the WHO said the last four days had seen ""some stabilising"" in Hubei, but warned the figures could still ""shoot up"". The epidemic has prompted the government to lock down whole cities as anger mounts over its handling of the crisis - especially after a whistleblowing doctor fell victim to the virus.   With much of the country still not back at work after an extended Lunar New Year holiday, cities including financial hub Shanghai ordered residents to wear masks in public. Michael Ryan, head of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, said the ""stable period"" of the outbreak ""may reflect the impact of the control measures"". A WHO ""international expert mission"" left late Sunday for China, the agency's director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Twitter. The mission is led by Bruce Aylward, a veteran of previous health emergencies. While the death toll has climbed steadily, new cases have declined since Wednesday's single-day peak of nearly 3,900 people nationwide. PUBLIC ANGER Millions of people are under lockdown in Hubei in a bid to stop the virus spreading. ""The local government asked people to stay at home as much as possible, but there are not enough goods in shops each time we get there, so we have to go out frequently,"" a woman in Wuhan, surnamed Wei, told AFP. China's central bank said from Monday it would make 300 billion yuan (US$43 billion) available in special loans to banks to help businesses involved in fighting the epidemic. China drew international condemnation for covering up cases during the SARS outbreak, whereas the WHO has praised measures it has taken this time. But anger erupted after the death of a Wuhan doctor who police silenced when he flagged the emerging virus in December. The doctor, 34, died early Friday, after contracting the virus from a patient. Chinese academics were among those angered by his death, with at least two open letters posted on social media demanding more freedoms. ""Put an end to the restrictions on freedom of speech,"" one letter demanded. PERCOLATING ALONG Beijing responded by sending its anti-graft body to launch an investigation, attempting to ease the anger. But Ian Lipkin - a professor at Columbia University who worked with China on the SARS outbreak - said earlier intervention could have made a key difference. ""This virus was percolating along without anyone realising it was there,"" he said. If the quarantine measures have been effective, the epidemic should peak within the next fortnight, Lipkin added - but he warned there is also the risk of a ""bump"" in numbers when people return to work. Wuhan has converted public buildings into makeshift medical centres, and built two new field hospitals. But Wuhan resident Chen Yiping told AFP her 61-year-old mother has severe symptoms and was still waiting for a hospital bed because ""there are too many people in need of treatment"". The first foreign victim in China was confirmed when an American diagnosed with the virus died in Wuhan. The only fatalities outside the mainland have been a Chinese man in the Philippines and a 39-year-old man in Hong Kong. Seventy people on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship off Japan's coast have tested positive, with all passengers told to stay inside their cabins to prevent further infection. Several countries have banned arrivals from China while major airlines have suspended flights.

06 Feb 2020 06:28AM,Commentary: Looks like containment of novel coronavirus not as effective as we had hoped,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Critical differences between the epidemiology of the novel coronavirus and SARS make containment less effective as a strategy and mitigation more urgent, says Hitoshi Oshitani. TOKYO: A novel coronavirus is rapidly spreading within China, with more cases discovered outside the country this past week. The virus is genetically close to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus , which caused a global outbreak in 2002 to 2003. Despite their similarities, however, this new virus shares few epidemiological characteristics with SARS, which was successfully contained after causing more than 8,000 cases with 774 deaths worldwide. This new virus may be more difficult to control than SARS. The number of cases has already exceeded the total number of cases of SARS – and in just one month. It is likely that the Wuhan health authorities tried to contain the new virus using the same strategy previously used for the containment of SARS. However, containment by these means looks like an less effective means to deal with this new virus compared to SARS. We have insufficient epidemiological data to understand the whole epidemiology of this novel coronavirus because we are still in the early stages of its spread. At this time, however, we have seen some critical differences between the epidemiology of SARS and this virus that may make this much more difficult to manage than SARS. HOW EFFECTIVE IS CONTAINMENT? Active and comprehensive discovery of infected individuals, rapid isolation of cases, and identification of all close contacts by contact tracing were the fundamental strategies for the containment of SARS. However, several conditions must be met for this containment strategy to be effective.   First, the majority of the infected individuals must develop typical, identifiable clinical symptoms that can be used to distinguish between the target disease and other infections. Second, only those with typical clinical symptoms can infect others. Third, infected individuals are contagious only in the late stage of illness. For SARS, these conditions were met, and quick containment was therefore possible. Most infected individuals developed severe viral pneumonia, which was distinguishable from other infections such as seasonal influenza. Furthermore, only those with severe and typical symptoms could infect others. Finally, infected individuals were contagious only in the late stage of illness. Therefore, we were able to identify most infected individuals and isolate them as soon as they developed symptoms to prevent further transmission. Eventually, all chains of transmission were interrupted, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global containment of SARS on Jul 5, 2003 - eight months after the emergence of the virus. PROBLEMS WITH CONTAINMENT In contrast, the containment strategy used for SARS has not been successful in containing this novel coronavirus. This is because this virus does not meet the aforementioned necessary conditions. Unlike SARS, some or many infected individuals developed only mild or no symptoms, precluding the identification of all possible cases. In Singapore, some Singaporeans who had come into contact with a group of Chinese tourists were diagnosed with the infection, despite two not having any signs of pneumonia when they first presented themselves to healthcare facilities.   In Japan, five out of the 565 evacuees from China tested positive for the virus despite not having any symptoms. Furthermore, limited evidence suggests that infected individuals with mild or no symptoms can be contagious. Asymptomatic infected individuals may not be a driving force for the ongoing outbreak due to a lower chance of successful transmission compared to symptomatic cases. However, if an asymptomatic individual becomes a source of the transmission chain, then contact tracing cannot be used to identify such a chain. This is a critical problem for containment. Some accounts of transmission suggest that individuals are contagious even during the incubation period, which is the duration between exposure and the onset of symptoms. There is documented evidence indicating that a traveller from China passed the virus to some of her colleagues during the incubation period in Germany, which the science community is debating over. If cases are infectious during the incubation period, it may be too late to prevent further transmission, even if we can isolate patients soon after they develop symptoms. The majority of individuals infected with SARS did not infect any other persons. During that outbreak in Singapore in 2003, more than 80 per cent of infected individuals did not pass the virus to anyone else.   There were some “super-spreader events” in which one infected individual infected many others. These were the major amplifying factor for SARS. So far, no “super-spreading event” has been documented for the novel coronavirus, but more data is needed before we can rule out such an event. Because possibly only a small fraction of cases are being detected and reported, it is difficult to know the exact transmissibility between individuals for this virus. Due to the rapidly increasing number of cases in mainland China, its transmissibility is considered to be higher than that of SARS. In addition, the world of 2020 is quite different compared to that of 2003. Many more international flights now depart from China to many more countries than before. While SARS spread to more than 30 countries and areas within eight months, the novel coronavirus has spread to more than 20 countries within one month. No sustained human-to-human transmission has been reported outside mainland China. However, “invisible transmission chains” may already have been established in some countries. Therefore, we may see a sudden increase in the number of cases when such transmission chains are fully realised. This is becoming a real possibility. SHIFT TO MITIGATION Because containment appears less feasible and effective, we must shift our objective to mitigate the impact. Thus, the most important goal right now is to reduce the mortality rate to be as low as possible. Every country should be prepared for an increasing number of severe cases. This may be more challenging in countries with limited healthcare resources. We urgently need to establish a mechanism to support these countries. It is difficult to predict how the outbreak will evolve in China and other countries, but an imminent risk persists of large outbreaks outside of China. The international community should work together, and China has a critical role in this battle. Other countries can learn from China’s current experience. For example, we must learn and distribute what measures are effective or ineffective. The WHO should continue to play a leading role for international coordination, especially with China, to fight against this global threat.

03 Feb 2020 06:05PM,Commentary: How effective are mass quarantines in China in curbing the spread of the novel coronavirus?,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Mass quarantines may allay public fear and provide the illusion of intervention, but they cannot be considered an evidence-based practice, says an expert. LONDON: The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. China has recorded over 17,200 cases, but under 400 deaths from the disease. As far as emerging diseases go, this virus appears relatively insipid. Despite the mild severity of this disease, over 50 million people in Hubei Province have been restricted to their region as Chinese authorities try to prevent the spread of the virus. Wuhan’s public health authorities say they are in a “state of war” and public transport has been shut down in several Chinese cities. Cordoning off ground zero is not unusual in public health emergencies. An outbreak of norovirus or salmonella may lead to restaurant closure. In the case of the novel coronavirus, the wet market from where it may have originated (in Wuhan) was similarly shut down. Removing the suspected source of the disease is necessary but not sufficient. Any public health response to a disease outbreak must prevent transmission of cases to others. And while isolation is a well-established practice for individual cases, quarantining millions of healthy people is unprecedented in public health. Across Asia, facemasks are back in vogue, with Alibaba selling 80 million over two days alone. Given the historical context, this is unsurprising. The Chinese are well acquainted with outbreaks of viral disease. Crystalline memories of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have re-emerged. But it is this very context that raises the question: Is such a drastic response warranted? ILLUSION OF INTERVENTION   Some, looking in from the outside, may welcome mass quarantine. But in reality, it is no better than the usual public health response of isolating cases and potentially high-risk contacts of cases. Going further to isolate those who have any theoretical risk of disease may allay public fear and provide the illusion of intervention, but it cannot be considered an evidence-based practice. First, the argument for mass quarantine rests on the perilous assumption that one person’s risk of infection is the same as another’s, simply because they live in the same region. We know this is not the case, particularly at an early stage in an outbreak, and that there are groups at higher risk who may be identified and targeted first before radical strategies that interfere with usual activities are considered. In fact, any impediment to the day-to-day functions of healthcare and other infrastructure can be a huge problem for disease control. Contact tracing, disease surveillance, public education and administering protective equipment, drugs or vaccines, rely on effective communication with hospitals, primary care, laboratories and other institutions, such as schools or nursing homes. Descending into a zombie-apocalypse scenario does not help in the operational coordination of complex cross-agency public health activities. Second, a Chinese public health response must protect those within the affected region as well as those outside it. The current position ignores the rights of healthy people in and around Wuhan.   If we assume all currently recorded cases are within the city of Wuhan (of approximately 11 million) and not the wider region, then we can conservatively estimate that over 99 per cent of people are not cases. While human-to-human transmission appears to be occurring, preliminary reports don’t suggest that this is a particularly infectious disease. For every one case, the WHO estimates that a further 1.4 to 2.5 (or an average of two) more people are infected. To put this in perspective, for measles, an estimated 12 to 18 people will get infected from a single case. So the vast majority of the population trapped in the region are not unwell and would be unlikely to get infected with an appropriate public health response. Such a geographical lockdown of this magnitude is not just superfluous but also introduces new health problems into the mix. The first week of quarantine has resulted in crowded hospitals, food shortages and the local economy grinding to a standstill. Amid such chaos, even the Chinese will struggle to prevent defectors from fleeing. Also, it is unclear when it would be possible to lift such a lockdown. HIGH PRICE TO PAY With cases increasing by the day, the quarantine looks like it is here to stay, but escalating economic and social pressures will loom large for decision-makers. Surely the billions the quarantine is costing the Chinese economy would be put to better use in developing new diagnostic, preventative or therapeutic technologies for the virus? A quarantine of this scale may create more problems than it solves. Other countries must be careful not to hastily imitate this if and when given the opportunity.

02 Feb 2020 12:37PM,Japan confirms three new cases of Wuhan coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TOKYO: Japan confirmed three new cases of the Wuhan coronavirus among evacuees from the Chinese city of Wuhan, including one who initially tested negative, the health ministry said on Saturday (Feb 1). It brings the country’s total number of confirmed cases to 20. One of the three, a man in his 40s who had symptoms such as fever and coughing, first tested negative for coronavirus, the ministry said. But the man, who was initially diagnosed with pneumonia, was later confirmed positive for the virus with an additional test, it said. The government plans to send another chartered plane mid-week or later to bring back Japanese nationals who are still in China’s Hubei province and its provincial capital Wuhan, where the disease is thought to have originated, the foreign ministry said on Sunday. Japan has emailed its citizens in the province to tell them of its plan, and is negotiating with China about Chinese spouses of Japanese citizens who also wish to travel to Japan, it said. The death toll in China soared to 304 on Sunday, with authorities reporting 45 new deaths from the previous day. There were 2,590 new confirmed cases in China, bringing the total to nearly 14,500.

05 Feb 2020 06:32AM,Commentary: Hot and humid weather may end the novel coronavirus – as well as the development of a vaccine,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Cases may fall sharply by May, when temperatures in China warm up, say Dr Jyoti Somani and Professor Paul Tambyah. SINGAPORE: The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that infected more people in China than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 has now spread across the globe. While we are learning more about the virus daily, questions are being raised about its rapid spread. One possibility is that this development could be related to climatic conditions. CLIMATE, WEATHER AND FLU SEASONALITY There is reason to believe that the seasonal pattern of novel coronavirus pneumonia may be similar to that of influenza infection and SARS, and thus cases may sharply fall by May, when temperatures in China warm up. In countries with temperate climates such as China and the United States, the flu season usually starts in December with a peak in January or February, after which cases decrease. SARS disappeared in the northern summer of 2003 and has not reappeared significantly since. This seasonality of influenza and other respiratory viruses in temperate countries is thought to be related to factors that affect infectiousness (person to person spread) such as the dryness of the air, ambient air temperature and possibly ultraviolet solar radiation. Human factors may also contribute to the spread of influenza during the colder winters since more time may be spent indoors, presumably in closer contact with other persons. The 2019-nCoV appears to be similar to other respiratory viruses such as influenza or the common cold (rhinovirus), which are spread by large droplets of saliva or phlegm from one person to another (either directly by cough or sneeze) or by contact. That happens when a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches his or her nose, mouth or eyes, inadvertently transmitting the virus. In fact, studies have shown that these respiratory droplets spread farther when the air is cold and dry. Studies done many years ago showed that the “regular” coronavirus (which is one of the causes of the common cold) can survive on surfaces 30 times longer in places with a temperature of 6 degrees Celsius compared to those where the temperature is 20 degrees Celsius and humidity levels are high. More recently, scientists from Hong Kong University (HKU) including Professor Malik Peiris and Professor Seto Wing Hong showed that low temperatures and low relative humidity allowed the SARS virus to survive much longer than they would in high temperatures and humidity.   The HKU team argued that this may be the reason warm and humid Southeast Asian countries did not have SARS outbreaks, unlike Hong Kong and Singapore where in their words, there is “intensive use of air-conditioning”. Thus, just as with influenza, the 2019-nCoV may slow down when the sun starts to shine more and the weather warms up in temperate and subtropical countries. LESSONS FROM SARS The SARS epidemic occurred 17 years ago and, since then, public health institutions, medical and laboratory science professionals, and the infectious diseases community are much better prepared to respond to novel and emerging infections globally. The improvements in communications and social media are undeniable. The genetic sequence of this new type of severe pneumonia in Wuhan was shared relatively early. This allowed countries all over the world to develop fast and accurate tests: These were not available during the initial weeks of SARS outbreak. Then, we had to depend on clinical examinations and contact tracing to determine who really was infected with SARS. Near the end of the epidemic, we were able to test everyone and we found out that we had actually missed a significant number of cases – these were only diagnosed after they had recovered. This has been the biggest difference in that now, low-resourced countries like Nepal and Cambodia are able to conduct relatively fast and accurate diagnosis on-site without having to wait for samples to be sent overseas. Given that the genetic information about the novel coronavirus was available even before countries had patients with the virus, many labs in advanced countries, including Singapore, are already working on blood tests for rapid detection and studying the immune response to help vaccine development. A trial to test anti-viral treatments has already been initiated in China and is being planned elsewhere. CONTACT TRACING AND TRAVEL BANS A basic public health approach to any outbreak is the use of contact tracing.   This means that for any patient who is found to be ill, close family members and other persons that he or she had close contact with during the incubation period will be notified that they were exposed to a sick person and quarantined for a further full incubation period, which for this novel infection is indicated to be 14 days. During the Ebola virus outbreak of 2014, this type of contact tracing was done very manually in many settings, although there were a number of mobile applications which were piloted. For this 2019 virus infection outbreak, much effort is being placed on high-tech contact tracing. It is too early to tell if this will be more effective, but any method to help contacts monitor themselves during the incubation period and detect symptoms may certainly help to decrease community transmission. Public health measures including screening and quarantining are similar to what was done for SARS and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), although there have been broader approaches to travellers without direct contact with infected patients because of the extent of community spread in China. Given that we are not sure as to what extent asymptomatic persons can transmit the virus, many countries have decided to close their borders to Chinese nationals, as they cannot rely on temperature screening to detect who is potentially contagious and necessitating quarantine. Many countries are also quarantining their own citizens and permanent residents returning from China, in an effort to limit introduction of this virus into the community. During SARS, the World Health Organization (WHO) imposed global travel restrictions and advisories. When a travel restriction is in effect, a country may feel the need to quickly get the ban lifted and reduce its aggressive screening and case finding. This may have contributed to the resurgence of SARS in Toronto after the initial period of good control. This time round, different countries have introduced their own travel restrictions which are probably more appropriate to the different situations and their relations with China. Travel bans are always controversial as they tend to have significant unintended consequences and have to be actually instituted before the virus appears in the country. Otherwise, they are relatively pointless. Among the concerns about the travel bans instituted this time during the coronavirus is the fact that we do not know how extensive the spread is from people without symptoms.   If this is really very widespread, then a blanket travel ban will have limited effects by now as the virus is probably silently spreading among and through most countries. Once there is documented local transmission in a country, as in Germany and the United States, the goal has to be containing the local transmission while at the same time preventing re-introduction of the virus. Overall, the key strategy has to be good contact tracing and widespread testing so that every case can be identified, tested and treated. That way the chain of transmission can be broken and the virus stopped in its tracks even before the warm weather kicks in. VACCINES AND DRUG TREATMENTS Unfortunately, the current way in which drug and vaccine development in modern medicine happens is very much driven by financial considerations. Unlike for example defence or homeland security, the question that always comes up when it comes to treating and preventing human disease is: “Is this financially viable?” As SARS disappeared 17 years ago and MERS has only occurred sporadically, primarily in the Middle East, there has been no incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to invest the funds needed to develop appropriate drugs and vaccines. All the interest and enthusiasm which came with SARS disappeared when the virus did not reappear after a couple of seasons. Governments had other priorities and most have actually left this part of national security to private industry. Hence, if and when the novel coronavirus disappears in May and does not reappear next October or November, we can predict that drug and vaccine development will likely die a natural death. That is unfortunately the way of the world and hopefully something can be done to change this. But that will require a massive global mindset change. Given the frequency with which these emerging viral infections occur, the world can ill- afford to continue along this road.

01 Feb 2020 05:31AM,Nearly 200 Americans airlifted from China placed under coronavirus quarantine,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners WASHINGTON: Nearly 200 Americans evacuated from China and voluntarily confined to a California air base for 72 hours of coronavirus screenings were placed under a mandatory 14-day quarantine on Friday (Jan 31), as US health officials intensified precautions against spread of the disease. The move by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), its first quarantine in 50 years, was announced a day after the State Department issued its strongest warning against travel to China due to an epidemic of the new virus, which has claimed more than 200 lives. ""We are preparing as if this is the next pandemic, but we are hoping that is not the case,"" said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center For Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, in a telephone interview from the agency's headquarters in Atlanta. The United States angered China on Friday after it issued a travel warning over a coronavirus epidemic that has been declared a global emergency and led to increasing supply problems for businesses. Originating in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the flu-like coronavirus first identified earlier this month has resulted in the deaths of 213 people in China, out of a total number of cases approaching 10,000. The quarantine order requires all 195 Americans airlifted from Wuhan to remain isolated in special housing at March Air Reserve Base near Los Angeles for the entire 14-day incubation period of the disease. The two-week period runs from the time they left China on Tuesday. ""This is a precautionary and preventive step to maximize the containment of the virus in the interest of the health of the American public,"" the CDC said in a statement. SCREENING TEST LIMITED The CDC said on Wednesday, the day the evacuees landed, that they were being kept, on a voluntary basis, at the base for at least 72 hours while they underwent medical evaluation for symptoms of the virus and CDC laboratory tests. The plan then was to allow the passengers to return to their homes, absent any indication of exposure or illness, leaving state and local health authorities to continue monitoring the evacuees through the remainder of the incubation period. That plan would have permitted members of the group to take public transportation home. CDC officials said on Wednesday that people incubating the infection before symptoms appear are generally not regarded as contagious. But Messonnier on Friday cited emerging evidence that the virus can be spread by someone who is infected but not yet showing signs of being ill, which include fever, cough and other respiratory symptoms. The CDC also pointed to a limitation of the screening test it had developed for the virus. Even if a test result comes back negative, ""it does not conclusively mean an individual is at no risk of developing the disease over the likely 14-day incubation period,"" the agency said in a statement. “We are looking in people’s noses to see if they have the virus there,” but CDC is not certain the test is specific enough to identify whether someone is incubating the virus, Messonnier said. “This test is a point-in-time test that should not be relied on to predict whether this person will become ill.” TRIED TO LEAVE BASE The blanket 14-day CDC quarantine for all 195 evacuees was instituted after one of the passengers, who was not identified, sought to leave the base without permission on Wednesday night. He was immediately slapped with an individual quarantine order issued by Riverside County health authorities. It was not clear whether that incident played a role in the CDC's quarantine order on Friday. As of Thursday, none of the group at the base had exhibited signs of the disease, local health officials said. The evacuees, who were flown aboard a government-chartered cargo jet to California after a refueling stop in Alaska, consist of State Department employees from the US Consulate in Wuhan, their immediate family members and some other Americans who were welcomed to join the flight, the CDC said. The State Department said Friday it is working with US and Chinese agencies to arrange for additional flights of Americans out of Wuhan. Washington also plans to evacuate non-essential government employees and family members from the US Embassy in Beijing and consulates in Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenyang due to the coronavirus outbreak, a State Department official said on Thursday. The CDC has tallied six confirmed US cases of coronavirus, none fatal, including the first known transmission of the virus from one person to another within the United States - a couple in Illinois.

02 Feb 2020 04:24PM,"Wuhan coronavirus: Licence fees waived for hotels, travel agents and tour guides, cleaning costs subsidised","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Licence fees for hotels, travel agents and tour guides will be waived as part of measures to help the tourism sector in Singapore that has been “directly affected” by the Wuhan coronavirus, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) said on Sunday (Feb 2). STB will also defray the cleaning costs of hotels that provided accommodation to the confirmed and suspected cases of the coronavirus infections. These schemes are the first steps in a wider set of measures to help tourism businesses “mitigate the immediate impact” of the coronavirus outbreak, STB added.   These measures come after feedback from trade associations and chambers, said Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing. He said at the Oasia Hotel Downtown: ""I just want to assure the businesses and our workers that the survival of the businesses, and in the turn, the sustainability of the jobs for Singaporeans will be our primary focus."" Oasia Hotel Downtown was where Singapore's 13th confirmed case of the Wuhan virus stayed prior to being tested positive for the coronavirus. The 73-year-old arrived in Singapore on Jan 21 and developed symptoms seven days later. Mr Chan told reporters that Singaporeans should be ""mentally prepared"" for the impact of the coronavirus to be ""wider, deeper and longer"" than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. This is because China's trade with Singapore and its GDP have both gone up four times since then. ""What we must be mentally prepared for is that the impact of any disruption to the Chinese economy, to the supply chains, is likely to be much wider, much deeper, because of the interlinkages with the global economy - certainly with the Singapore economy,"" he said.   ""The tourism sector has already been directly affected by the novel coronavirus, due to a decline in visitor arrivals, especially from China,"" STB said in its media release on Sunday. Tourists from China account for about 20 per cent of Singapore’s total international visitor arrivals, with about 3.6 million visitors to Singapore in 2019, the tourism board added. Earlier this week, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong announced wider travel restrictions to include all new visitors – regardless of nationality – with recent travel history to China. These visitors will also not be allowed to transit in Singapore, as part of restrictions that came into effect at 11.59pm on Saturday. Those with Chinese passports, with the exception of Singapore permanent residents (PRs) and long-term pass holders, will also not be allowed to enter Singapore. All forms of new visas to Chinese passport holders have been suspended, and Singapore’s status as a visa-free transit facility has also been suspended for those with Chinese passports. HELP WITH CLEANING AND LICENCE FEES There have been 18 confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore. Of the 18, 16 are travellers from Wuhan and two are Singaporeans who were evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30. The tourism board said hotels that provided accommodation to suspected and confirmed cases will get help with their environmental cleaning and disinfection costs. “STB will cover up to 50 per cent of third-party professional cleaning fees, capped at S$20,000 per establishment for hotels with confirmed cases; and S$10,000 per establishment for hotels with suspected cases,” the board added. This will be backdated to Jan 23, when the first confirmed case in Singapore was detected. Licence fees for hotels for the rest of 2020 will also be waived by the Hotels Licensing Board. “Similarly, travel agents and tourist guides whose licences are due for renewal in 2020 will not need to pay to renew their licence fees,” STB said. Chief executive of STB Keith Tan said: ""Over the past week, STB has been in close contact with our tourism partners to understand their difficulties and to assess the impact. ""We know the situation is likely to persist, and recognise we need to move quickly to support the industry and build confidence. ""STB will continue to identify targeted and effective ways to support the tourism industry so that they are well-positioned to grow swiftly once we start to recover."" Full details of the overall package of relief measures will be announced at Budget 2020 on Feb 18.   The Government is ""keenly aware"" that some front-line workers are ""particularly worried"" about coming into contact with unwell guests or customers, added Manpower Minister Josephine Teo. She said that the Singapore National Employers Federation and the Singapore Business Federation will issue an advisory to employers with such workers. ""(The advisory will explain) what they can do to provide these workers with support. They need guidance on how to deal with unwell customers, and the advisory will give some specific suggestions,"" she said. Workers who are placed on leave of absences are not unwell and should not be evicted by landlords, co-tenants or dormitory operators, added Mrs Teo. There have been reports of such evictions, Communications and Information Minister S Iswaran had said on Friday. ""There's really no need to do so. It is completely unhelpful. And this is a time where we actually need to provide care and support to each other,"" Mrs Teo said. She noted that placing workers on leave is an extra precaution to minimise social contact. ""We must always be mindful that even as we take these extra precautions, we should be supportive to the people who are affected by the leave of absence,"" she said.

11 Feb 2020 09:21PM,Indonesia says nothing to hide after no coronavirus cases detected,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners JAKARTA: Indonesia is not hiding anything over the coronavirus, the health minister said on Tuesday (Feb 11), after some medical researchers expressed concern that cases may have gone undetected in the world's fourth most populous country. While the virus has quickly spread from China throughout much of the rest of the region and beyond, the sprawling Southeast Asian country of more than 260 million people has not recorded any cases so far. Dozens of cases have been recorded in other regional countries including Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines, where one person has died, raising suspicions on social media in particular over a potential lack of vigilance in Indonesia. Researchers at the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health, in the United States, then said in a study last week that Indonesia should rapidly strengthen outbreak surveillance and control - especially given that it had direct flights from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus. The Harvard team said that Indonesia's lack of confirmed cases ""may suggest the potential for undetected cases"" as air travel may contribute to cases being exported from China. The virus has killed over 1,000, with more than 42,000 confirmed cases in China and 319 cases in 24 other countries. Many of the cases outside China have been in people who have a history of travelling to the country. ""We have the kits to check coronavirus and they're certified ... Nothing is concealed,"" Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto said after a cabinet meeting at the Bogor presidential palace outside Jakarta, in response to the concerns. Indonesia has tested 64 samples from suspected coronavirus infections - 62 of which were declared negative with two still being tested, health ministry Research and development agency head Siswanto said during a tour of its laboratory in Jakarta. Navaratnasamy Paranietharan, the WHO's Indonesia representative, told a conference on Tuesday: ""Indonesia has taken concrete measures and the World Health Organization is quite confident that Indonesia is ready to be able to respond to this situation."" Indonesia has barred entry to visitors who have been in China for 14 days and stopped all flights to and from there. Vivi Setiawaty, another health ministry official, said it was unclear why Indonesia had not seen any cases but said authorities were better prepared since facing H5N1 avian influenza from 2005. ""We remain cautious,"" she told reporters. Indonesia has readied 100 hospitals across the archipelago including three in Jakarta and has also quarantined more than 240 of its citizens evacuated from Hubei province, home to Wuhan, to the island of Natuna, north of Borneo. The WHO's Paranietharan said it appeared unlikely, as some have suggested, that the hot tropical climate could be a factor in curbing cases though more data would be required to be sure. ""It doesn't make sense at this point whether that could be the reason why we don't have coronavirus cases in Indonesia,"" Paranietharan said.

04 Feb 2020 12:04PM,How luxury brands in Singapore are coping with the novel coronavirus outbreak,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners CNA Luxury reached out to several luxury brands across various sectors to find out what measures have been taken and how brands are dealing with the situation. Here’s what we found. The World Health Organization has declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency, as the number of cases worldwide continue to climb. As of Feb 4, Singapore has a total of 18 confirmed cases, the fourth highest in the world after China, Thailand and Japan. As public fear continues to grow, CNA Luxury contacted several luxury brands across the horological, fashion, F&B and hospitality industries to discover precautionary measures that have been put in place. Many were not forthcoming in providing answers, citing reasons such as sensitivity of the issue and corporate policy restrictions. Those who did respond cited measures such as stepping up hygiene procedures and health checks among guests and staff. And while the novel coronavirus outbreak has prompted the cancellation of some festivities, major events such as the Singapore Airshow is set to go on as scheduled, although some private jet companies have announced their withdrawal from participation. HOTELS RAMP UP TEMPERATURE CHECKS, HYGIENE PROCEDURES With travel restrictions in place in several countries, including Singapore, the hospitality industry is expected to take a hit from the outbreak. Hotels in Singapore are stepping up preventive measures to minimise the risk of transmission. These include intensifying hygiene procedures and implementing temperature checks. In response to queries by CNA Luxury, Accor, which operates several luxury hotels in Singapore including Raffles Hotel, So Sofitel Singapore and Swissotel, said in a statement, “The safety and wellbeing of our guests and staff is our highest priority. We have instructed all our hotels to implement measures to minimise risk of transmission. As a precaution, our hotels in Singapore have carried out additional hygiene procedures including cleaning and disinfection, as well as other measures recommended by the Ministry of Health.”   Similarly, at Marina Bay Sands, cleaning and disinfection of public areas and common touch points have been intensified. Surgical masks and hand sanitisers have been made available for guests. “We have also displayed public advisories at key locations on property to identify visitors from Hubei Province and those who may be feeling unwell. We have also progressively deployed temperature screening measures on property, starting with the Casino and Hotel,” said a Marina Bay Sands spokesperson. For IHG, which manages InterContinental Singapore, Regent Singapore and InterContinental Robertson Quay, educating staff has also been a priority. “We have taken a number of steps in the last few weeks to raise awareness of the novel coronavirus with our hotel teams. Our hotels have been prepared on policies, procedures and preventive measures to minimise the risk, as well as the actions to take in the event of an occurrence at the hotel,” Michael Martin, General Manager of InterContinental Singapore and Regional General Manager of IHG Singapore and Batam told CNA Luxury. ""We have taken a number of steps in the last few weeks to raise awareness of the novel coronavirus with our hotel teams. Our hotels have been prepared on policies, procedures and preventive measures to minimise the risk, as well as the actions to take in the event of an occurrence at the hotel."" – Michael Martin CNY EVENTS CANCELLED, PRIVATE JET NO-SHOWS AT SINGAPORE AIRSHOW Following the recent holidays, several brands and companies were slated to hold Chinese New Year events, but the coronavirus has put a dampener on the celebrations. An EDM sent out by The Hour Glass communicated the cancellation of the company’s Lunar New Year celebrations scheduled for Feb 7 at its Knightsbridge flagship store. According to the EDM, the yearly affair, which sees the gathering of watch enthusiasts and collectors, was cancelled“as a precautionary measure in line with preventive efforts taking place across Singapore and the region”. However, February’s much-anticipated public exhibition, the Singapore Airshow 2020, is scheduled to go on. But this is without the presence of at least two of its biggest private jet exhibitors, which will no longer attend. Canadian aircraft manufacturer Bombardier told CNA Luxury that the company has pulled out of the show. A report by Reuters also stated that American aircraft company Gulfstream will not be exhibiting. The decision was “a precautionary measure to protect the health of employees”, the report said. TEMPERATURE CHECKS, FORCED LEAVE AT RESTAURANTS AND SPAS Over at restaurants Bochinche and Noka, daily temperature checks for staff have been implemented, said Chua Koon Beng, CEO of parent company Spa Esprit Group. “Any staff who has travelled to select China cities have to be on forced leave for 14 days after they return to Singapore,” Chua added.   The Spa Esprit outlets, which offer services such as massages, facials and other beauty treatments, will also not accept customers who have travelled to China within the last 14 days or who are feeling unwell. While the group expects a drop in customer count for its beauty brands, it remains confident that this drop will not be too significant a number. “We have clear protocols set in place to protect both our staff and customers. Furthermore, our brands are known for their high level of service standards, especially our strong focus on hygiene,” said Chua. Chua believes that the climate of fear, which is keeping people at home, will dissipate in a few weeks, “and soon it will be life as we know it. We can trust our authorities to step up the immigration checks and reduce imported cases as the first line of defence which we know is already in place,” he said.

07 Feb 2020 06:05PM,"Chinese aerobatics team took ‘stringent’ health tests, also concerned about coronavirus in Singapore: Ng Eng Hen","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The Chinese aerobatics team underwent “stringent” health checks to ensure they met Singapore’s criteria before being cleared to perform at the upcoming Singapore Airshow, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen on Friday (Feb 7). The People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) Ba Yi team is also “just as concerned” about the coronavirus outbreak in Singapore, Dr Ng told reporters on the sidelines of a visit to the Changi Airbase where he met some participants of the aerobatics display. “The PLAAF had taken extra precautions for every member of their delegation that meet our criteria to make sure that they are healthy, well and they’ve passed all health checks,” he said. The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) had revealed on Thursday that the Ba Yi team will go for regular health and temperature monitoring during its stay in Singapore. This comes after the public expressed concerns about their participation in the airshow, given Singapore’s travel restrictions on visitors from China. “I think it’s natural to be concerned, and they are just as concerned as us because we have cases here,” Dr Ng said. “In fact just like other pandemics, whether it’s SARS or H1N1, once it goes to the community you can get it from anywhere. “But we had been very careful, and the PLAAF has been particularly careful that they observe all requirements that were needed to be healthy, and they underwent stringent tests so I’m very thankful for that.”   Dr Ng said MINDEF stands by the health and travel measures recommended by the multi-ministry task force and public health experts tackling the outbreak. Likewise the PLAAF, as with the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), is “concerned about the virus spreading within their own ranks”, he continued. “Like the SAF, they are making preparations to make sure that if there’s an outbreak, we can either prevent or limit the extent of the outbreak even within our military troops,” he explained. “Because if you have a situation where your military troops are sick, you have an issue about national defence, so they have taken the necessary precautions and health checks and I was happy to meet them.” Dr Ng said the Ba Yi team has brought with them “military discipline” when in Singapore, highlighting that their presence here is supported by Chinese defence minister General Wei Fenghe.   He said he had extended an invitation last year to the “famous” Ba Yi team to perform at this year’s airshow to commemorate 30 years of diplomatic ties with China. This was when he met Gen Wei last October to sign the Enhanced Agreement on Defence Exchanges and Security Cooperation with China. “So, I’m very happy that they are here and that they put in so much effort,” Dr Ng said, adding that the airshow will proceed “for the time being”. “Again, it’s a measure of how strong our relationship is. You know this phrase: Good friends stick through thick and thin.”   Nevertheless, Dr Ng said everyone is aware that many countries including Singapore are “grappling” with the outbreak. “As in previous outbreaks, whether it’s an epidemic or even a pandemic, there’s a life cycle to the viral attack,” he added. “We must be prepared for ups and downs, but at the same time, make sure that Singapore keeps going.”   During the visit, Dr Ng met and chatted with aircrew from the Republic of Singapore Air Force, the United States Marine Corps, the United States Pacific Air Forces and the Ba Yi team. Fighter aircraft from the two foreign forces will perform in the aerobatics segment of the airshow for the first time.   In particular, the US' fifth-generation F-35B, which Singapore was recently cleared to buy, will take to the skies together with its equally stealthy F-22. The F-35B can also land vertically and take-off from shorter runways. ""It's a phenomenal aircraft,"" F-35 pilot Lieutenant Colonel Michael Rountree, 41, said. ""Its capabilities are unique, it's absolutely game-changing. it's extremely flexible."" Lt Col Rountree said it was ""very significant"" that Singaporeans will be able to see its future jet perform in Singapore's airspace for the first time. ""We are very happy to be here to show these capabilities to you and hopefully strengthen our relationship with Singapore,"" he added.   After speaking to US, Dr Ng boarded a bus to where the Ba Yi team was assembled alongside its distinctive blue-and-red J-10 jets. Dr Ng clasped his palms and wished them a happy new year in Mandarin, before a crew member pulled over a staircase so he could climb into one of the jets.   The minister, who had taken a group photo with the entire crew, spent a few minutes in the cockpit. He thanked the team for being here, after which the meeting ended in warm smiles, claps and handshakes. “I told them to focus on the show,” he said. “It’s a high-end manoeuvre, high speed, (so I told them) to be strong, focused and I think they’ll put up a good show.”  It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

03 Feb 2020 06:21AM,"The Big Read: 17 years on, Singapore puts SARS lessons to the test in fight against Wuhan coronavirus","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners While the plans are in place and some measures have kicked in, Singapore’s national strategy is still largely untested - since the Wuhan coronavirus is believed to be in its early stages in the Republic, medical experts and SARS veterans said. SINGAPORE: Like many others on the frontline during the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic in 2003, the resources of a family clinic in Choa Chu Kang had been stretched thin. Personal protective equipment - N95 respirators, sterile gloves and full-body gowns - was scarce at a time when the world had never seen a virus like it, and people everywhere were desperately scrambling to stockpile emergency supplies for themselves. Dr Tan Tze Lee, a general practitioner at the Edinburgh Clinic, recalled the difficulties that frontline healthcare workers faced when procuring equipment to protect themselves from the killer virus. By the time SARS was contained in May 2003, it had infected 238 people and killed 33 in Singapore. Two in five of those infected had been healthcare workers. While Dr Tan’s clinic thankfully encountered no cases, it remained on high alert for SARS patients in the four months of the epidemic in Singapore, throughout which the medical staff had to don full protective gear. But everyone was not ready for the crisis, said Dr Tan, who is also president of the College of Family Physicians Singapore. Many continued to work but were extremely concerned that they might bring the virus home and put their loved ones at risk, he added. “The healthcare practitioners in Singapore were ill-prepared, which resulted in sombre outcomes. Since then, we have learnt our lesson and measures were instituted to prepare us for any future pandemic event.” “Here we are today, ready to fight the 2019-nCoV,” he said. The current outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus - or 2019-nCoV, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) temporary name for the virus - was first confirmed in Singapore on Jan 23. To date, all cases were imported, including a Singaporean who was in Wuhan, and there has been no evidence of community spread in the Republic. The WHO has yet to declare the virus - which has spread to several countries - as a pandemic. Nevertheless, it was declared a global health emergency on Friday (Jan 31). The first cases were reported in Wuhan in China’s Hubei province and believed to be linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which sells live animals. At the heart of Singapore's response plan is the Disease Outbreak Response System (DORS), a crisis management plan which did not exist in 2003, but was drafted after SARS and refined again in the wake of the swine flu (or H1N1) pandemic in 2009.   “After SARS, we made a thorough review of the facilities we had – the infrastructure, hospitals, isolation wards, and the scientific testing and capabilities,” said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week. “I think we are much better prepared now.” Currently, Singapore is at DORS condition (DORSCON) Yellow, signifying that the virus is severe and can infect from person to person, but is chiefly occurring outside Singapore. The next step up is DORSCON Orange, which would have applied in the case of SARS, whereby the virus is spreading in Singapore but not widely, and is being contained. While the plans are in place and some measures have kicked in, Singapore’s national strategy is still largely untested - since the Wuhan coronavirus is believed to be in its early stages in the Republic, medical experts and SARS veterans said. However, there are ample signs that the lessons from SARS are being applied as Singapore shores up its defences, they said. They believe that unlike during SARS, Singapore is far more ready now. LESSONS LEARNT Singapore has had two brushes with pandemics in recent memory - SARS and H1N1. While Singapore was able to contain and recover from both, the varying nature of the viruses, as well as the changes in medical science, meant that dealing with each required different approaches. Doctors had limited options when treating SARS patients and could only administer supportive care, and there was nothing that could be done to prevent infection. In comparison, vaccines and treatment options were available when H1N1 claimed 18 lives in Singapore and infected more than 400,000 people, out of which about 1,300 had to be hospitalised. COMMAND AND CONTROL SARS first arrived in Singapore in late February 2003, and was detected in a woman with an atypical pneumonia on March 1, 2003 at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). At the time, no one knew how deadly and virulent it was and the first patient led to a cluster of 42 cases at the hospital. A Ministry of Health (MOH) taskforce was set up on Mar 15, two weeks after the mysterious strain appeared in Singapore and three days after the WHO issued a global alert on the outbreak that began in Hong Kong. But the command and control structure then was “wholly inadequate” in a crisis situation that was both fluid and unprecedented, a study in the Austrian Journal of South-east Asian Studies concluded in 2012.   The structure was led by the health authorities, when in hindsight, it required “more than a medical approach since resources had to be drawn from a number of government agencies that did not fall under the rubric of the MOH”, said authors Allen Lai and Tan Teck Boon, who were from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. They noted that it took five weeks after the first case was reported for the bureaucracy to adapt, though by then, the outbreak had already spread quickly out of TTSH. On April 7, 2003, a national control structure was created in response to SARS, comprising a nine-member inter-ministerial committee led by then Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng to provide strategic and political directions during health crises. Helping to coordinate across silos were a core executive group of senior civil servants, and an operations committee spanning ministries. Their functions were later consolidated during the H1N1 crisis, which meant that this leaner bureaucracy was quicker to respond to emerging situations on the ground. With the Wuhan coronavirus, observers said that it was evident that the Government had reacted more quickly than in SARS and H1N1 when it came to establishing a multi-disciplinary decision-making body. Professor Ooi Eng Eong, an infectious diseases expert and virologist at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, noted that a multi-ministry taskforce on the Wuhan coronavirus was formed on Jan 22, several hours before the first suspected case came to the attention of the authorities at 10pm the same day. The patient - a 66-year-old Chinese national tourist from Wuhan - tested positive the next day, becoming the first confirmed case in Singapore. “If you look at the response time, it is a fact that the ministerial committee formed before the case appeared, and we can see that a lot of systems are already in place, occurring across ministries and not as siloed as back then when SARS caught us all by surprise,” said Prof Ooi, who is also deputy director of the Emerging Infectious Diseases Programme at Duke-NUS Medical School. The taskforce was formed to direct the whole-of-government response to the outbreak, coordinate the public’s response and work with the international community. Jointly chaired by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, the taskforce comprises a cross-section of Cabinet ministers spanning various portfolios. They are: Dr Chia Shi-Lu, a Tanjong Pagar GRC Member of Parliament who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health, said that this time, the chain of command is clearer. He noted that even before the taskforce was formed, the MOH had already begun tracking the outbreak in China at the start of the year. Temperature screening measures were put in place at Changi Airport from as early as Jan 3. But the high political signature of the panel had led some to question whether too many cooks were spoiling the broth, Dr Chia noted. “In fact, some have asked me: Are we overdoing it?” he said. “I believe it is very important for everybody to come into the picture - you have to, because at this early stage, (the outbreak) affects so many different parts and you need leadership from them, and you cannot rely solely on MOH to coordinate everything,” he added.  INFRASTRUCTURE, CASE MANAGEMENT AND ISOLATION While information about the Wuhan virus is still emerging, Singapore is not in the same position as in the initial stages of the SARS outbreak in 2003, where it was - in the words of then Health Minister Lim Hng Kiang - “flying blind”. During the SARS crisis, Singapore only had two means to detect those infected with the virus: Their clinical symptoms and their travel history. Detecting these were not easy at the time as temperature screeners were also a rare resource, unlike today. “We have to depend on people taking temperature, and we have to depend on people being truthful to us in their contact history,” said Mr Lim then, describing SARS as a tremendous challenge. Dr Tan Yia Swam, First Vice-President of the Singapore Medical Association (SMA), said that in the SARS crisis, “there were too many unknowns, and precautions came too late, and too slowly”. SARS was zoonotic in nature, with the disease starting in animals before spreading to humans. As a result, policies and procedures regarding risk stratification, contact mapping, contact tracing, quarantine and others were developed on the fly as the epidemic erupted, she said. “Today, all of the above have been developed and tested before in exercises and they are now put into action. Of course, these plans, policies and procedures must be modified in line with the epidemiology of the disease, but we are not working from scratch, unlike the past experience with SARS,” she added.   Addressing the media on Monday, Mr Lawrence Wong said that in the taskforce’s national response to the virus, it is able to “marshal all available resources” to tackle the scourge. In terms of capacity, Singapore has already beefed up its healthcare and isolation capacity since 2003. This includes the 330-bed National Centre for Infectious Diseases that opened last year, and new hospitals such as Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in 2010, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital in 2015, and Sengkang General Hospital in 2018, he said. During SARS, TTSH was known as “SARSCentral”, the designated hospital to handle patients. This was borne out of a policy to restrict transmission of the virus to other hospitals, after a patient - who was unaware that he had been infected with the virus during his stay in TTSH - created a new viral cluster at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) when he went there for a surgical problem after his discharge from TTSH. This policy changed in 2009 during the H1N1 outbreak, with the Health Ministry imposing a standardised infection control measure on all healthcare facilities, empowered by timely tweaks to the Infectious Diseases Act. More than 400 family clinics were made “H1N1-ready” and equipped with the Tamiflu vaccine to handle the outbreak.  Similarly, all public hospitals are capable of handling the Wuhan virus today, and come equipped with isolation rooms, which were in short supply in 2003. When it came to medical supplies, Dr Chia recalled how there was hardly a stockpile of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers then, such as N95 respirators. “Because an N95 mask needs to fit well for it to perform its function, having a properly fitted mask was (hard to come by) during SARS, and we had to find time to do the fitting too,” said Dr Chia, who was an orthopaedic surgeon at SGH at the height of the crisis. “Today, most of us are already fitted with our own personal equipment, even as new staff. Everything is in place today,” he said.   For the general public, the Government will be disbursing a pack of four surgical masks to each of the 1.37 million Singapore households in a one-off exercise between Feb 1 and Feb 9. This was also done in 2003 when all households received a free emergency kit, containing N95 masks and themometers. This time round, the mask distribution comes amid long queues at pharmacies around the island as people clamour to buy masks, and retailers say their stocks of surgical masks and N95 masks are running low or sold out. The Government had released 5 million masks from its stockpile over nine days to the retailers but they were all snapped up in hours. Said Dr Chia: “The message is that there is enough for the whole of the population and in reserve too.” SMA’s Dr Tan said his association met with the College of Family Physicians Singapore over the Chinese New Year weekend to carry out “complex logistics arrangements” to ensure that there is a steady supply of surgical and N95 masks to replenish stocks for the frontline healthcare workers. “We are all monitoring the situation closely, and are ready to step up efforts when the need arises,” he said. Experts noted that contingency plans have been put in place too - student hostels are converted into quarantine facilities in anticipation of future cases, and the Outward Bound Singapore on Pulau Ubin has been marked as a possible quarantine site.   TRICKY BALANCE IN THE FACE OF IMPONDERABLES On Monday, Mr Lawrence Wong also called on Singaporeans to be psychologically prepared that the Wuhan virus could be worse than SARS given the many “imponderables” and “uncertainties” regarding the infection, though he stressed that there is still no evidence of community spread of the disease in Singapore. Over the past week, however, the first reports of human-to-human transmissions outside of China have surfaced in Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam and Germany. Mr Lawrence Wong said Singapore’s approach “is to anticipate and move as swiftly as we can”. “But every action we take really has to be based on evidence, data and international medical guidelines,” he added.  Unlike SARS, which impacted Singapore when little was known about it, there is now a greater understanding about the coronavirus, a family of viruses that include the Wuhan strain and SARS. But data gaps still exist, said Professor Tikki Elka Pangestu, a visiting fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and a former director of the WHO’s research policy and cooperation department in Geneva. Prof Pangestu said that not much is known of the proportion of mild and asymptomatic cases versus the severe and fatal ones, which currently makes it difficult to evaluate the Wuhan virus’ true epidemic potential and complicates the outbreak response. There is also the worry that the virus could mutate into a more virulent and more highly transmissible strain. “This needs close monitoring and another data gap will be in how quickly this development can be evaluated,” he said. Despite these gaps, Singapore has “reacted much more swiftly and comprehensively” than in 2003, Prof Pangestu added.   A rule of thumb for any country’s approach in health crises, he said, is to base decisions on scientific evidence and rational analysis in the context of its own capacities. “I think the Singapore approach is the correct one given the current information and evidence available - robust but not over-reactive and flexible enough to accommodate new developments,” said Prof Pangestu. He noted that overreaction risks imposing an unjustifiable burden on the country, potentially impacting normal daily routines and the livelihoods of certain vulnerable segments of the population. Under-reaction, on the other hand, would lead to a more extensive spread of the virus. “Calibrating the balance is tricky, but as I said, base your decisions on the existing scientific evidence,” said Prof Pangestu. Prof Ooi from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health added: “There is a risk and cost to overreaction and a cost to an under-reaction. Nobody knows what is the right answer and there is no hard science to it - this is a judgement call and there is no right or wrong.” Where there is a dearth of knowledge on imported pandemic cases, Singapore’s national strategy is flexible with the changing circumstances, and the plan recommends taking border control measures that would “err on the side of caution with more intense efforts until such time when the disease profile becomes clearer”. Addressing the media on Friday, Mr Lee said: “I think as a Government, in a way, we are overreacting because we are trying to look ahead to see what can go wrong and take preemptive steps to prevent that from happening.” Within a week, the taskforce moved from allowing travellers from Wuhan to enter Singapore while subject to enhanced screening on Monday, to imposing a complete entry ban on all nationalities who have been to China in the past 14 days on Friday. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority has also stopped issuing all forms of new visas to those with People’s Republic of China passports. HANDLING A PSYCHOLOGICAL CRISIS Although the memory of SARS may have faded for some, experts say that the psychological lessons from it have remained until today, such that more Singaporeans are aware of the need to cooperate with the authorities during a health crisis. For example, social media is rife with examples of Singaporeans calling out bad actors, such as online sellers who hoard surgical masks to resell, or profiteering behaviour by certain businesses. The Government has also acted quickly to combat such behaviour. But Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, believes that the SARS legacy can also be a double-edged sword: The prospect of another SARS-like epidemic might lead to needless panic, or worse, “kiasuism”.   In a viral outbreak, being “kiasu” means that people only think for themselves, preventing mutual cooperation from happening, he said. Urging Singaporeans to do better, Dr Leong said they should be prepared for the viral outbreak but not overdo it. If fear and panic take hold, they can overwhelm the country’s response “like a tsunami”, he said. This means Singapore’s national response has to preemptively address concerns that could lead to panic, he said. “You have no time to get ready. Better to be ready (for the worst) now than not ready at all … There is little room for mistakes (that create more panic),” said Dr Leong.  Dr Chia believes that Singaporeans are generally behaving in a rational way so far, based on his conversations with residents as an MP or his interactions with patients. “During SARS, there was a lot more fear and a sense of real danger for everyone. We had people trying to evade quarantine, refusing to cooperate or going for medical screening … But so far there are no cases of people who are trying to evade authorities, in other countries, yes, but not among Singaporeans,” he said. The rise of social media, which was non-existent during SARS , can also give rise to disinformation that fuels further panic. On the threat of fake news, SMA’s Dr Tan said: “Social media may do more harm than good in this kind of situation where fake news may spread faster than a virus and trigger unwanted behaviours. We urge all readers to exercise judgement when reading stories from various sources, and to keep referencing to official websites for accurate information.” STRONGER LEGISLATION Compared with the SARS crisis, Singapore has more legislative levers now to deal with fake news and anti-social behaviour - the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act being one of them. Lesser known are the many enhancements to the Infectious Diseases Act over the years since 2003, which give the authorities greater powers to enforce orders that were issued in the fight against a gazetted outbreak. The Act allows people who break home quarantine orders to be arrested without a warrant and to be jailed or fined on conviction. It was amended last year to allow officers to use “physical means” to enforce the order by bringing an absconder back to the place of isolation, in lieu of arrest. It also makes explicit that persons under legal orders that restrict their movement in Singapore, would not be allowed to leave the country, unless otherwise permitted. The breadth of such powers in Singapore gives the authorities the ability to ensure that evasion tactics, such as those described by Dr Chia, cannot happen again. The issue became such a problem during the SARS crisis that the health authorities had to resort to draconian measures, such as installing video surveillance cameras in the homes of people who were ordered to be quarantined. The lack of legal powers has created some difficulties for several foreign governments in dealing with the Wuhan coronavirus. Earlier this week, two Japanese citizens who were brought back to Japan from Wuhan on a chartered flight declined to go for medical screening when they landed in Tokyo. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told the Japanese Parliament: ""While quarantine officers did their best to persuade them to go for further tests, they refused, and unfortunately there is no legal basis to force them to do so."" MORAL SUASION AND IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC COMMS But over the longer term, evidence suggests that government measures such as quarantine and travel restrictions are not as effective as instilling a voluntary sense of social etiquette and responsibility among the people. Having a buy-in from the public is especially essential when the authorities need the people’s support to carry out certain measures, noted Prof Pangestu.   Prof Pangestu said: “You need the public’s cooperation for your measures to be successful, such as to follow good hygiene practices, be alert to any symptoms, promptly seeking healthcare, awareness of potential risks, and to counter the spread of misinformation on social media.” This will be critical during the “surge response” - when situational changes cause a sudden need for the authorities to ramp up its measures, such as activating quarantine sites that are being held in reserve. A lack of moral suasion would erase the ability for the Government to implement these measures, experts said. They noted how in Hong Kong, protesters bombed a general hospital and a residential building that the authorities had wanted to use as a possible quarantine facility. Over the past week, South Korean protesters - mostly residents - also used tractors to block access to facilities earmarked as quarantine centres in the cities of Asan and Jincheon, which are about 80km from Seoul. Experts said cooperation from the masses largely relies on public education as well as proper and accurate communication of risk, which is not always a guarantee considering the complex flow of information in a crisis situation that can lead to miscommunication. An April 2003 article in The Straits Times, ""All the right moves for SARSbut info’s a bit slow, no?"", by its then news editor Bertha Henson, described how the MOH was asked at a press conference to confirm a tipoff that SGH nurses might have SARS. The authorities said no, but it later emerged the next day that 21 SGH staff were on the SARS suspect list. “The kindest thing I can say about this sudden announcement is that the ministry gets its information later than the media,” wrote Ms Henson then. Referring to the incident, Professor Chee Yam Cheng, the current president of the Singapore Medical Council, wrote in a series of memos about SARS in 2003 that “quick dissemination of information - and accurate information - is almost as important as transparency in a health emergency”. Prof Pangestu believes that in general, Singaporeans are united and support what the Government is trying to do to contain the situation. “But public reaction is hard to control especially with fake news on social media. The idea that ‘perception is reality, anything is the truth’ often operates in this kind of (crisis) environment. That is why public risk communication is so important,” he said.

04 Feb 2020 06:22AM,Commentary: We know more about the novel coronavirus but uncertainty remains about how virus spreads,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners The viral spread of anxiety and bigotry is as dangerous as the virus itself, says NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health’s Clarence Tam. SINGAPORE: In the past week, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the epidemic of the novel coronavirus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. This has previously been done for epidemics of swine (H1N1) influenza, polio, Zika and twice for epidemics of Ebola in west and central Africa. Classifying the current epidemic as an international emergency signifies the need for a concerted international effort to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. This decision has been precipitated by a number of factors, including the dramatic pace at which the epidemic is evolving, the detection of cases linked to international travel in an increasing number of countries, and the growing recognition of disease clusters outside of China that have resulted from person-to-person spread rather than travel to Hubei province. MANY KEY UNCERTAINTIES REMAIN But there is still uncertainty about some key issues – how widely the virus will spread outside China, what impact this will have, particularly in countries with fragile health systems, and exactly how severe this illness is. What we know so far is that the virus seems less deadly but more transmissible than SARS. Of the hospitalised cases detected in China, about 2 to 3 per cent have died compared to SARS’ 10 per cent fatality rate. Of these, most had underlying health conditions that are likely to have contributed to their risk of death. There is also increasing evidence that the virus can be passed on by people with mild or no symptoms. A new study by German researchers published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday (Jan 31) found a cluster of cases from China and Germany in which the virus appears to have spread before patients showed symptoms. All these cases were reported to have mild illness.   It is likely that a much larger pool of people have been infected but are not recorded in official statistics, because they do not experience pneumonia-like symptoms. One study published on prestigious medical journal The Lancet estimates than more than 75,800 have been infected in Wuhan alone, with the virus expected to reach its peak only in April or May. A more conservative estimate by China’s Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control estimates 25,000 infected but projects that the number of infections will double every six days. These uncertainties pose challenges for containing the epidemic, if people can pass on the virus to others before they know they are infected and before they can be isolated. For most healthy individuals, the risk of dying from a novel coronavirus infection is low, although we should be particularly concerned about those with pre-existing health conditions. Studies have shown that the first few cases saw a majority of those infected to be above 50. SARS had a fatality of 10 per cent but that jumped to 50 per cent in people over the age of 50, explained Vineet Menachery, an immunologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch said in an interview with Quartz, suggesting that seniors are more susceptible because of a weaker immune system. THE EXPLOSION OF CITIES MAY EXPLAIN JUMP FROM ANIMALS TO HUMANS As we work to resolve uncertainties about the biology of this new virus, it is important to remember epidemics have an important social dimension borne out of human development – which have little to do with peculiarities unique to China. Of the six epidemics that have been declared international emergencies, five involved viruses that ultimately originated in animals, including the current novel coronavirus.   Viruses routinely jump between species. In the past, these jumps were more likely to happen when humans and animals came into contact in remote areas. It was more difficult for these viruses to gain traction in humans, because there were fewer people to pass the virus on to. But as epidemics of SARS and Ebola have shown, with human migration and greater urbanisation, when these viruses are introduced into large, densely populated cities, they can spread rapidly and with devastating impact. This is bad news when there are about 600 cities with a population exceeding 1 million people today. But the astounding rise of China has seen urbanisation rates explode – 60 per cent of its population today live in urban areas and this figure is expected to rise to 70 per cent in the coming decade. Together with increased human encroachment into animal habitats and the intensification of food animal production, the emergence of animal viruses capable of causing similar international emergencies may become the new normal. The larger lesson to take away is this: If we are to successfully prevent and control the threat of such future epidemics, we urgently need global investments in urban planning, robust health systems and biosecurity. MEANWHILE BEWARE THE FEAR AND ANXIETY STOKED With the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus, we have also seen the viral spread of misinformation.   The upside of the potential for social media to facilitate rapid communication of scientific knowledge and health information emerging from this epidemic is being challenged by its use that fuels anxiety, fear and hatred. Conspiracy theories, malware, unfounded rumours and bigoted opinions have grown. Pictures of restaurant and store windows in South Korea and Japan with signs saying, “No Chinese allowed” have gone viral on Twitter and other social media platforms. Much of this incites social tension, distrust in governments, health authorities and scientific evidence, and demonstrates extreme and disturbing prejudices on the basis of nationality and ethnicity. As countries implement stricter travel restrictions and social distancing measures in an effort to curb epidemic spread, there is a real danger that as a society we may be aiding the spread of hatred and xenophobia. By the end of the epidemic, thousands of people will have been placed in isolation and quarantine and millions will have had their movements severely restricted through no fault of their own. The vast majority of these individuals will turn out to pose little or no threat to others, but are being asked or ordered to temporarily forfeit their freedoms for the good of the wider community. We should not look upon these individuals with fear, hatred and distrust, but rather with gratitude, kindness and compassion. In time, we will bring this epidemic under control and lessen its impact on humanity, but in doing so we must not lose sight of what it means to be human.

07 Feb 2020 03:30AM,It's too early to say coronavirus peaking in China: WHO,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners GENEVA: The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday (Feb 6) it was too early to say that China's coronavirus outbreak was peaking, but noted that the country had recorded its first day of a drop in the number of new infections. The death toll from the virus in mainland China jumped on Thursday to more than 630, with more than 30,000 confirmed infections inside the world's second-largest economy. That number had risen by nearly 4,000 from Wednesday to Thursday. Dr Mike Ryan, WHO's top emergencies expert, said it was very difficult to make predictions on the course of the disease first reported in the central city of Wuhan in late December, noting: ""We are still in the middle of an intense outbreak. ""There are cycles of transmission, and we may see those cases increase in the coming days. But at least for the moment, things are stable,"" Ryan told a news conference. ""But 4,000 cases or nearly, 3,700 coronavirus cases confirmed in a single day, is nothing to celebrate and is certainly still a great worry,"" he said. There is a constant rise in infections in the epicentre of Hubei province, which accounts for about 80 per cent of cases, Ryan said, adding: ""But we haven't seen that same acceleration in provinces outside Hubei. And equally we haven't seen that acceleration in Hong Kong, Macao, in Taiwanese people either."" Earlier, the United States and China clashed over the issue of Taiwan's exclusion from WHO meetings, including the ongoing executive board, where it is represented by China, with Beijing accusing Washington of political ""hype-up"". ""It's hard to believe just two months ago this virus was unknown to us,"" WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters. ""We have already learned so much about it, we know its DNA, we know it can be transmitted from one person to another, we know that those most at risk are older people and those with underlying health conditions,"" he said. But there is still a lot to learn, including the source of the virus, its severity and ability to spread, Tedros said. Maria van Kerkhove, a WHO epidemiologist, said that the virus causes a ""full spectrum of disease"". ""You have mild cases which look like the common cold, which have some respiratory symptoms - sore throat, runny nose, fever - all way through pneumonia. And there can be varying levels of pneumomia, all the way through multiple organ failure and death,"" she said, calling for further study of mild cases and how easily they can spread the virus.

07 Feb 2020 08:52AM,Another 41 on cruise liner off Japan have new coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TOKYO: Another 41 people on board a cruise liner off Japan's coast have tested positive for the new strain of coronavirus, Japan's health minister said on Thursday (Feb 6). The new cases raise the number of confirmed infections on the Diamond Princess to at least 61, said Katsunobu Kato. Japanese authorities have tested 273 people on board the ship, which was quarantined after a former passenger, who disembarked in Hong Kong last month, tested positive for the virus. ""The results of the remaining 171 tests came out and 41 tested positive,"" Kato told reporters. ""Today they will be sent to hospitals in several prefectures, and we are now preparing for that. ""In total, out of 273 specimens, 61 tested positive,"" he added. There are more than 3,700 passengers and crew on the ship, which has been off Japan's coast since Monday evening. It docked in Yokohama on Thursday to resupply for a quarantine that could last until Feb 19. Twenty people who were earlier diagnosed with the virus have already been removed from the vessel and taken to hospitals. Testing was initially carried out on those who displayed symptoms or had come into contact with the former passenger diagnosed with the virus. But Kato suggested additional testing would now take place. Authorities will ""test those who are susceptible to illness, including elderly people and those with other ailments, as well as those who had close contact with the people newly diagnosed with the virus"", he said. There were no immediate details on how many people would meet those criteria or when the testing might take place. ""I WANT TO CRY"" Japan has already reported at least 25 cases of coronavirus aside from the infections on board the ship, and evacuated hundreds of citizens from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus emerged. A fourth evacuation flight carrying both Japanese citizens and non-Japanese spouses and those with other ties to the country arrived on Friday morning. Japanese authorities have said the ship's quarantine may last until Feb 19, with passengers required to stay inside their cabins in a bid to prevent new infections. Those on board have described their confusion and frustration as their luxury cruise descends into a nightmare. ""Just woke up from (a) sleepless night,"" wrote Yardley Wong, a Twitter user on board the ship.""Getting so emotional... I want to cry. ""David Abel, a British passenger who has been posting videos from the ship, said people were hearing information from media more quickly than authorities on board. ""It's not right. It's so unfair,"" he said. But he praised the efforts of crew members who are now struggling to deliver meals to thousands of passengers in their cabins. Those with inside cabins, which have no windows, have been allowed onto decks in small groups to get fresh air, but under strict conditions, including wearing a mask at all times when out of their rooms. ""The quarantine officials require that you avoid congregating in large groups and maintain a separation of at least one metre from each other when talking,"" the ship's captain said in an announcement on Friday morning. ""We require that you wear as a minimum, warm clothing, hat and a scarf if possible,"" he added. A second cruise ship carrying a passenger suspected of infection with coronavirus will not be allowed to dock in southern Japan, the government said Friday.

08 Feb 2020 01:28AM,Outrage grows over death of Chinese doctor who sounded coronavirus alarm,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING/SHANGHAI: A Chinese doctor reprimanded for warning of a ""SARS-like"" coronavirus before it was officially recognised died of the illness on Friday, triggering anger at the government. The death of Li Wenliang, 34, came as President Xi Jinping reassured the United States and the World Health Organization (WHO) of transparency and maximum effort to combat the virus. Beijing's communist leadership has sealed off cities, cancelled flights and closed factories to limit an epidemic roiling the world's second biggest economy to the alarm of global markets and businesses dependent on Chinese supply lines. The epicentre region of Hubei is in lockdown and the capital Beijing resembles a ghost town. Deaths in mainland China reached 637 on Friday, with a total of 31,211 cases, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva, warning of a worldwide shortage of gowns, masks and other protective equipment. ""For the last two days there had been fewer reported infections in China, which is good news, but we caution against reading too much into that,"" he told the WHO Executive Board. ""The numbers could go up again."" Virus concerns swiped world markets on Friday, but failed to stand in the way of the best week for stocks since June and the strongest for the dollar since August. With Chinese buyers rejecting shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) due to the epidemic, traders rushed to find alternative locations amid record low prices. US President Donald Trump, after speaking to Xi by phone, said China was showing ""great discipline"". ""Nothing is easy, but he will be successful, especially as the weather starts to warm & the virus hopefully becomes weaker, and then gone,"" Trump said on Twitter.   OPTHALMOLOGIST REBUKED Ophthalmologist Li was among eight people reprimanded by police in the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, for spreading ""illegal and false"" information. His social media warnings of a new ""SARS-like"" coronavirus - a reference to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which killed almost 800 people around the world in 2002-2003 after originating in China - angered police. China was accused of trying to cover up SARS. Li was made to sign a letter on Jan 3, saying he had ""severely disrupted social order"" and was threatened with charges. Social media users called him a hero and shared a selfie of him lying on a hospital bed wearing an oxygen respirator and holding up his Chinese identification card. One image showed the message ""farewell Li Wenliang"" etched into snow on a riverbank. ""Wuhan indeed owes Li Wenliang an apology,"" said Hu Xijin, editor of the government-backed Global Times tabloid. Rights group Amnesty International called his death a ""tragic reminder"" of how China's preoccupation with stability made it suppress vital information. There were signs discussion of his death was being censored. After briefly trending on Weibo, the topics ""the Wuhan government owes doctor Li Wenliang an apology"" and ""we want free speech"" yielded no search results.   ""UNACCEPTABLE STIGMA"" The virus has spread around the world, with 320 cases now in 27 countries and regions outside mainland China, a Reuters tally of official statements shows. WHO emergency expert Mike Ryan called out stigma being attached to the virus amid reports of Asians being shunned in the West. ""The unnecessary, unhelpful profiling of individuals based on ethnicity is utterly and completely unacceptable and it needs to stop,"" he said. The outbreak could have spread from bats to humans via illegal traffic of pangolins, the world's only scaly mammals, Chinese researchers said, sparking some scepticism. Two deaths have been reported outside mainland China, in Hong Kong and the Philippines, but how deadly and contagious the virus is remains unclear, prompting countries to quarantine hundreds of people and cut travel links with China. There were 41 new cases among about 3,700 people quarantined in a cruise ship off Japan, taking the total to 61. Chinese-ruled Hong Kong quarantined for a third day a cruise ship with 3,600 on board. And about two dozen sick passengers aboard a cruise ship that arrived off New Jersey in the United States were screened for the coronavirus, with four sent to a local hospital out of ""an abundance of caution,"" the local mayor said. The head of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice, Li Fuying, told reporters that people deliberately concealing contacts or refusing isolation could be punished with death.

31 Jan 2020 02:28AM,"US confirms first human spread of Wuhan coronavirus, tells citizens 'do not travel' to China","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners WASHINGTON: The husband of an Illinois woman diagnosed with coronavirus after returning from a trip to China has also become infected, marking the first known person-to-person transmission of the disease within the United States, health authorities said on Thursday (Jan 30). The latest Illinois case brought the tally of confirmed US coronavirus infections to six, none fatal, according to the Centers for Disease and Prevention (CDC), as the number of Americans potentially exposed to the virus and placed under medical observation continued to rise.  One of 195 US citizens evacuated from Wuhan, China, and voluntarily confined to a military base near Los Angeles for evaluation was slapped with a mandatory quarantine after trying to leave the facility, health officials there said on Thursday. The quarantine order, issued Wednesday night by the county health agency, requires the individual to remain at March Air Reserve Base for the full 14-day incubation period of the virus, rather than 72 hours as prescribed by the CDC to screen evacuees before they are released. None has shown any symptoms, a county health spokeswoman said. The quarantined person, whose identity was not disclosed, is complying with the order, she added. The first five known US patients are believed to have contracted the virus during visits to China, epicentre of the worldwide outbreak, whereas the newly diagnosed Illinois patient - confirmed by the CDC on Wednesday - was infected by his wife. ""This is the first case of person-to-person transmission in the US,"" said Dr Allison Arwady, a commissioner at the Chicago Department of Public Health. Even so, Arwady added, ""there is no local emergency"". The United States told its citizens Thursday night ""do not travel"" to China, raising its warning alert to the highest level because of the coronavirus epidemic. In issuing a level four travel advisory - up from urging Americans to ""reconsider"" travel to China - the State Department said it was acting after the World Health Organization declared the epidemic originating in the city of Wuhan an international emergency. In an updated travel advisory, the department said any Americans in China now ""should consider departing using commercial means."". It recalled that last week it had ordered the departure of all non-emergency US personnel and their family members from Wuhan. ""The US government has limited ability to provide emergency services to US citizens in Hubei province,"" the advisory said.   Concern about the new virus has mushroomed around the world as more cases turn up outside China. Health authorities still do not know how dangerous the virus is or how easily it spreads. The World Health Organization on Thursday declared the coronavirus outbreak in China a global emergency as cases spread to 18 countries. More than 200 deaths and nearly 10,000 cases have been reported in China, the vast majority in and around Wuhan, China, where it is believed to have originated in a market that traded in illegal wildlife. US RISK STILL SEEN AS LOW Airlines were facing mounting pressure by cabin crew to stop all flights due to unease about exposure to the rapidly spreading coronavirus, with American Airlines' pilots filing a lawsuit seeking an immediate halt. The Illinois Department of Public Health said it was tracking 21 people who had contact with the infected Illinois couple, both in their 60s. Officials said the husband had not recently taken public transportation or attended any large gatherings. He has been in isolation the past two days after showing symptoms and was immediately hospitalised, Arwady said. CDC experts said they were not surprised by the development and that further person-to-person cases were likely to emerge. ""We understand that this may be concerning, but based on what we know now, we still believe the immediate risk to the American public is low,” CDC director Dr Robert Redfield said in a release on Thursday. Following the airlift of State Department employees and other Americans from Wuhan, Washington also was evacuating non-emergency government employees and family members from the US Embassy in Beijing and consulates in Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenyang due to the coronavirus outbreak, a State Department official said on Thursday. The department also will charter additional evacuation flights from Wuhan, leaving on Monday or sooner, it said in a statement on its website.

05 Feb 2020 12:12PM,3 new coronavirus cases in South Korea; 2 men had travelled to Singapore for conference,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SEOUL: South Korea has confirmed three more cases of the novel coronavirus, including two men who had attended a business meeting at Singapore's Grand Hyatt hotel last month. South Korean media reported that they were in Singapore for work and came into contact with a Malaysian who has since tested positive for the virus. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said on Wednesday (Feb 5) that the 17th case, a 38-year-old Korean man, visited Singapore for a conference from Jan 18 to Jan 24.  The man had a meal with the Malaysian man, as well as several other South Koreans during the conference, reported newspaper Joongang Ilbo. The 38-year-old developed a fever two days after he returned to South Korea, Korea Joongang Daily reported. He went to hospital, but was not classified as a suspected coronavirus patient as he had not been to China recently, said the report. However, he did not get better and went to two other hospitals. On Monday, he got a call from the Malaysian man who told him he had been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, reported the news outlet. The South Korean then contacted a community health centre on Tuesday and was subsequently taken to hospital. He tested positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday. The 42-year-old Malaysian man was the country's first citizen case of the novel coronavirus, bringing the total number of infected patients in Malaysia to 10. He was in Singapore from Jan 16 to Jan 23 for a business meeting at the Grand Hyatt Hotel that involved Chinese nationals. On Tuesday, Singapore authorities said that they were tracking the contacts of the Malaysian man, who developed symptoms on Jan 29 and subsequently tested positive for the novel coronavirus on Feb 3, nearly a week after he returned to Malaysia. Singapore’s Ministry of Health (MOH) said it has initiated epidemiological investigations and contact tracing to identify the individuals who had close contact with the case. South Korea's 18th case, a 21-year-old Korean woman, is a daughter of the 16th confirmed case in South Korea. While in isolation, she tested positive on Wednesday. Epidemiological investigation and contact tracing are underway, said the KCDC. On Wednesday evening, South Korean authorities confirmed another case of the virus, taking the country's total to 19, local media reported. The latest case, a 36-year-old man, had attended the same conference in Singapore as the previously confirmed 38-year-old South Korean man, reported The Korea Herald. He too had come into contact with the Malaysian who tested positive for the virus. A spokesman for the Grand Hyatt Hotel confirmed that the Malaysian had stayed at the hotel for a week in mid-January but he did not comment on meetings held at the hotel. The hotel has been deep cleaned and it is not aware of any other cases among its hotel guests or staff, he said. In an update on Wednesday, MOH said the Jan 20 to 22 meeting was attended by 109 participants from one company. Of those, 15 were Singapore residents and 94 were from overseas, said MOH. All of the overseas participants have left Singapore and MOH has informed the relevant health authorities, it said. The number of confirmed infections in China's coronavirus outbreak has reached 24,324 nationwide with 3,887 new cases reported, the National Health Commission said. The disease is believed to have emerged in December in a Wuhan market that sold wild animals, and spread rapidly as people travelled for the Chinese New Year holiday in January. The novel coronavirus has continued to spread with Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand on Tuesday reporting new infections that were not imported from China. CNA has reached out to Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more details on the South Korean patient.

14 Feb 2020 03:39PM,Dying a desperate death: A Wuhan family's coronavirus ordeal,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: There were no doctors, nurses or medical equipment at the Wuhan hotel converted into a temporary quarantine facility for suspected coronavirus patients when brothers Wang Xiangkai and Wang Xiangyou arrived two weeks ago. The next day, Xiangkai, 61, woke to find that Xiangyou, 62, had died. The Wangs are among tens of thousands of families devastated by the coronavirus in Wuhan, where the medical system has been overwhelmed by the outbreak, despite massive reinforcements and two speedily built new hospitals. ""What did we do to deserve such punishment?"" Wang Wenjun, Xiangkai's daughter, said over the phone to Reuters. A crematorium sent a car to pick up Xiangyou's body, but the family was told no mourning ceremony would be allowed. They could only collect his ashes after 15 days. Two days before Xiangyou died, doctors at the 4th Hospital of Wuhan had written in a diagnosis that both brothers were likely infected by the coronavirus which has now killed over 1,350 people in China. CT scans showed their lungs had turned ""white"" with patterns resembling cracked glass, symptomatic of severe viral infections. But the hospital did not have any RNA test kits to confirm their cases, and thus could not admit them for treatment, according to the doctors. They were told to contact their community government, which on Jan 30 offered to house the brothers at the hotel. Hubei province on Thursday reported a sharp rise in the number of deaths and cases after changing its methodology to include those diagnosed through CT scans like Xiangyou. More than 63,000 people have now been infected nationwide and 1,380 have died. Xiangkai, a retired cab driver, refused to remain at the Echarm hotel after his brother died, instead staying alone at a relative's home. His wife visited daily, bringing food and Chinese medicine, until she too fell ill with what doctors suspect is the coronavirus. Wenjun lives on the other side of Wuhan. Closed transportation lines means she is unable to visit her parents. Desperate for treatment for her father, she issued a plea for help on the Twitter-like Weibo. The community government responded, saying the decision was up to the virus taskface. At around midnight on Monday, the family received a call saying a hospital bed was available. With no public transport, Wang's 58-year-old wife pushed him in a wheelchair for the 10-minute trip to the hospital. A new CT scan showed Xiangkai's lung infection had worsened. He now has trouble walking to the toilet on his own and is awaiting the results of an RNA test. ""On Jan 22, our entire family had a Chinese New Year dinner, and we even took a photo together. It has been bad news every day since then,"" Wenjun said.

11 Feb 2020 06:00PM,No plans to cancel SAF in-camp training amid coronavirus concerns: Heng Chee How,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: There are no plans to cancel Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) in-camp training amid concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, Senior Minister of State for Defence Heng Chee How said on Tuesday (Feb 11). “We have to go back to the mission of the SAF and the defence of this country. We have to defend this country whether or not there is a virus situation,” he said. “That said, we must understand that when there is such a situation, we must take the necessary steps to safeguard the health of our soldiers. “This is exactly what we are doing – to make sure that both are top priorities.” The individual physical proficiency test (IPPT) will also not be cancelled at unit level.   “If they are sick, then they should let it be known so that we can then ask them not to undertake IPPT, (or) it can be rescheduled so that in the meantime you can seek treatment,” Mr Heng continued. Mr Heng was speaking to reporters at the Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC) on Pulau Tekong after observing stepped up measures against the virus outbreak. The centre, which currently has 5,000 recruits, has introduced measures like social distancing as well as increased frequency of cleaning and temperature-taking. This comes after some members of the public have written to the media urging ICTs to be suspended following local transmissions of the coronavirus.   “The very purpose of my visit today is indeed to give confidence to our soldiers and their families that there is no need to worry, that we understand the situation and that we have in place the measures, (which are) the same as those maintained on the mainland under the guidance of the MOH (Ministry of Health),” Mr Heng said. While Mr Heng stressed that BMTC does not have a confirmed case of the virus, he said suspected cases will be sent to the island’s medical centre, which has “exactly the same” standards and procedures as those adopted by MOH on the mainland. “If the doctor over here feels the patient fits the criteria that needs to be referred to the NCID (National Centre for Infectious Diseases), then that will be done,” he said. “Following that, we will do the necessary contact tracing as well as segregation of the close contacts for close monitoring.” SOCIAL DISTANCING The BMTC has also introduced staggered meal times and book-in and book-out timings to minimise interaction among servicemen. Each meal period has been divided into four timings to accommodate two companies of soldiers each. One company has 220 servicemen. Previously, more than four companies could eat during the same meal period.   BMTC has also cancelled or rescheduled physical activities where prolonged interaction is expected, like aqua jogging in the pool. In addition, it has deferred non-essential social activities like the recruits’ evening and external talks. Servicemen have been provided with stronger disinfectants like bleach and instructed to clean their bunks more frequently. SAF-chartered ferries and buses are also being cleaned more frequently. Similar measures have been implemented at all SAF camps. The centre is also considering reducing the number of public visitors at the next graduation parade in March and direct enlistment on Pulau Tekong in April.   During the H1N1 flu outbreak in 2009, BMTC reduced the number of visitors each servicemen could invite to their graduation parade from four to two. DORSCON ORANGE The measures come after Singapore on Friday raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange. The country has 45 confirmed cases of the coronavirus as of Monday. Under the new DORSCON level, organisers of large events should take necessary precautions such as carrying out temperature screening, looking out for respiratory symptoms like cough or runny nose, and denying entry to unwell individuals. BMTC has increased the frequency of temperature-taking for active personnel from once to at least twice a day.   It has also introduced an online health declaration form for visitors and contractors, with restrictions for those with recent travel to China. If the DORSCON level is raised to the maximum Red, the centre will align its measures with those introduced by the Ministry of Health. Mr Heng said: “We have also reminded every soldier to take good care of himself and herself to go see a doctor or let the commanders know when you’re feeling unwell.” CLEANING BUNKS While Recruit Zachary Ho said it’s definitely “quite a hassle” to have to clean his bunk more frequently, he acknowledged the rationale behind it given the virus outbreak. “As much as we hate it, we’ll do our best to try to reach every nook and cranny of the bunk to make sure it’s free of dust and bacteria,” the 18-year-old said. “We use the anti-bacterial wet wipes or bleach given to us to clean down the room as best as we can.”   Recruit Muhammad Syukri Sallehuddin, 18, said his parents were initially concerned for his well-being after the DORSCON level was raised and asked if the flu had been going around. “After knowing the measures, they were less worried,” he added. “The commanders really try to open up and ask us to let them know if we were feeling unwell.” The platoon commanders in charge of the recruits said they make it a point to enforce the increased frequency of cleaning to ensure the bunks are hygienic. Beyond that, Second Lieutenant John Pravin Kanesan, 22, said it was about being more open with recruits and telling them it’s fine to inform of symptoms and report sick. “After DORSCON Orange, what we have started thinking about more is to ensure that there’s an open culture of reporting whenever recruits are feeling sick,” he added.

07 Feb 2020 06:05PM,"Chinese aerobatics team took ‘stringent’ health tests, also concerned about coronavirus in Singapore: Ng Eng Hen","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The Chinese aerobatics team underwent “stringent” health checks to ensure they met Singapore’s criteria before being cleared to perform at the upcoming Singapore Airshow, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen on Friday (Feb 7). The People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) Ba Yi team is also “just as concerned” about the coronavirus outbreak in Singapore, Dr Ng told reporters on the sidelines of a visit to the Changi Airbase where he met some participants of the aerobatics display. “The PLAAF had taken extra precautions for every member of their delegation that meet our criteria to make sure that they are healthy, well and they’ve passed all health checks,” he said. The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) had revealed on Thursday that the Ba Yi team will go for regular health and temperature monitoring during its stay in Singapore. This comes after the public expressed concerns about their participation in the airshow, given Singapore’s travel restrictions on visitors from China. “I think it’s natural to be concerned, and they are just as concerned as us because we have cases here,” Dr Ng said. “In fact just like other pandemics, whether it’s SARS or H1N1, once it goes to the community you can get it from anywhere. “But we had been very careful, and the PLAAF has been particularly careful that they observe all requirements that were needed to be healthy, and they underwent stringent tests so I’m very thankful for that.”   Dr Ng said MINDEF stands by the health and travel measures recommended by the multi-ministry task force and public health experts tackling the outbreak. Likewise the PLAAF, as with the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), is “concerned about the virus spreading within their own ranks”, he continued. “Like the SAF, they are making preparations to make sure that if there’s an outbreak, we can either prevent or limit the extent of the outbreak even within our military troops,” he explained. “Because if you have a situation where your military troops are sick, you have an issue about national defence, so they have taken the necessary precautions and health checks and I was happy to meet them.” Dr Ng said the Ba Yi team has brought with them “military discipline” when in Singapore, highlighting that their presence here is supported by Chinese defence minister General Wei Fenghe.   He said he had extended an invitation last year to the “famous” Ba Yi team to perform at this year’s airshow to commemorate 30 years of diplomatic ties with China. This was when he met Gen Wei last October to sign the Enhanced Agreement on Defence Exchanges and Security Cooperation with China. “So, I’m very happy that they are here and that they put in so much effort,” Dr Ng said, adding that the airshow will proceed “for the time being”. “Again, it’s a measure of how strong our relationship is. You know this phrase: Good friends stick through thick and thin.”   Nevertheless, Dr Ng said everyone is aware that many countries including Singapore are “grappling” with the outbreak. “As in previous outbreaks, whether it’s an epidemic or even a pandemic, there’s a life cycle to the viral attack,” he added. “We must be prepared for ups and downs, but at the same time, make sure that Singapore keeps going.”   During the visit, Dr Ng met and chatted with aircrew from the Republic of Singapore Air Force, the United States Marine Corps, the United States Pacific Air Forces and the Ba Yi team. Fighter aircraft from the two foreign forces will perform in the aerobatics segment of the airshow for the first time.   In particular, the US' fifth-generation F-35B, which Singapore was recently cleared to buy, will take to the skies together with its equally stealthy F-22. The F-35B can also land vertically and take-off from shorter runways. ""It's a phenomenal aircraft,"" F-35 pilot Lieutenant Colonel Michael Rountree, 41, said. ""Its capabilities are unique, it's absolutely game-changing. it's extremely flexible."" Lt Col Rountree said it was ""very significant"" that Singaporeans will be able to see its future jet perform in Singapore's airspace for the first time. ""We are very happy to be here to show these capabilities to you and hopefully strengthen our relationship with Singapore,"" he added.   After speaking to US, Dr Ng boarded a bus to where the Ba Yi team was assembled alongside its distinctive blue-and-red J-10 jets. Dr Ng clasped his palms and wished them a happy new year in Mandarin, before a crew member pulled over a staircase so he could climb into one of the jets.   The minister, who had taken a group photo with the entire crew, spent a few minutes in the cockpit. He thanked the team for being here, after which the meeting ended in warm smiles, claps and handshakes. “I told them to focus on the show,” he said. “It’s a high-end manoeuvre, high speed, (so I told them) to be strong, focused and I think they’ll put up a good show.”  It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

06 Feb 2020 10:04PM,Condition worsens for 2 coronavirus patients in Singapore: MOH,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The condition of two coronavirus patients in Singapore has worsened, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Thursday (Feb 6). ""One is now in critical condition in the intensive care unit, and another requires additional oxygen support,"" it said in a press release. Two new cases were also confirmed by the ministry on Thursday, bringing the total number of cases in Singapore to 30. Both new cases are in a stable condition, MOH said. Among the earlier 28 confirmed cases, one has been discharged. Most of the other patients are ""stable or improving,"" MOH said. As of noon on Thursday, 310 of the suspect cases have tested negative for the coronavirus. Test results for the remaining 147 cases are pending, the ministry added. ONE PATIENT DISCHARGED SO FAR The first patient to be discharged was a 35-year-old man from Wuhan who was Singapore’s seventh confirmed case. He had been “comprehensively tested negative” for the coronavirus, the ministry said on Feb 4. His symptoms had “fully resolved” and consecutive tests over three days all came back negative, MOH’s director of medical services Kenneth Mak had told a press conference. The man had tested positive for the coronavirus on Jan 27. He arrived in Singapore four days before and went to Raffles Hospital after he developed symptoms on Jan 24. He was then transferred to NCID. Singapore on Saturday widened travel restrictions to stop all new visitors of any nationality with recent travel history to mainland China from entering Singapore. These visitors are also not allowed to transit in Singapore. The virus, believed to have originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has killed more than 560 people and infected more than 28,000, the vast majority of them in China. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the virus outbreak a global emergency.

06 Feb 2020 08:21AM,Ten more on cruise ship off Japan have new coronavirus: Local media,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TOKYO: Ten more people on a cruise ship off Japan have tested positive for the new coronavirus, local media said on Thursday (Feb 6), raising the number of infections detected on the boat to 20. Japanese authorities have tested 273 people among the approximately 3,700 passengers and crew members on the ship after a man who got off the boat last month in Hong Kong tested positive for the new strain.   The new cases were reported as the Diamond Princess, which was placed in quarantine off the Japanese port city of Yokohama on Monday night, docked to allow resupply and the removal of sick passengers. At the port, officials could be seen dressed in white full-body protective suits, complete with face masks and helmets. As the massive cruise ship docked, passengers who have been told they may have to stay aboard for 14 days even if they test negative for the virus, came out onto balconies, some waving to assembled media or taking pictures.   People on board have described confusion and boredom after being confined to cabins following the decision by Japanese authorities to quarantine the vessel. More than 20 countries have confirmed cases of the virus, which has infected more than 28,000 in mainland China and killed more than 560 people. The outbreak has prompted the World Health Organization to declare a global health emergency, several governments to impose travel restrictions, and airlines to suspend flights to and from China.   Japan has now confirmed 45 cases of the new coronavirus - including the cruise ship infections - among them citizens returning from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak. Tokyo has evacuated more than 500 Japanese citizens from Wuhan, and attracted some criticism for its relatively loose quarantine approach.   There have been several incidences of apparent person-to-person transmission in Japan, including a tour guide and bus driver who contracted the virus after coming into contact with visitors from Wuhan. Neither had visited China in recent months.

05 Feb 2020 07:59PM,Olympics: China coronavirus spread could throw cold water on 2020 Games - Chief,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TOKYO: The spread of a new coronavirus could throw ""cold water over the growing momentum of the 2020 Games,"" Tokyo Organising Committee CEO Toshiro Muto said on Wednesday (Feb 5). ""I am seriously concerned ... I hope this will be resolved as soon as possible,"" Muto said at a meeting in Tokyo with the organisers of the Paralympic Games. Japanese government officials including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have said the government would work hard to minimise any impact from the virus outbreak on the Games, which start on Jul 24. The death toll from the flu-like virus that originated in China's central city of Wuhan has passed 490, as two US airlines suspended flights to Hong Kong following the first fatality there and 10 cases were confirmed on a quarantined Japanese cruise ship. Vaccines against the virus probably won't be ready by the start of the Tokyo Summer Olympics, a professor who looked at health risks ahead of the Games told Reuters earlier, adding he hoped there was enough time to build defences. Saburo Kawabuchi, head of the athletes' village for the 2020 Olympics, said he hoped the games would proceed smoothly, free from the virus. Separately, Japan Sports Agency has started examining the impact of the virus on preparations by athletes for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, NHK reported. Several qualifying events including badminton and boxing have been postponed due to the virus.

18 Jan 2020 03:30AM,US to screen passengers for new China coronavirus at three airports,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners WASHINGTON: The United States will begin screening efforts at three U.S. airports to detect travelers from the central Chinese city of Wuhan who may have symptoms of a new respiratory virus that so far has killed two people and infected 45 more, public health officials said on Friday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the screening at the San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles airports will begin later on Friday and focus on travelers to the United States via direct or connecting flights from Wuhan. So far, the new virus has spread outside of China to Japan and Thailand, and CDC officials said in a conference call with reporters that they expect more cases will be reported outside of China. The risk to Americans is deemed to be low, the CDC said. Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, said in a conference call that the CDC will be sending about 100 additional staff to the three airports - Los Angeles International, San Francisco International and New York's John F. Kennedy International - to supplement existing staff at quarantine stations located at those airports. Under the screening procedures, travelers from Wuhan will be taken to a separate area in the airport, where they will complete a questionnaire and be checked for fever. Those with symptoms will be asked additional health- and exposure-related questions, and those needing more follow-up will be referred to a designated healthcare facility for more testing. The Chinese virus is a coronavirus, a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, a highly infectious virus that originated in China in 2002 and eventually traveled to 37 countries, killing 774 people. So far, health officials do not consider the new virus from China to be as lethal as SARS, but the investigation is evolving and much is still not known about whether the virus can spread easily from person to person. ""This is the stage of the investigation where we need to proceed cautiously and be prepared for any eventuality,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, a CDC expert in respiratory diseases, said on the conference call. China health officials report that most of the patients infected with the virus have had exposure to a large market where live animals were present, suggesting the virus is new and has jumped from animals to humans. It is still not clear how well the virus can be transmitted from person to person, but there are indications of some limited spread from person-to-person, CDC officials said. The World Health Organization earlier this week provided guidance to hospitals worldwide about infection prevention and control in case the new virus spreads. There is no specific treatment for the new virus, but anti-virals are being considered. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Copyright© Mediacorp 2020. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

07 Feb 2020 06:29PM,Precautionary measures stepped up at Victoria Junior College after teacher tests positive for novel coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Precautionary measures have been stepped up to help minimise the potential spread of the novel coronavirus at Victoria Junior College, after a teacher at the school was one of three newly infected patients in Singapore. The college will thoroughly disinfect the staff room, pantry and the teaching rooms the teacher was in, said Ms Liew Wei Li, director of schools at the Ministry of Education (MOE), at a media briefing on Friday (Feb 7). Co-curricular activities at the college have been suspended for two weeks with immediate effect, and instead of lectures there will be more “tutorial-size” classes, she said.  The 42-year-old Singaporean teacher first reported symptoms on Sunday and was admitted to hospital three days later, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). She had been absent from school for the past week on medical leave due to a high fever, and was last at school on Jan 31, MOE said in a press release. A few colleagues and students were in close contact with her and will be given 14 days’ leave of absence starting from the last day of contact, said Ms Liew. In a Facebook post on Friday night, Education Minister Ong Ye Kung said he spoke with the teacher on the phone, who told him that she ""felt bad"" over what has happened. ""I spoke with the teacher on the phone earlier this evening. She felt bad about what happened, but I assured her it was not her fault. What we are doing are necessary precautions to keep our schools safe. I also wished her speedy recovery,"" he said. Mr Ong also reminded the public of the enhanced measures that MOE has implemented, which include the suspension of inter-school and external activities. ""This is to reduce the mixing of students across schools and exposure to large crowds at public places,"" he said. ""We have also put in place a stringent hygiene regime, ensuring students and staff practise good personal hygiene, and also social hygiene protocols such as wiping down surfaces after use."" In the Facebook post, Mr Ong also said that parents asking for classes to be suspended was both ""drastic"" and ""unrealistic"". ""Some parents have suggested suspending schools. But this is a drastic move that will disrupt life for many families, and it is also not realistic to expect older children to stay home the whole time school is closed."" He also assured the public that MOE will continue to monitor the situation and take necessary steps ""to keep our people safe"".   Singapore on Friday announced three new cases of the novel coronavirus, taking the total number of people confirmed to have the virus in the country to 33. In addition to the teacher, the other two cases are a 53-year-old Singaporean man who had been in Malaysia on Jan 6, 11 and 17 and a 39-year-old Singaporean woman who had also been in Malaysia from Jan 22 to 29. None of the three new patients is linked to the existing cases or have been in China recently, said the health ministry. The Government also raised the risk assessment for the novel coronavirus outbreak from DORSCON Yellow to DORSCON Orange, introducing additional precautionary measures. These include the suspension of inter-school and external activities with immediate effect until the end of the March school holidays. All schools and teachers will also continue to implement previously announced enhanced measures such as classroom-based assemblies.   The novel coronavirus outbreak started in the Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei province, but has since spread to more than 20 countries. More than 600 people have died and at least 30,000 people have been infected with the disease, the vast majority of them in China.

01 Feb 2020 07:35PM,"Wuhan coronavirus: 2 new imported cases, no evidence of community spread, says MOH","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Saturday (Feb 1) confirmed two additional imported cases of the Wuhan coronavirus, bringing the total to 18 cases. Both cases have recent travel history to Wuhan and there is currently no evidence of community spread in Singapore, MOH added. ""The two new cases are stable currently, and we are continuing to monitor their health. As for the 16 previously announced cases, none is critically ill. All of them remain in stable condition, and most are improving,"" MOH said. The 17th case is a 47-year-old female Singapore citizen who travelled to Wuhan. ""She was one of the Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30, and arrived in Singapore on the same day. She was asymptomatic when she boarded the flight. ""Upon arrival at Changi Airport, she was found to have a fever during medical screening, and was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID),"" MOH said. The woman then tested positive for Wuhan coronavirus infection on Jan 31 at about 11pm. She is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID. The 18th case is a 31-year-old female Chinese national who arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 22. She tested positive for infection on Feb 1 at about 2pm and is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID. MOH said that it has initiated epidemiological investigations and contact tracing to identify individuals who had close contact with the cases. In an update on the 16th confirmed case, which was announced on Jan 31, MOH said the 38-year-old male Chinese national arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 22. He is currently warded in an isolation room at the Singapore General Hospital. The man reported that he was asymptomatic during his flight to Singapore and subsequently developed symptoms on Jan 23. He reported that he had stayed at his home at Nathan Road until Jan 29, when he took a taxi to SGH. He was classified as a suspect case and immediately isolated. Subsequent test results confirmed 2019-nCoV infection on Jan 31 at about 2pm, MOH said.  As of 12pm on Feb 1, MOH said 231 of the suspect cases have tested negative for the Wuhan coronavirus. Test results for the remaining 25 cases are pending and contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once identified, MOH said it will closely monitor all close contacts and quarantine them for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient as a precautionary measure. All other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status. So far, MOH said it has identified 245 close contacts. Of the 177 who are still in Singapore, 172 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining five close contacts.  MOH also advised Singaporeans to defer all travel to Hubei province and all non-essential travel to mainland China. ""All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell. ""Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (eg. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit,"" MOH said.  MOH added that it will continue to monitor the situation closely. ""As medical practitioners are on the lookout for cases with pneumonia who have recently been in China, Singapore is likely to see more suspect cases that will need to be investigated."" Singapore on Friday announced that it will widen travel restrictions to include all new visitors with recent travel history to China. China also said it will send charter planes to bring home citizens from Hubei who are overseas ""as soon as possible"". The announcement came as a number of airlines, including Singapore Airlines and Scoot, announced they were halting or reducing flights to China as the country tackles the spread of the virus. In a bid to contain the possible spread of the virus, a total of 967 students and employees from schools in Singapore have been placed on leave of absence because of their recent travel history to China. On Saturday, authorities began distributing packs of four surgical masks for each Singapore household. There have been long queues for masks at pharmacies and retailers across the country.  Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing on Thursday reassured people that Singapore will have enough masks, provided the supply is managed ""appropriately"".

09 Feb 2020 11:36AM,"FairPrice imposes purchase limits for paper products, rice and instant noodles amid coronavirus outbreak","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Shoppers at all NTUC FairPrice outlets will only be allowed to buy four packs of paper products, two bags of rice and four bundle packs of instant noodles per customer from Sunday (Feb 9). In a notice put up in stores across Singapore on Sunday morning, FairPrice said the purchase limits were put in place “to ensure more customers have access to high-demand items”. The S$50 limit for vegetables also remained in place. The move came after supermarkets saw a surge in demand for groceries and personal hygiene items, after the Government raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange due to the global coronavirus outbreak. On Sunday, the Ministry of Health confirmed three new cases of the novel coronavirus, taking the total number of cases in Singapore to 43. The virus has killed more than 800 people and infected more than 37,000 globally. The additional purchase limits are part of efforts to discourage customers from stockpiling, said a FairPrice spokesperson in response to CNA's queries. ""The limits are set just slightly higher than what an average grocery shopper normally buys to give customers greater purchase flexibility. Bulk purchase of vegetables is disallowed to discourage resellers,"" said the spokesperson, urging shoppers to buy only what they need. In the notice, FairPrice also reassured customers that a supply of daily essentials remains available despite the sudden surge in demand and noted that deliveries to stores have been increased. FairPrice Group CEO Seah Kian Peng had said on Saturday that there were more than 9 million toilet rolls, about 1.2 million packs of instant noodles and more than 4 million kg of rice in its distribution centres. Supermarket chains Sheng Siong, Prime Supermarket and Dairy Farm Group, which runs the Giant and Cold Storage supermarkets, said they have not implemented purchase limits as there is sufficient stock to meet customers' needs. “We will not limit customers’ purchase and we trust the public to be rational and not stockpile as food items will expire,” said a Sheng Siong spokesperson. ""BUY WHAT YOU NEED"" FairPrice has increased the volume of its daily essentials being sent to its stores by three times, he had said. The number of delivery trips has also doubled. “This sudden surge was one that, I would say, caught us by surprise. But I want to assure everyone out there, as you have seen at one of our three warehouses here, we do have stock available. But it does take us time to replenish the stocks, of which we are trying our best,” said Mr Seah. He urged shoppers to only ""buy what you need"", saying that there's no need for them to ""create your own little stockpile at home"". ""Because when you do that and everyone’s trying to get it on the same day and at the same time buying more things, you just add strain to the system.” On Sunday evening, Mr Seah reiterated in a Facebook post that the purchase limits were imposed ""NOT because we do not have enough stocks"". The limits were instead put in place to ""allow our supply chain to CATCH UP on its deliveries to all our stores"" and ""ensure no one can buy up huge quantities and hoard and deprive others as a result"", he said. Even as FairPrice ""doubled"" its delivery runs over the last two days, it was still not enough as the volume of products handled was ""more than the peak days of CNY"", he added.  ""My supply chain and whole team are working non-stop to try to catch up on deliveries to all our stores,"" said Mr Seah, adding that they ""are making good progress"". ""Let us stay calm and work through this period together as a community. It is beginning to look more like a normal Sunday."" Additional reporting by Deborah Wong.

07 Feb 2020 12:01PM,29th coronavirus case visited Seletar clinic before being sent to hospital,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The 41-year-old man identified on Thursday (Feb 6) as Singapore’s 29th confirmed case of novel coronavirus had visited the Seletar clinic of Phoenix Medical Group twice before his infection was confirmed. In a circular dated Feb 6, the Phoenix Medical Group said the man had visited its clinic in Seletar last Thursday and again on Monday. The man appeared “quite ill” with gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms, as well as a moderate fever when he visited the clinic on Monday, and was asked to go to the emergency department, the group said. He did not fulfil the Health Ministry’s (MOH) criteria for a suspected case of the coronavirus and as such was not sent to the hospital using a dedicated ambulance service, the circular said. MOH then brought the case to Phoenix Medical’s attention at around midday on Thursday for active contact tracing, it added, noting the group was informed that his infection was confirmed later that night. The 41-year-old, who is a Singapore citizen, had no recent travel history to mainland China and no known links with the other confirmed cases of the virus. In its statement on Thursday, MOH said the man had developed a fever on Jan 28, five days after the first confirmed case of the coronavirus here was reported. The ministry said that he had visited a general practitioner’s clinic on Jan 29, and subsequently sought treatment at another clinic on Jan 30, before being admitted to the Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital on Monday. MOH did not name the clinics. On Wednesday at about 11pm, test results confirmed the man was infected by the coronavirus. “Epidemiological investigations and contact tracing are ongoing to identify individuals who had close contact with the case, and to establish any link he may have had with confirmed cases in Singapore or travellers from mainland China,” MOH said in its statement. “We are interviewing the patient and his close contacts, and investigating the locations he had recently been to,” it added. Dr Chua Hshan Cher, a general practitioner at the clinic, said they initially considered the possibility of a coronavirus infection to be low as he did not meet the criteria stipulated by MOH. The patient was tested for dengue fever and influenza last Thursday, both of which came back negative, he added. They also considered the possibility that he might have sepsis. When he came back on Monday, his symptoms had worsened and he developed gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite and loose stools. ""We referred him to hospital because there was progression of symptoms, no response to treatment and the patient appeared to be unwell,"" Dr Chua said. In the Phoenix Medical Group’s circular – signed by three of the clinic’s doctors – it said all the rooms, corridors, table tops, seats and examination couches had been ""deep cleansed"" between 6pm and 9pm on Thursday. The clinic had also engaged the mall operator's help in changing all the filters in the air conditioners, said Dr Chua. ""We've also implemented a strict recommendation of daily temperature taking, hourly sanitation and ensuring that any staff who feels unwell is sent home immediately."" He added that masks are compulsory for staff.   Previous measures include a questionnaire asking patients if they have travelled to China in the past two weeks or had contact with anyone who had been to China within the same time period. They also ask for patients for their occupation, so as to identify frontline jobs that may expose the patients to potential Chinese visitors. The doctor who attended to the man is on a voluntary leave of absence until Feb 17, and is currently well, it noted. “We would like to assure members of the public, patients and well-meaning family and friends that we will remain vigilant against the scourge of the novel coronavirus and continue our fight against it,” Phoenix Medical said in the circular.

03 Feb 2020 01:04AM,US universities set up front-line defences to keep coronavirus at bay,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners ILLINOIS: On its sprawling campus in America's heartland, thousands of miles from China, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has taken aggressive steps to keep the fast-spreading coronavirus away from its classrooms and students. The school, with one of the highest percentages of Chinese students among US universities, has suspended academic programmes in China for the spring semester and banned students from travelling to the country for academic-related matters. It has advised faculty and staff to follow federal travel advisories that, as of Friday, warned against going to China. ""We want to take all of the precautions we can so, in the worst-case scenario, we keep our community healthy,"" said Robin Kaler, associate chancellor for public affairs at the University of Illinois, 217 kilometres south of Chicago, where the first human-to-human transmission of the disease in the United States was confirmed last week. More than 350,000 Chinese students are pursuing higher education in the United States and 10,000 American students are enrolled in academic programmes in China. The sheer number of the students, many of whom have travelled to their home country in recent weeks, makes schools a potential incubator for a widespread outbreak in the United States, given the close proximity of dormitory life. ""Colleges and universities are very much on the front line of those because of our role as global institutions,"" Sarah Van Orman, chief health officer at the University of Southern California (USC) said. ""The challenge is making sure that we are being prudent without overstating the risk."" In dealing with the new outbreak, officials at US colleges and universities can draw from their experiences with previous public health scares, including the 2003 outbreak of the SARS coronavirus. A 'DELICATE BALANCE' At University of Illinois, with some 5,800 Chinese students, Kaler sees a challenge in keeping the campus free of the new coronavirus without infringing on rights or fanning xenophobia. There is a need to strike a ""delicate balance"" between public safety and personal freedom when dealing with a growing public health issue, Kaler said. Even so, officials would prefer to err on the side of caution. ""If they want to come and fuss at us later, we would rather have them be alive to be able to come fuss at us than not,"" she said. USC, where 6,600 students from China attend college, has taken similar steps in banning students from travelling to China and strongly advising against faculty making the trip. Officials at the school have encouraged concerned students from Wuhan, the outbreak's epicentre in central China, to talk with school counsellors about their concerns for loved ones back home, while trying not to stigmatize Chinese students on campus. While the new coronavirus has spread to more than 20 countries, all of the nearly 260 deaths as of Saturday have occurred in China, with the vast majority of the thousands of cases recorded in and around Wuhan, capital of Hubei province. ""There's an unfortunate history about many communicable diseases that have started in one population,"" said Van Orman, whose school has a total student population of 48,800. ""It leads to harm for those individuals and does nothing to stop the spread of the illness."" New York University (NYU), where more than 7,000 Chinese students go to college, has pushed back the start of its spring semester at NYU Shanghai by two weeks to Feb 17. The 60,000-student school has also made available online course work and alternative programmes abroad to students affected by the postponement and travel restrictions. The university's health centre staff ""are being particularly vigilant about getting travel and contact histories as they evaluate students who present with respiratory ailments and complaints,"" said NYU spokesman John Beckman. University of Illinois officials contacted each of its 150 students from Wuhan and asked them to take the necessary precautions and, if they were feeling ill, to immediately seek medical attention. Many students who went home to Wuhan recently responded to the school and said they were self-quarantining. The dean of students is helping those students work with their professors in order for them to continue their studies while at home. ""The students obviously are very concerned themselves,"" Kaler said. ""We have found our students very responsible and receptive when we have asked them to take precautions."" The sight of many Asian students wearing masks as a preventative measure when they are on campus may lead to stereotyping and discrimination, according to Kaler. ""We try to be sensitive to that sort of thing because we don't ever want any of our students to feel singled out or unwelcome simply because of where they come from,"" she said.

05 Feb 2020 03:06PM,More Chinese cities shut down as novel coronavirus death toll rises,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners HANGZHOU: Millions more people have been ordered to stay indoors as China battles to curb the spread of a new virus that authorities said on Wednesday (Feb 5) has already killed nearly 500 people. With more than 24,000 cases in China, a growing number of cities have been imposing a range of restrictions in recent days far from central Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, as authorities struggle to contain the virus. Global concerns have risen as more countries found cases that were not imported from China and 10 people tested positive for the virus on a ship quarantined off the coast of Japan. Some 56 million people in Hubei have been under virtual lockdown since last week, with its capital Wuhan at the heart of the health emergency. In Hangzhou, about 175km southwest of Shanghai, green fences blocked streets near the headquarters of Chinese tech giant Alibaba as a fighter jet circled overhead. Alibaba, one of the world's most valuable companies, appeared shut down, while deliverymen moved in and out of the nearby fenced-in residential areas to drop off groceries. Many people were also seen going out. The firm is inside one of three districts where about 3 million people were told this week that only one person per household would be allowed outside every two days to buy necessities.   ""Please don't go out, don't go out, don't go out!"" blared a message on a loudspeaker urging people to wear masks, wash their hands regularly and report any people who are from Hubei - a common fear in other parts of the country that people from the province might infect others. At least three other cities in eastern Zhejiang province - Taizhou, Wenzhou and parts of Ningbo - have imposed the same measures, affecting about 18 million people. Similar policies were encouraged by authorities in two cities as far as China's northeasternmost province, Heilongjiang, and a handful of others along the east coast. In Henan province, which borders Hubei, a district in the city of Zhumadian decided that only one person could leave each household every five days. Residents there have been offered cash rewards for informing on people from Hubei. GLOBAL JITTERS The disease is believed to have emerged in December in a Wuhan market that sold wild animals, and spread rapidly as people travelled for the Lunar New Year holiday in January. The death toll has steadily increased, rising to 490 in China after Hubei reported 65 more people had died.   Most deaths have been in the province and officials have noted that the death rate, at around 2 per cent, is below the mortality rate of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. The new coronavirus is from the same family of pathogens as the one that causes SARS, which killed some 800 people in 2002-2003.  The epidemic has prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a global health emergency, several governments to institute travel restrictions, and airlines to suspend flights to and from China. United and American Airlines said Wednesday they have added Hong Kong to their China flight suspensions. On Wednesday Japan said at least 10 passengers on a cruise ship carrying 3,711 people have the virus. Japanese authorities began testing those on board after a former passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the illness. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Tuesday advised Britons to leave China ""if they can"", to minimise their risk of exposure to the virus. 'WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY' But the WHO said Tuesday that dramatic measures taken by China offered a chance to halt transmission. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the great majority of cases are in China. ""That doesn't mean that it won't get worse. But for sure we have a window of opportunity to act,"" he said. Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand all reported new infections not imported from China on Tuesday. Two fatalities have been reported outside the mainland, in Hong Kong and the Philippines. Semi-autonomous Hong Kong has closed all but two land crossings with the Chinese mainland. As countries battle to keep the virus off their shores, the WHO chief accused wealthy countries of falling short on their duties in sharing data. ""Of the 176 cases reported outside China so far, WHO has received complete case report forms for only 38 percent,"" he said.

07 Feb 2020 04:01PM,Taiwan says coronavirus couple likely infected on Hong Kong flight to Italy,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TAIPEI: A Taiwanese couple who recently tested positive for the novel coronavirus likely picked up their infections on a flight from Hong Kong to Italy, authorities said. The couple, both retirees in their fifties, had no history of travel to the Chinese mainland but were admitted to hospital on Feb 4, three days after returning from a holiday in Italy. They transited in Hong Kong on their journey to and from Europe. ""After consultations with experts, we came to the conclusion that the most likely place of infection was on board the aircraft from Hong Kong to Europe where it was a confined space,"" Health and Welfare Minister Chen Shih-chung told reporters late Thursday (Feb 6). The case highlights how air travel can spread the virus which has killed more than 600 people in China, where the outbreak first began. Hong Kong has 24 confirmed infections, including one death, and transmissions among locals who have not travelled to China recently are increasing. Taiwan confirmed five new cases on Thursday - including the couple - bringing their total number to sixteen. Also among the new infections was a woman in her forties who spent the Chinese New Year in Macau with three other family members. Taiwan has stopped all Chinese nationals from entering its borders and has temporarily suspended all online visa applications for Hong Kong and Macau residents. Other foreign nationals who have visited China, Hong Kong and Macau in the past 14 days are also barred from entry. ""I want to advise everyone to wear a face mask at all times when travelling in an aircraft and also in confined spaces such as inside airports,"" Chen said.

05 Feb 2020 12:45AM,Four-year-old coronavirus patient in Malaysia discharged from hospital,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners KUALA LUMPUR: A girl in Malaysia has recovered from the novel coronavirus infection and will be allowed to return home to China, a Malaysian health official said in a statement late on Tuesday (Feb 4). The four-year-old is the first in the country to have recovered after becoming infected with the coronavirus. There are currently 10 confirmed cases in Malaysia. Malaysia Health Ministry's director general Noor Hisham Abdullah said detection tests were repeated twice and the results came back negative. ""She is now is good health and has been allowed to return home,"" he said. The girl and her family will return to China with a health certificate issued by the hospital, chief of press at the Chinese embassy Tang Tang told reporters by text message. The child was diagnosed last week and treated in an isolation ward at a hospital in Langkawi, a popular island holiday destination.  Malaysia on Tuesday confirmed the country's first citizen case of the novel coronavirus. Malaysian Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad said the man from Selangor is in stable condition and receiving treatment at Sungai Buloh Hospital. Singapore’s Ministry of Health (MOH) on Tuesday said the Malaysian national was in Singapore from Jan 16 to Jan 23 for a business meeting at the Grand Hyatt Hotel that involved Chinese nationals. After his return to Malaysia, the 42-year-old man developed symptoms and was subsequently tested positive for the novel coronavirus on Feb 3. Singapore's health ministry said it has initiated epidemiological investigations and contact tracing to identify the individuals who had close contact with the cases. The man started showing symptoms on Jan 29, nearly a week after he returned to Malaysia, according to Malaysian authorities. The man's immediate family will also be put under ""home surveillance"" for 14 days, Dr Dzulkefly added.

12 Feb 2020 01:34PM,Overworked and unprotected: Wuhan doctors in China's coronavirus epicentre risk infection,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: Doctors on the frontline of China's new coronavirus epidemic are facing a daunting task: Treat an ever-growing number of infected patients and risk getting infected themselves due to a drastic shortage of masks and other protective equipment. Tired and understaffed, medical workers have had to deal with thousands of new cases per week in Wuhan, the city at the epicentre of the outbreak that first emerged late last year. Many doctors have had to see patients without proper masks or protective body suits, resorting to reusing the same equipment when they should be changed regularly. Some have even worn diapers to avoid having to take off the equipment and make it last longer, according to a health official. One doctor at a community clinic in Wuhan said he and at least 16 other colleagues were showing symptoms similar to the new virus, including lung infections and coughing. ""As doctors, we do not want to work while being a source of infection,"" he told AFP, requesting anonymity for fear of reprisals. But ""right now, there is no one to replace you,"" the doctor explained, adding that all medical staff without a fever are expected to work. ""What would happen if there was no one working on the frontline?""  Some 44 per cent of the 42,600 cases nationwide - and the majority of more than 1,100 deaths - have been in Wuhan, home to a wild animal market where the virus is suspected of having originated before spreading between humans. The risks medical staff are facing was highlighted on Friday after Li Wenliang, a whistleblowing doctor in Wuhan, succumbed to the disease more than a month after he first raised alarm about a new SARS-like virus in the city.   His death unleashed an outpouring of grief and anger on Chinese social media, with 10 academics in Wuhan circulating an open letter calling for political reform and freedom of speech.   MASK DEFICIT The deputy mayor of Wuhan said on Friday the city faced a daily shortage of 56,000 N95 masks and 41,000 protective suits. Medical staff in protective suits will ""wear diapers, reduce how much water they drink, and reduce how many times they use the bathroom"", said Jiao Yahui, a top official at China's National Health Commission. Some of them will wear the same protective suit for six or even nine hours, when they should not be worn for more than four hours in a quarantined ward, she said last week. ""Of course, we don't advocate this method, but medical staff really have no alternative,"" she admitted.   The Chinese government has responded by mobilising the entire country to increase production of masks and suits. As of Monday, three-quarters of mask and suit producers had resumed work following an extended Chinese New Year holiday, said Cong Liang, an official at China's top economic planner. China has also imported more than 300 million masks and about 3.9 million articles of protective clothing since January 24, an official said last week. The Red Cross Society of China too has received over 900 million yuan (US$129 million) in donations for epidemic relief - though it has drawn scrutiny for its lack of transparency and efficiency. ""Even if we receive more masks, the number of patients increases even faster,"" said a doctor at a major Wuhan hospital, who requested anonymity because she was not authorised to speak with media.   Each doctor or nurse uses two to four masks each day, she explained. ""The consumption of masks in the hospital is enormous,"" she emphasised. ""They have a permanent lack of masks."" Doctors have also been forced to don makeshift hazmat suits, which are not adequate protection against the virus, said Xu Yuan, a 34-year-old in the US who donated US$5,000 in protective equipment to former classmates working at Wuhan hospitals. ""As soon as he put it on, (the suit) cracked because it was too small for him,"" she said, describing a friend in Wuhan - who was also forced to wear the same hazmat suit for five days. ""Everyday, he disinfects it after use,"" she told AFP. ""He said it may have been useless, but it is still better than nothing."" CALLS FOR HELP Handling the daily deluge of new cases takes another kind of toll too, said the doctor at the large hospital in Wuhan, whose colleagues are handling confirmed cases of virus patients. ""They are exhausted,"" she told AFP. One of her colleagues, for instance, works at a clinic that receives 400 patients within eight hours. Many are dealing with patients ""who die very quickly, whom they have not managed to save,"" she said. ""They have a lot of pressure,"" the doctor said, adding that her hospital had set up psychological monitoring. Many Wuhan residents are worried, too, said the doctor at the community clinic. He and his colleagues receive calls from distressed community members, he said - some of whom are too afraid to leave their homes. ""You can hear their calls for help, but your hands are tied,"" the doctor said, describing families where patients are stuck at home without medical treatment. ""There's nothing we can do.""

10 Feb 2020 07:40PM,"Singapore Airlines, SilkAir suspend some flights to China over coronavirus outbreak","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore Airlines (SIA) and its regional wing SilkAir will suspend some flights to China after fears over the novel coronavirus outbreak affected demand ""significantly"", Singapore's national carrier said on Monday (Feb 10). ""Minimum connectivity"" to several key cities will be maintained, SIA said. The move comes after demand for air travel between Singapore and China declined significantly as a result of the outbreak, said SIA on its website. As a result, services to some Chinese destinations will be ""temporarily suspended until the situation improves"", it added. Several SIA flights between Singapore and Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou will be suspended between Feb 4 and Mar 29. Some SilkAir flights between Singapore and Shenzhen, Xiamen, Chengdu and Chongqing will be halted during that period.  SIA said that the group will maintain some connectivity to key cities. In response to queries, SIA told CNA that following the reduced frequencies, it will operate seven flights each to Beijing and Shanghai weekly, thrice a week to Guangzhou and once a week to Chongqing. ""There are still many Singaporeans working and living in China now, many of whom will still require connectivity between Singapore and China,"" said SIA. ""As the national carrier, we will continue to maintain minimum connectivity to the key cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chongqing for now despite the reduced demand,"" added SIA.   SIA had said on Jan 31 said it would reduce capacity on some of its routes to China in February due to the growing scale of the coronavirus epidemic. SIA's low-cost carrier Scoot also suspended flights to 11 Chinese cities from early February until the end of March and reduced frequencies to eight other Chinese destinations.  Singapore on Friday raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange, after several cases of coronavirus without travel history to mainland China or links to previous cases. The virus has infected 43 people in Singapore as of Sunday, six of whom have been discharged.

03 Feb 2020 02:01AM,China has not yet accepted US help with coronavirus: White House adviser,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners WASHINGTON: China has been more transparent about the coronavirus than it has been in previous crises but Beijing has not yet accepted a US offer of help to contain the epidemic, White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien said on Sunday (Feb 2). ""So far the Chinese have been more transparent certainly than in past crises and we appreciate that,"" O'Brien said in an interview with CBS' ""Face the Nation."" However, Beijing has still not responded to US offers of help from the federal Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and other health professionals to help contain the fast-moving, flu-like virus that has killed more than 300 people in China. ""We have not heard back yet from the Chinese on those offers but we are prepared to continue to cooperate with them,"" O'Brien said. ""We've got tremendous expertise. This is a worldwide concern. We want to help our Chinese colleagues if we can and we've made the offer and we'll see if they accept the offer."" While they have not been invited into China, CDC officials are in neighbouring Kazakhstan to help guard against spread of the virus, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday during a visit there. ""You’ve got a long border with China which is where this disease has emanated from,"" Pompeo said in an interview with a Kazakh journalist. ""And we’ve got our people from the Center for Disease Control right here on the ground, helping Kazakhstan deal with this so that you don’t have an enormous outbreak."" China's National Health Commission said on Sunday the coronavirus has killed 304 people in China and infections jumped to 14,380 as of Saturday. At least 171 cases have been reported in more than two dozen other countries and regions, including the United States, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong and Britain. So far, eight cases of the fast-spreading virus have been confirmed in the United States, health officials said. The Pentagon is providing housing for people arriving from overseas who might need to be quarantined. Concerns about the virus spurred the United States to declare a public health emergency and bar entry to foreign nationals who have recently visited China. The latest US patient, in Massachusetts, recently returned from Hubei province in central China, the CDC said. The coronavirus is believed to have originated in a market that traded illegally in wildlife in Hubei's provincial capital, Wuhan.

04 Feb 2020 10:43AM,Hong Kong reports first coronavirus death,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners HONG KONG: A man has died in Hong Kong from the novel coronavirus, the city's first fatality from the deadly virus and the second outside mainland China. Medical authorities confirmed a 39-year-old man who was being treated for the virus died on Tuesday morning (Feb 4).  The man was a resident of Hong Kong who had travelled last month to Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak, returning home on Jan 23 via a high-speed rail link. Officials said the man also had diabetes, but had been stable until his condition suddenly deteriorated. They said the precise cause of death was unclear and the case will be handed over to the coroner. So far the only other reported fatality outside of the Chinese mainland has been in the Philippines. Hong Kong now has 17 confirmed cases, most of whom were infected in mainland China. But four cases are suspected to be local transmissions, including two people confirmed on Tuesday afternoon who have no history of recent travel to the mainland.   ""NEXT 14 DAYS ARE CRITICAL"" Chuang Shuk-kwan, from Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection, said the local transmissions were a cause for concern as it could suggest the city's outbreak was becoming self-sustaining. ""We can't rule out the possibility that there will be massive transmission in the near future. So the next 14 days are very critical,"" he told reporters. The death came a day after Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced the closure of all but two land border crossings to the Chinese mainland in a bid to halt the spread of the virus. Lam has rejected calls to shut the entire border, saying such a move would be ""inappropriate and impractical"" as well as ""discriminatory"". There has been growing public anger over the government's response to the outbreak, with calls to seal the border entirely - including barring mainlanders from flying into the international airport. There is also an acute shortage of masks, while a strike by some medical workers entered its second day on Tuesday with hospital authorities saying 4,400 staff members were absent - including around 360 doctors and 2,500 nurses. The authorities said the strike was having a ""serious impact"".   While Hong Kong maintains close economic and cultural links to the Chinese mainland, a seething distrust of the authorities in Beijing permeates the city. The 2003 outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, which Beijing initially covered up, killed almost 300 people in Hong Kong and left lasting psychological scars on the densely populated city. Distrust - and at times open hostility - towards mainlanders has been worsened by years of political unrest as Hong Kongers chafe under Beijing's rule, and protest for greater democratic freedoms. The World Health Organization has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency, although experts say much is still unknown about the pathogen, including its mortality rate and transmission pathways.  The number of confirmed deaths from China's coronavirus outbreak soared past 400 on Tuesday, after authorities in Hubei province reported 64 new fatalities. There was also a sharp increase in confirmed infections with 3,235 new cases, putting the national total at more than 20,400. The death toll in mainland China now surpasses the number of fatalities from its SARS crisis two decades ago. More than 20 other countries have reported cases of infections.

06 Feb 2020 05:05AM,Drugmakers see long road ahead in coronavirus vaccine race,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners NEW YORK: Drug manufacturers racing to find a vaccine or effective treatment for the deadly new coronavirus in China cautioned that they have a long way to go. That runs counter to reports of a supposed ""breakthrough"" that on Wednesday (Feb 5) boosted financial markets and spurred optimism not necessarily backed by reality. At least a dozen drugmakers are working on vaccines or antivirals and other treatments to help those infected with the fast-spreading contagion. Investment costs for vaccines could run as high as US$800 million in a process that, even if accelerated, will likely take more than a year until approval, according to executives from companies involved in the effort.   ""It will take at least 12 to 18 months, which means in the acute situation we are in now - at least in China - that will not create a benefit,"" said Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer of GlaxoSmithKline's vaccine unit. GSK is working with developers by providing a technology that could make their vaccines more potent. The virus, which emerged in December in China, has killed nearly 500 people and shows no sign of abating, with thousands of new cases reported each day, mostly in central China's Hubei province. But its spread to some 27 countries and regions has caused global alarm. To be sure, companies developing treatments for patients who are already sick may be able to get a drug approved faster than a vaccine that would be given to healthy people. Even so, logistical and regulatory challenges remain, according to two executives at Gilead Sciences Inc, which is working on an experimental antiviral treatment. ""There is a distinction there between a therapeutic and a vaccine. Having said that, I think it is true that this won't be super fast and it will involve us investing at risk right now,"" said Gilead Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey. Clinical trials for treatments can be smaller and of shorter duration than for vaccines, Parsey acknowledged. Challenges in making sure therapies are effective and then scaling up production still remain. Gilead has only a limited supply of its remdesivir, which will be tested against the coronavirus after previously failing in trials as a treatment for Ebola. 'LOOKING FOR A MAGIC BULLET' Dr Thomas Frieden, who was director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention during the also deadly MERS outbreak, said the benefit of antiviral treatments for such emergencies in the past has been modest. What worked with MERS and SARS, for example, was better infection control in healthcare facilities, he said of two other types of coronaviruses that also caused global alarm. ""It doesn't mean we shouldn't try, but we're often looking for a magic bullet and the bright shiny object. Sometimes we need to just have the basics,"" Frieden said. A Chinese TV report on Wednesday said that a research team at Zhejiang University had found an effective drug for the virus, while researchers in the UK told Sky News separately they had made a ""significant breakthrough"" in finding a vaccine. Reuters could not independently verify the reports, but several traders cited them for sharp upticks in global stock markets. ""There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV,"" said World Health Organisation spokesman Tarik Jasarevic, using the current designation for the new coronavirus, when asked about reports of ""drug breakthroughs."" Health officials in the United States and China have set ambitious goals for getting a vaccine to initial human testing within the next few months. Newer vaccine platforms, such as one developed by Moderna Inc, allow scientists to create a potential vaccine in record time just based on knowing the genetic code of the novel coronavirus. With the genetic code in hand, scientists can start vaccine development without needing a sample of the virus. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is using Moderna's platform, said the agency is on the fastest pace ever to develop a vaccine candidate. He hopes to have a vaccine available for initial safety testing within two and a half to three months from the time scientists determined the genetic sequence of the virus. Novavax Inc research chief Gregory Glenn told Reuters his company has taken vaccines from discovery to clinical testing in 90 days and believes it could do something similar for the new coronavirus. But to move vaccine candidates from the lab to widespread use in patients involves a number of hurdles, according to health experts and executives for drugmakers working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments. In addition to scaling up manufacturing capacity and building distribution networks, there are regulatory hurdles such as conducting large clinical trials to make sure a vaccine not only confers immunity to the virus but is safe for use in the general population. ""The earliest you could even know if it's going to work is a year,"" Fauci said. Whether even a highly effective vaccine will prove profitable for companies is another big question. ""The outbreak could be abating by the time a vaccine is deemed safe,"" Karen Andersen, who follows biotech companies for Morningstar, said in a research note. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has raised around US$800 million from donors to aid in preventing pandemic diseases and has allocated some of those funds to biotechs, including Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc, Moderna Inc and CureVac, which are working on coronavirus vaccines. ""We stepped into this with no economic expectation,"" said Paul Stoffels, Johnson & Johnson's chief scientific officer. ""We'll see whether in the end it gives a reward.""

The central Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, reported 94 new deaths. This includes 72 deaths in the provincial capital of Wuhan, where the virus first emerged. Across mainland China, there were 2,015 new confirmed infections on Tuesday, the lowest since Jan 30. The total accumulated number so far has reached 44,653. The new virus is believed to have emerged last year in a market that sells wild animals in Wuhan. China's senior medical adviser said on Tuesday that the coronavirus outbreak in the country may be over by April, and the latest numbers of new cases may further feed that optimism.  The virus was officially named ""COVID-19"" at a conference in Geneva held by the World Health Organization, where the body's chief said countries had a chance of stopping its global spread. WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Tuesday that although 99 per cent of cases are in China, where it remains ""very much an emergency"", it also ""holds a very grave threat for the rest of the world"". He urged countries to share data in order to further research the disease.

06 Feb 2020 03:57PM,WHO investigates Singapore conference linked to foreign coronavirus spread,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: At least three employees of a multinational company that held a meeting of more than 100 international staff in Singapore have contracted the new coronavirus, sparking a World Health Organization investigation of the case. Malaysia and South Korea have confirmed three cases of the virus related to the mid-January company meeting held with 94 overseas staff at the Grand Hyatt hotel, and Singapore said late on Wednesday (Feb 5) four other attendees were showing symptoms. The sister of a Malaysian who attended has since been infected, while Singapore said virus symptoms had surfaced in four of the firm's local staff. Authorities have not revealed the name of the company, although Korea has said it was an international sales firm. Malaysian health authorities have said people from China including one from the city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged in December, attended. ""WHO is coordinating with relevant ministries of health in relation to it,"" Olivia Lawe-Davies, a spokeswoman for the WHO, said in response to questions from Reuters. ""As countries are stepping up surveillance, the detection of more cases of local transmission can be expected."" Singapore has reported 28 cases of the coronavirus, including some involving person-to-person transmission. The cases linked to the Singapore business meeting provide more evidence the virus is spreading through human-to-human contact outside China, which the WHO has said is deeply concerning and could signal a much larger outbreak. China reported its biggest daily jump in fatalities from the virus on Thursday, up 73 to 563, although there have been only two reported deaths outside mainland China. Malaysian health authorities first revealed the link to the Singapore business meeting when they confirmed the case of a 41-year-old Malaysian who had attended it, along with colleagues from China. South Korea subsequently confirmed two cases involving South Koreans who attended the conference. The Koreans and the Malaysian shared a buffet meal during the conference, South Korean media reported. Of the 15 Singapore attendees, four have been referred to its National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore's health ministry said. All the overseas attendees have left Singapore, the ministry added. A spokesman for the Grand Hyatt, Gerald Kheng, said the hotel had been deep cleaned after it was first informed of the incident by the health ministry on Tuesday and it was not aware of any other cases among guests or staff. In a statement on Thursday, the hotel's general manager Mr Willi Martin said the hotel has engaged a government-appointed external agency to carry out a ""thorough sanitisation"" and deep cleaning of ""potentially impacted guestrooms"". ""The Singapore Ministry of Health is still investigating the cases with the relevant authorities and has not advised details on how, where or when these individuals were infected with the virus,"" he said. Singapore says no evidence has emerged of widespread community spread but it announced new precautionary measures on Tuesday including halting group activities such as school assemblies. Several firms in Singapore have suspended business and media events, including a big travel fair, but the Singapore Airshow is set to go ahead next week albeit on a smaller scale.

04 Feb 2020 11:04PM,HIV drugs used to treat 'small number' of coronavirus patients: MOH chief health scientist,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: A ""small number"" of coronavirus patients in Singapore are being treated with HIV drugs, the Ministry of Health's (MOH) chief health scientist Tan Chorh Chuan said on Tuesday (Feb 4). ""In a small number of cases some of the HIV drugs Lopinavir and Ritonavir have been used here,"" said Prof Tan at a press conference. ""The trials are being done in China and other places, but they're being used here. We need to see the results of the trials to see how effective they are, but the results so far from other studies have looked quite promising."" He said the results of the clinical trials ""should be out, we hope, in the weeks ahead"". Doctors in Thailand, where there are more than two dozen cases, said on Sunday they have seen success in treating severe cases of the coronavirus with a combination of medications for flu and HIV. The Thai doctors said the treatment had improved the condition of several patients under their care, including a 70-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan. The treatment includes a mixture of the HIV drugs Lopinavir and Ritonavir, in combination with flu drug Oseltamivir in large doses, they added. Speaking to reporters after the press conference, Prof Tan said clinical trials would be “much easier” in a place with more patients, like Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. “We’re waiting to see how it proceeds and we hope in the weeks ahead we'll have some indication,"" Prof Tan said. “In the meantime, I mean, amongst the different drugs that have been tested in the past, these agents appear to be effective, but we can’t be certain at the moment. They appear promising. I think the trials will help us understand, whether or not, how effective it will be,” he added. Prof Tan noted that when the first case of the coronavirus was detected in Singapore, a diagnostic kit was ready due to the efforts of scientists and researchers in the background. “That’s because we’re able, really, to take the sequences that have been published, and to create rapid diagnostic kits, and to rapidly scale up the numbers so that we are able to diagnose the cases early,” he said. This is “quite different” from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, when there were no diagnostic kits for the first five weeks, which made containment efforts ""much more difficult"", Prof Tan added.   Singapore confirmed on Tuesday its first locally transmitted cases of the novel coronavirus, among six new cases of the virus. One patient was a tourist guide for a group of Chinese tourists, two work at a shop the group had visited, while a fourth case of local transmission was the domestic helper of one of the cases, said MOH at a briefing.

Additionally, a Chinese female tourist from Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, was also tested positive on Wednesday, bringing the total number of cases in Malaysia to 14, Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad said. Elaborating on the case of the Malaysian woman, Dr Dzukefly said the 40-year-old had direct contact with her brother while they were celebrating Chinese New Year at their hometown on Jan 23. “She started having fever and sore throat on Feb 1, and started coughing on Feb 4. She received treatment at a private clinic. “After her brother was confirmed to have the coronavirus, she was tracked down by the Kuala Muda health authorities (in Kedah state). Samples were taken from her and her family members, and she was tested positive on Feb 5,” he said. She is now being treated at Hospital Sultanah Bahiyah, Alor Setar, and is in stable condition. Her other family members – husband and two teenage children – tested negative, the minister said. ""Her brother is considered the first Malaysian imported case, while she is the first Malaysian transmitted, local case,"" Dr Dzulkefly said. As for the case of the Chinese tourist, Dr Dzukefly said she arrived in Malaysia on Jan 25 together with her mother and three friends. The woman, 37, received treatment for mild fever on Feb 1 at Kuala Lumpur Hospital and was placed under home surveillance. When she was found to be still showing the symptoms, she was referred to the hospital again to be warded for treatment and further investigation on Wednesday. She tested positive on the same day and is now being treated in an isolated ward. Separately, a Canadian national who was sent by a hazmat team from the Kuala Lumpur City Centre to the hospital, tested negative for the coronavirus, Dr Dzulkefly said.

11 Feb 2020 05:55AM,Cleared for discharge: What we know about the coronavirus patients who recovered in Malaysia,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners KUALA LUMPUR: Three patients in Malaysia who tested positive for the novel coronavirus have been discharged from hospital after making a full recovery. They have now been cleared for return to their home country. The trio of Chinese nationals have been referred to the Chinese Embassy in Malaysia for further consular assistance, a spokesperson from Malaysia's Ministry of Health said in response to CNA's queries on Monday (Feb 10). Once they land in China, they will be subject to medical screening conducted by the Chinese authorities, which will then share their latest condition with Malaysia. The spokesperson confirmed that contact tracing for all three discharged patients have been completed. Three people linked to Case 6, 17 people linked to the Case 4 and 17 linked to Case 10 were tracked. All were asymptomatic, the spokesperson added. Here is what we know about the three discharged cases: CASE 6 Who: A four-year-old girl from Guangdong, China. She was discharged from Langkawi’s Sultanah Maliha Hospital on Feb 4.   Details: Together with her parents and younger sister, the girl arrived at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Jan 20 and travelled to Langkawi on Jan 24. Both children developed fever, cough and flu, and sought medical treatment at the hospital on Jan 26. She tested positive for the novel coronavirus on Jan 28 and was treated in an isolation ward, while the test result was negative for her sister. Subsequently, during the treatment phase, two clinical samples were taken and she tested negative for the virus. She was the first novel coronavirus patient in Malaysia to make a full recovery. The ministry said her case proved that those infected may be treated and it was possible for patients to recover completely, as reported among many other cases in China. “Many believe that this virus would be fatal to those infected but this is not accurate,” the ministry said in a statement. Malaysian media reported that the girl and her family flew back to Guangzhou from Kuala Lumpur on Sunday morning.   CASE 4 Who: A 40-year-old man from Wuhan, China. He was discharged from Johor’s Permai Hospital on Feb 8. Details: He arrived in Johor Bahru on Jan 22 after travelling by bus from Singapore. The bus carried 17 tourists including the man’s wife and child, authorities said. He developed a fever on Jan 23 and was warded the next day for high fever and pneumonia. His condition worsened the next day, and he required additional oxygen support. The Crisis Preparedness and Response Centre received a report on Jan 25 that he tested positive for the coronavirus. The hospital began treating him with antiviral medicine Kaletra, an HIV drug, on Jan 28. After eight days of treatment, the patient’s condition improved and he fully recovered. He tested negative three times for the novel coronavirus and was discharged on Saturday evening.   CASE 10 Who: A 63-year-old man from Wuhan, China. He was discharged from Kuala Lumpur Hospital on Feb 9. Details: The man arrived in Malaysia via Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Jan 18. He was down with light fever on Jan 23 and received outpatient treatment in a private hospital in Kuala Lumpur. His case was referred to the Health Ministry and he was placed under home surveillance for 14 days. He was sent to Kuala Lumpur Hospital as his fever persisted. He tested positive on Feb 3. He was stable and received symptomatic treatment and continuous monitoring. He did not require antiviral medication. Health Director-General Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah confirmed he tested negative for the virus on two tests conducted on Feb 7 and Feb 8. POSSIBLE FOR CASES TO RELAPSE: HEALTH MINISTER As of Monday, Malaysia has a total of 18 confirmed cases, of whom 12 are Chinese nationals. When asked if a relapse was possible for patients who recovered from the coronavirus, Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad said in a press conference on Monday that it could happen. “We are monitoring very closely ... The is a possibility of relapse, but so far we have not seen this in any of our patients. “Once you have contracted this, you would built up the immunity. For you to go from positive to negative means you have enough immunity to ward off the virus. “However, if a relapse happens, within a short time frame, then it’s something new which we need to learn from. To date though, there have been no findings in that direction,"" he said.

11 Feb 2020 07:24PM,Malaysian Health Minister announces joint working committee with Singapore to tackle novel coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners KUALA LUMPUR: The health ministries of Malaysia and Singapore will form a joint working committee headed by the respective deputy ministers to manage the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. Malaysian Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad said in a press conference on Tuesday (Feb 11) that the decision to set up the committee was made during a conference call involving senior officials from both countries. The committee aims to consolidate various cross-border efforts, he said. The two-way cooperation will focus on sharing information on public health, medicine and research to ensure that the outbreak is handled efficiently. Singapore's Ministry of Health (MOH) in a press release on Tuesday said that senior health officials from both countries will work closely together over the next few days to determine the composition and terms of reference of this joint-workgroup. ""Singapore has nominated Senior Minister of State for Transport and Health Dr Lam Pin Min to co-chair the joint working group,"" MOH added. CROSS-BORDER SCREENING Malaysia and Singapore will also scrutinise cross-border case screening and management, Dr Dzulkefly said. In addition, both sides will coordinate on the use of antiviral drugs for patients who have been tested positive, he said. He explained that the first meeting would be held once both deputy ministers find a mutually acceptable time. When asked why Malaysia had decided to embark on such a bilateral initiative at this juncture, he said the committee was important as both countries are close to one another.   ""We have got a historical relationship, we have got a good bilateral relationship ... We share the same causeway, there are hundreds of people travelling across each day for reasons of family, business and leisure, so all the more why we should strengthen and enhance our cooperation managing this coronavirus outbreak,"" he said. MOH said on Tuesday that since the start of the outbreak, both countries have been in close touch with one another, including ""expeditiously sharing information on cross-border cases"". ""The cooperation would not have been possible without the strong collaboration and network built up over the years,"" MOH added. On Tuesday, the minister said there were no new confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Malaysia, which means the total number of cases remained at 18. Of the total, 12 are Chinese nationals and six are Malaysian citizens. At least seven cases in Malaysia are said to have travelled to Singapore. Three patients, all of whom are Chinese nationals, have been discharged. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Copyright© Mediacorp 2020. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

07 Feb 2020 03:31PM,In sickness and in health: Mass wedding defies coronavirus fears,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners GAPYEONG: Thousands of couples - some in facemasks - tied the knot in a mass Unification Church wedding Friday (Feb 7), despite concerns in South Korea over the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. The church founded by Sun Myung Moon - revered as a messiah by his followers - distributed face coverings to the 30,000 crowd, but only some donned them. ""I am overwhelmed that I am getting married today,"" said Choi Ji-young, who met her husband - matched by the church - only two months ago.   ""It would be a lie if I said I was not concerned at all about the infection,"" said the 21-year-old university student. ""But I feel like I will be protected from the virus today."" South Korea has recorded 24 cases of the novel coronavirus outbreak that emerged in neighbouring China, where more than 30,000 cases have been confirmed, and Seoul has barred entry to foreigners who have recently been in Wuhan, the epidemic's centre. Festivals, graduation ceremonies, and K-pop concerts have been cancelled over fears large events could facilitate virus transmission, and authorities have asked religious groups to co-operate in preventing it spreading.   The church went ahead with the event because it had been ""four years in the making"" as part of the celebrations of the 100th anniversary of Moon's birth, said official Jang Young-chul. But followers from China were asked not to come, he added. Nearly 6,000 identical-dressed couples from 64 countries - many of whom met for the first time in recent weeks - married in Gapyeong, a festive mood filling the venue as newlyweds took group photos and were congratulated by friends and relatives. ""GOD'S CONTROL"" Mass weddings, often held in giant sports stadiums with tens of thousands of couples, have long been a signature feature of the church, whose followers have been dubbed ""Moonies"" after its founder, who died in 2012. They began in the early 1960s, involving just a few dozen couples at first but with numbers mushrooming over the years. In 1997, 30,000 couples took part in a joint wedding in Washington, and two years later around 21,000 filled the Olympic Stadium in Seoul.   Those who choose to be matched by the church must confirm under oath that they are virgins, and after their wedding the couple must refrain from sexual relations for a minimum of 40 days. Kim Chang-seong, 27, who was marrying a woman whom he met 20 days ago, said he was not concerned about infection because the mass wedding had ""special meaning"" for him. ""By marrying a fellow church believer, I am taking a path paved by our church leaders.""   The teachings of the Unification Church are based on the Bible but with new interpretations, and Moon saw his role as completing the unfulfilled mission of Jesus to restore humanity to a state of ""sinless"" purity. While it claims a worldwide following of three million, experts suggest the core membership is far smaller. Evelyne Chimfwembe, who flew in from Botswana to attend the ceremony with her husband of 28 years, said she was not worried about the coronavirus as she believed the event would be ""under God's control"".

09 Feb 2020 01:56AM,Novel coronavirus case numbers 'stabilising' in China: WHO,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners GENEVA: The number of cases of the deadly novel coronavirus being reported on a daily basis in China is ""stabilising"", the World Health Organization said on Saturday (Feb 8). The UN health agency said this was ""good news"" but cautioned that it was too early to make any predictions about whether the virus might have peaked. ""There has been a stabilisation in the number of cases reported from Hubei,"" Michael Ryan, head of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, said at a briefing in Geneva. The central Chinese province of Hubei has been at the epicentre of the virus outbreak and has been placed under lockdown by the authorities in an effort to contain the virus. ""We're in a four-day stable period where the number of reported cases hasn't advanced. That's good news and may reflect the impact of the control measures that have been put in place,"" Ryan said. But he added that it was ""very early to make any predictions"". WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the trend was ""not really accelerating"" but also called for ""caution"". The coronavirus has infected more than 34,500 people and killed more than 700. Tedros warned against misinformation about the virus, saying it made the work of healthcare staff harder. ""We're not just battling the virus, we're also battling the trolls and conspiracy theorists that push misinformation and undermine the outbreak response,"" he said. Asked about a planned WHO-led international mission to China, he also said a list of names had been submitted to Chinese authorities and the team leader would be travelling there on Monday or Tuesday. ""The rest of the experts will also follow after that,"" he said. Asked if the mission would include members of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), he said: ""I hope so"". China has been critical of measures taken by the United States in response to the virus and has so far rejected an offer of assistance from the CDC.

Several Internet intermediaries were temporarily exempted from having to comply with correction direction requirements when POFMA came into effect on October 2019. MCI said the exemptions will be lifted on Friday “given the evolving situation with the Wuhan coronavirus”. “The Government is prepared to use all tools at its disposal to provide the public with accurate and up-to-date information, and to deal with falsehoods that may cause panic or confusion,” MCI said in a statement. A general correction direction can be issued to a media outlet, social networking platform, search engine or other Internet service providers. When Internet services are given a GCD, they are required to disseminate a correction notice in Singapore using their service to all their end‑users or users specified by the direction. On Tuesday, the POFMA Office issued a targeted correction direction to Facebook over two posts on the platform that claimed that Woodlands MRT station was closed due to the Wuhan coronavirus. A day earlier another correction notice was issued to SPH Magazines over a post on its HardwareZone Forum, which claimed that a person had died in Singapore from the Wuhan virus. “With the lifting of this exemption, Facebook, Google Search, Baidu, Twitter, and HardwareZone will be required to carry GCDs if the Act is applied to them,"" said MCI. “We have worked closely with the relevant technology companies, and appreciate the industry’s support and cooperation in our national response to this challenging situation.” The coronavirus, which originated from the city of Wuhan in China’s central Hubei province, has spread across the world with 13 confirmed cases in Singapore as of Thursday.

Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad said in a press conference on Wednesday (Feb 5) that the 45-year-old man and his nine-year-old son are now being treated in an isolation ward at Tuanku Ja’afar Hospital in Seremban, Negeri Sembilan. “They were asymptomatic (upon arrival in Malaysia), but in the end tested positive,” he said. On Tuesday, a total of 107 Malaysian citizens and their non-Malaysian spouses and children were brought back to Kuala Lumpur from Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, on a special flight. Upon arrival, two of the passengers who displayed symptoms were immediately sent to the hospital. They were later tested negative, Dr Dzulkefly said.   Following health screening at the Air Disaster Unit of Kuala Lumpur International Airport, the rest of the 105 individuals - including the father-and-son duo - were ferried to a surveillance centre at Nilai, Negeri Sembilan to be quarantined for 14 days. The two had originally shown no symptoms, but were later confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus, he explained. “They are now in a stable condition,” he said. Meanwhile, Dr Dzulkefly said a hazmat team was deployed to Kuala Lumpur City Centre, where the Petronas Twin Towers are located, to bring a Canadian lady to a hospital to check for possible coronavirus infection. While her actual illness was not ascertained yet, the minister said the immediate thing that came to mind was nCoV. “That’s why we sent a full hazmat team. We are not taking any chances. We will take all measures. Better be safe than sorry,” he said. CONTACT TRACING IN PROGRESS FOR FIRST MALAYSIAN MAN INFECTED Providing further updates on the first Malaysian who was infected with the coronavirus, Dr Dzulkefly said the ministry had identified 74 individuals who have had close contact with the patient. “Thirty-five of them had been tracked and their samples were taken. Subsequently, they will immediately undergo home surveillance. “The process of contact tracing is still undergoing ... We leave no stone unturned,” the minister said. On Tuesday, the authorities said the Malaysian man attended a conference in Singapore from Jan 16 to Jan 23 at the Grand Hyatt Hotel that involved Chinese nationals. Responding to CNA's queries, the health ministry said out of the 74, nine were his family members. Twenty-six of the 35 close contacts tested negative for coronavirus, while the remaining 9 were awaiting results. His house has also been disinfected, it said. He does not have a travel history to China, the ministry added. On Wednesday, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said a 38-year-old South Korean man, who had come into contact with the Malaysian in Singapore, had also been infected.

""We determined this was in the best interest of our employees and aligned with the US Department of Defense's decision to reduce its presence,"" it said. Earlier on Friday, people familiar with the matter said the Pentagon will reduce the size of its delegation travelling to the airshow. Ellen Lord, the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer, will no longer attend the event as the lead Pentagon representative, the people said. Other Pentagon leaders including uniformed military officials still plan to attend. The airshow will continue next week, but organisers might look to limit public visitors, Singapore said on Friday, as the country reported three more coronavirus cases that authorities have not yet linked to previous infections or travel to China. The new cases take Singapore's virus tally to 33 with the alert level raised to Orange, denoting the disease is severe and passes easily from person-to-person. Red - the highest alert level - indicates it is spreading widely. The trade portion of the airshow, held every two years, is set to begin on Feb 11. Two other aviation manufacturers, DeHavilland Canada and Viking Air, on Friday also pulled out of the airshow, citing the increased alert level. Their parent company Longview Aviation said the decision was made ""out of an abundance of caution for the well-being of our employees"".

11 Feb 2020 03:59PM,"Symptoms of novel coronavirus mild, similar to all respiratory viruses in early stage: Expert","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Among 45 people who have been infected by the novel coronavirus here as of Monday (Feb 10), at least eight of them visited a doctor twice or thrice before testing positive for the virus at a hospital. One of them, one of the first four local transmissions, even did a chest X-ray in the emergency department at a hospital and was discharged after results came back negative for pneumonia. This is because in the first week of the disease, symptoms are so mild that they mirror those in all respiratory viruses, said executive director of the National Centre of Infectious Diseases (NCID) Leo Yee Sin. At this point, the clinical factors can be non-specific and very subtle, such as “a little bit unwell, a little bit of sore throat, a little bit of cough”, Prof Leo said on Monday. She was speaking on the sidelines of a conference that brought together scientists and researchers to share their work surrounding the virus. “These are very common manifestations of all the respiratory viruses that can cause acute respiratory illness. ""So just by these clinical indicators, we cannot tell whether it’s this coronavirus or (a) thousand and one different viruses out there that can cause acute respiratory illness,” she said.  DISEASE PROGRESSES IN SECOND WEEK The pattern of the disease so far is that it is mild to begin with, and therefore “very hard” to differentiate from other viruses, but that changes in the second week, she said. ""The disease tends to be very slow moving during the first week. At the end of the first week, in the second week, you can see a much faster pace of disease progression, and mostly the lung manifestation will appear around that period,” she said. This could be one reason why the number of critical cases is increasing, she added. “As the disease progresses, you will see more severe cases. Severe cases at this point of time are still very much a lung disease, pneumonia,” she said. As of Monday, Singapore has reported 45 cases of the coronavirus and seven patients are now in critical condition while seven have recovered and been discharged. Testing for the virus can currently only be done in hospitals.   WIDER CASE DEFINITION Health Minister Gan Kim Yong last week said that his ministry has expanded the case definition for the novel coronavirus. “We are now doing proactive case finding. This means never mind a connection to China. When they have pneumonia, I want to know if this is novel coronavirus. We are investigating more cases, so we are discovering more cases,” he said. When asked whether the definition of people who could potentially get infected was expanded too late, Dr Leo said: “As we know more about the disease transmission, we continue to tweak the case definition. Things are evolving, we are responding to the changes to make the system better.” In its latest circular to doctors on Feb 4 seen by CNA, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said among those who should be referred to hospital for further management are cases who have had frequent or close contact during work with recent travellers from mainland China within the past 14 days, if they also have an acute respiratory illness of any degree of severity. General practitioners CNA spoke to said that even if a patient has had a close contact with confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, it does not mean they will be automatically classified as a suspect. Doctors have to use their discretion. That would include too large a pool as it includes healthcare workers, and this would overwhelm the healthcare system, they said. When it comes to identifying potential novel coronavirus suspect cases, general practitioner Dr Elly Sabrina said there are some factors to take into account. ""I consider if the close contact to a suspect was wearing personal protective gear and whether he had repetitive contact in an enclosed space,"" she said. She added that the considerations are arbitrary and evolve daily. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Copyright© Mediacorp 2020. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

13 Feb 2020 06:20AM,"China sees hope in coronavirus 'war' as death toll tops 1,100","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: China's leadership touted ""positive results"" on Wednesday (Feb 12) from efforts to contain the new coronavirus epidemic, but warned it still faced a ""large-scale war"" against the outbreak as the death toll passed 1,100. President Xi Jinping chaired a meeting of the ruling Politburo Standing Committee after figures showed that the number of new cases dropped for the second straight day, fuelling hopes the epidemic could peak later this month. Xi said there were ""positive results"" but warned that the country ""must not relax"" its epidemic control efforts, according to state media, as authorities have kept tens of millions of people under lockdown. China still faces a ""large-scale war"" and a ""big test"", said state broadcaster CCTV in a readout of the gathering. Authorities said on Wednesday another 97 people had died in China, raising the national toll to 1,113, while more than 44,600 people had been infected by the COVID-19 virus. 'TOO EARLY' TO PREDICT In Geneva, World Health Organisation officials warned against reaching premature conclusions on the Chinese data. ""I think it's way too early to try to predict the beginning, the middle or the end of this epidemic right now,"" said Michael Ryan, head of WHO's health emergencies programme.   The number of newly reported cases from China has stabilised, said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. ""But that has to be interpreted with extreme caution,"" he warned. ""This outbreak could go in any direction."" In Spain, organisers of the world's top mobile telecommunications trade fair, the World Mobile Congress, said the event would be cancelled following an exodus of industry heavyweights over coronavirus fears.   The GSMA, which organises the annual show, set for Barcelona, said it was cancelled due to ""the global concern regarding the coronavirus outbreak, travel concern and other circumstances."" The announcement was made just hours after Vodafone, Nokia, Deutsche Telekom, Britain's BT and Rakuten of Japan had pulled out, following in the footsteps of Intel, Facebook, Cisco and China's Vivo. The epidemic has threatened to harm the Chinese economy, the world's second-largest, with ANZ bank warning that China's first-quarter GDP growth would slow to 3.2-4.0 per cent, down from a previous projection of 5.0 per cent. It has also disrupted sporting events in China: motorsport governing body FIA announced the suspension of the Formula One Grand Prix in Shanghai, originally scheduled for Apr 19, due to the ""continued spread"" of the coronavirus. And this week's Singapore Air Show - Asia's biggest - was badly hit by exhibitors withdrawing and low attendance. Due to the impact of the virus, the OPEC oil cartel lowered its forecast for growth in global oil demand this year by nearly a fifth. While the full impact of the outbreak on the global economy remains unclear and a vaccine isn't in sight, investors appear to think the worst of the emergency has passed - and stock markets posted strong performances in Europe and the United States. ""The markets are ready to seize upon any sign of good news, so the fact there is evidence the number of new cases in China is falling was plenty of reason to push higher,"" said SpreadEx analyst Connor Campbell. US plane manufacturer Boeing, however, warned that there was ""no question"" the outbreak would hammer the aviation industry and the broader economy.   CRUISE SHIP INFECTIONS RISE The biggest cluster of cases outside China is on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan's coast. An additional 39 people on board the Diamond Princess have tested positive, raising the total number of cases to 174, while thousands of passengers and crew face a second week in quarantine. Most of the deaths and majority of cases however have been in central Hubei province, whose capital, Wuhan, is the epicentre of the outbreak. Some 56 million have been placed under virtual quarantine in the province. In a positive development, the number of new cases has fallen in Hubei for two straight days with some 1,600 reported, according to figures from the National Health Commission. Outside the province, the number of new patients has declined every day for the past week. In addition to locking down Hubei, authorities have restricted movements in several other cities far from the epicentre in its unprecedented effort to contain the virus. Several countries have banned arrivals from China, while major airlines have halted flights to and from the country, as hundreds of people have now been infected in some two dozen countries.   The case of a British man who passed on the virus to at least 11 other people - without having been in China - has raised fears of a new phase of contagion abroad. The 53-year-old man was infected while attending a conference in Singapore and then passed it on to several compatriots on holiday in the French Alps, before finally being diagnosed back in Britain.

28 Jan 2020 02:36AM,"Wuhan coronavirus has not mutated in the US, says CDC","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners WASHINGTON: US health authorities said on Monday (Jan 27) they have sequenced the genome of the first two cases of the Chinese coronavirus reported in the country and confirmed the virus has not mutated since leaving China. Nancy Messonnier, head of respiratory diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said she was planning imminent changes on measures to control and track the deadly virus, beyond the current restrictions just on travellers arriving from Wuhan, which is at the epicentre of the outbreak. ""Right now, and based on CDC's analysis of the available data, it doesn't look like the [virus] has mutated,"" she said in a telephone news conference. ""All the sequences we've extracted are similar to the one that China initially posted a couple of weeks ago,"" she said. All passengers arriving from Wuhan are currently subject to testing in five US airports, but since China has suspended all flights out of the stricken city, there are fewer and fewer travellers from there arriving in the US. The virus has also reached other Chinese provinces and China has announced that people who are infected can spread the disease before they show any symptoms of fever or respiratory difficulties. That has rendered redundant the current measures to contain the virus in the US. ""I expect that in the coming days, our travel recommendations will change,"" said Messonnier. ""I expect there will be a decision, and an announcement about that within the next day."" Despite that, the CDC still estimates the risk from the virus to Americans to be low. ""At this time in the US, this virus is not spreading in the community,"" Messonnier said. There have been five confirmed cases in the country and 110 patients have either been under observation or are currently being tested in 26 states. Aside from the five who so far tested positive, 32 have tested negative. It takes around a day to receive the test results from suspected cases because blood samples have to be sent to the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. The outbreak that began in Wuhan at the end of last year has killed more than 100 people and infected over 4,000 in China. US President Donald Trump on Monday offered any help China needed to control the outbreak which has also left tens of millions stranded during the Chinese New Year, China's biggest holiday. The CDC on Thursday raised its travel alert for the coronavirus outbreak to a level 3, recommending people avoid all nonessential travel to Wuhan, China.

04 Feb 2020 06:00PM,What we know about the locally transmitted coronavirus cases in Singapore,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Six patients in Singapore, including four with no recent travel history to China, have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced on Tuesday (Feb 4). The four cases of local transmission are linked to travellers from China, the ministry said. Another two cases are Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30. This brings the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 24. Of the four locally transmitted cases, three had ""prolonged interactions"" with recent travellers from China. Two of the Chinese travellers have since been confirmed to have been infected with the coronavirus, according to health authorities in China. ""Though four of these cases constitute a local transmission cluster, there is as yet no evidence of widespread sustained community transmission in Singapore,"" MOH said. Here is what we know about the six new cases: A tour group from China had arrived in Singapore on Jan 22. A day later, the group visited a health product shop at 24 Cavan Road in Jalan Besar, among other places. CASE 19 Case 19 is a 28-year-old Singapore permanent resident who works as a salesperson at Yong Thai Hang, a complementary health product shop that primarily serves Chinese tourists. She has no recent travel history to China. She reported having a sore throat and fever on Jan 29 and sought treatment at a GP clinic on the same day, MOH said.     She went to Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s (TTSH) emergency department on Jan 30 and was discharged after a chest X-ray came back negative for pneumonia. She did not leave her home at Jalan Bukit Merah from Jan 31 to Feb 2. On Feb 3, she was admitted to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and tested positive for the novel coronavirus past 11pm on the same day. MOH's director of services Associate Professor Kenneth Mak told reporters that the patient had not met the ""case definition"" on Jan 30 because she did not have pneumonia when she was checked at TTSH and had no recent travel history to China. The situation changed on Feb 3 when she went to SGH, where she was diagnosed with pneumonia, Assoc Prof Mak said.  In an update on Feb 5 and Feb 6, MOH announced that her husband and 6-month-old baby was also infected. Their maid (case 21) had also been infected. CASE 20 Case 20 is a 48-year-old Singaporean woman who also works as a salesperson at Yong Thai Hang. She has no recent travel history to China. The woman, who stays at Hougang Street 61, reported onset of symptoms on Jan 25 and was admitted to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 3. Details of her movements between those dates were not provided. ""Given that she is a colleague of case 19, she was classified as a suspect case and immediately isolated,"" MOH said in a press release. Test results confirmed the infection on Tuesday morning. CASE 21 Case 21 is case 19’s domestic helper. The 44-year-old Indonesian national has no recent travel history to China and resided at Jalan Bukit Merah as well. She reported onset of symptoms on Feb 2 and did not leave her place of residence. She was also admitted to SGH on Feb 3. She was tested positive for the novel coronavirus on Tuesday afternoon.   CASE 24 Case 24 is a 32-year-old Singaporean woman who works as a tour guide and brings groups of tourists to Yong Thai Hang, where cases 19 and 20 are employees. She had no recent travel history to China. She had no symptoms when she went to NCID on Feb 3, where she was immediately isolated. Test results confirmed the infection on Tuesday afternoon. ""We are also contacting individuals with profiles similar to the above four cases of local transmission, who had recent close contact with individuals with travel history to mainland China,"" said MOH.  In an update on Feb 6, MOH said that the woman's husband was tested positive for the virus. Before being isolated at NCID on Feb 4, he stayed at his home at Jalan Bukit Merah and worked as a private hire driver. He indicated that he had visited Tiong Bahru Plaza, Tiong Bahru Market and Beo Crescent Market and Food Centre. The risk of infection from transient contact, such as on public transport or in public places, is assessed to be low, MOH has said. CASES 22 AND 23 Cases 22 and 23 were among the 92 Singaporeans evacuated on Jan 30 from Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. They did not have any symptoms when they boarded the Scoot flight and they were put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore. All Singaporeans who were evacuated from Wuhan were tested for the novel coronavirus. On Monday, cases 22 and 23 tested positive, despite continuing to show no symptoms. They are warded in isolation rooms at NCID.   On Jan 31, it was announced that all new visitors with recent travel history to mainland China will not be allowed to enter Singapore. These visitors will also not be allowed to transit in Singapore. Those with Chinese passports, with the exception of Singapore permanent residents (PRs) and long-term pass holders, will also not be allowed to enter Singapore.

09 Feb 2020 12:47PM,What we know about the 3 local transmission clusters of coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The authorities have named three clusters of locally transmitted coronavirus cases in Singapore, including a possible cluster associated with The Life Church and Missions Singapore. The other two clusters are linked to health products shop Yong Thai Hang in Cavan Road and a private business meeting held at Grand Hyatt Singapore respectively. Together, the clusters involve at least 17 people including three families. Investigations on these clusters are ongoing, according to a daily update from the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Sunday (Feb 9) night, which also said that the total number of people infected here has grown to 43. Authorities on Friday raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange, following several confirmed cases without any links to previous cases or travel history to China. In its latest update, MOH also said that contact tracing is underway for seven locally transmitted cases unrelated to the clusters.

11 Feb 2020 01:09PM,Two coronavirus patients discharged from Malaysian hospitals remain in the country for now: Chinese embassy,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners KUALA LUMPUR: Two of the three novel coronavirus patients who have been discharged from Malaysian hospitals are currently still in the country, said the Chinese Embassy in Kuala Lumpur. “One of them is in Johor Bahru, while another in Kuala Lumpur,” a spokesperson told CNA in a written reply on Monday (Feb 10). Another patient, a four-year-old girl from Guangdong, left Malaysia with her family on Sunday morning, following her full recovery at Langkawi’s Sultanah Maliha Hospital, Malaysian media reported.   The coronavirus outbreak has gripped China and other countries, with more than 43,000 infections and over 1,000 deaths worldwide so far. Wuhan in Hubei province, the outbreak epicentre, is under lockdown while flights into the city have been temporarily cancelled. Malaysia, which has extended its travel ban on Chinese nationals to all provinces placed under lockdown by the Chinese government, has seen 18 confirmed cases, of whom 12 are Chinese nationals. After receiving treatment in isolation wards at medical facilities, three of the patients tested negative for the virus and were allowed to return home. The four-year-old girl aside, the other two recovered patients are a 40-year-old man discharged from Johor’s Permai Hospital on Feb 8 and a 63-year-old man discharged from Kuala Lumpur Hospital on Feb 9. Both men originated from Wuhan. When asked if there was any particular reason for the duo to remain in Malaysia, the embassy replied: “They have not requested to return to Wuhan, and we’re not privy to the reason behind their decision.” The spokesperson said that most of the patients treated in Malaysia are making good recovery. “Under the meticulous treatment of Malaysian Health Ministry, (we believe) more patients will be discharged in the near future,” the spokesperson added.   The embassy stands ready to provide assistance to Chinese nationals who contracted the virus in Malaysia, the spokesperson said. Among other things, it is helping them and their family members to extend their travel visas, with assistance from Malaysia's Immigration Department. “For those recovered, we also sort out food and accommodation, and assist them to make flight arrangements home,” the spokesperson said.

12 Feb 2020 04:09PM,Discrimination of healthcare workers due to coronavirus ‘disgraceful’: Amrin Amin,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The discrimination of some healthcare workers due to suspicions of close contact with coronavirus cases is ""disgraceful"", Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Home Affairs Amrin Amin has said. “There's one issue that I would like to comment on, which is on discrimination faced by our healthcare officers,” he told reporters on Wednesday (Feb 12). “We have read reports of nurses being asked not to take the lift, take the stairs instead. Nurses have been asked to leave the train ... Ambulance drivers being asked not to buy food, so as not to contaminate others,"" said Mr Amrin. “These are very unfortunate incidents, and it's very disgraceful.” Mr Amrin’s comments came after several reports of healthcare workers being ostracised in public due to concerns over the new virus. “It does not reflect the best of us Singaporeans,” he continued. “In times or crisis, we must stand together and stand united, and these are people, ordinary men and women who have served Singapore in this time. “Some of them have volunteered their services, come in and stepped up. I think they deserve our support and encouragement. “I urge all Singaporeans to encourage them and to recognise their contributions in this moment.”   Mr Amrin urged Singaporeans to “condemn the disgraceful acts” by a minority, and make it clear that these acts do not represent Singaporeans. “We are better than that,” he added. “And we will show Singapore and the world who we really are.” Mr Amrin said the public should not be alarmed as all emergency medical crew will wear personal protective equipment when responding to all calls, not just suspected coronavirus cases. “The ambulance, after conveying a suspect case, will be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, so the public should rest assured,” he stated. Mr Amrin was speaking at the Singapore Civil Defence Force headquarters where he met frontline officers who had attended suspected coronavirus cases. “I'm here to say thank you to the men and women who have bravely served Singapore in this moment of need,” he said. “They have stepped up. Many of them have said they are also anxious, but despite that they continue to perform duties required of them and I think they deserve to be honoured.""

01 Feb 2020 06:41AM,Wuhan coronavirus death toll rises to 259 in China with 46 new fatalities,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The number of confirmed deaths from China's coronavirus outbreak has risen to 259, as authorities in hardest-hit Hubei province on Saturday (Feb 1) reported 45 new fatalities. Another death was reported in Chongqing, bringing the total number of new deaths in the country to 46. In its daily update, the provincial health commission also said newly confirmed cases of infection in Hubei continued to grow at a steady pace, with 1,347. Nationwide there were 2,102 new cases as of Jan 31. That puts the national total at 11,791 as of Jan 31, according to the National Health Commission. Most of the country's deaths and overall cases have been in Hubei, a populous province in China's centre. The top Communist Party official in Wuhan, the central city of 11 million people where the virus first emerged in December, on Friday expressed ""remorse"" because local authorities acted too slowly. The virus is believed to have emerged in December in the provincial capital of Wuhan in a meat market that sold wild game. Last week, China's central government finally jumped into action, effectively sealing off Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province, and curbing travel across the nation of 1.4 billion people. But the epidemic has spread far and wide as Chinese people travelled across the country and abroad over the Chinese New Year holiday that started last week. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a global health emergency, but said it was not recommending any international trade or travel restrictions. It has since ballooned into a global health emergency with cases in more than 20 countries. Countries have scrambled to evacuate their nationals from Wuhan, with hundreds of US, Japanese, British, French and South Korean citizens evacuated so far, and more countries planning airlifts. A flight carrying more than 300 Indian nationals left Wuhan in the early hours of Saturday for New Delhi. About 200 US evacuees who landed in California on Wednesday have been put under a rare mandatory quarantine order for 14 days. US carriers American, United and Delta joined other airlines suspending flights to China, following the State Department travel advisory. Russia said it would evacuate more than 2,500 of its citizens holidaying on China's Hainan island, far from the epicentre of the outbreak, a day after sealing its remote far-eastern border.

10 Feb 2020 10:11AM,"Malaysia confirms sixth citizen case of coronavirus, man worked in Macau before coming home unwell","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia announced its sixth citizen case of the novel coronavirus, a 31-year-old man who worked in Macau, on Monday (Feb 10). The man had travelled to mainland China before returning to Malaysia on Feb 1, said Malaysia's Health Director-General Noor Hisham Abdullah in a press statement. He felt unwell and began coughing on Feb 3, and visited a clinic on Feb 4 and Feb 6, during which he was given medication. When he was still sick on Feb 7, the patient sought treatment at a clinic and was referred to Banting Hospital in Selangor for tests and treatment, Dr Noor Hisham said. After he was isolated, he was diagnosed with pneumonia and was admitted. Further checks showed he was suffering from severe acute respiratory infection and was closely monitored. He was subsequently transferred to Sungai Buloh Hospital. A sample taken from the patient on Sunday tested positive for the novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV. The relevant authorities have been alerted to conduct contact tracing and other necessary preventive measures for this case, said Dr Noor Hisham. “I would like to advise the residents in Banting to keep calm. The Ministry of Health has taken the relevant steps and will update with the latest developments,” he added. As of Monday, there were 18 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in Malaysia, of whom 12 were Chinese nationals.

01 Feb 2020 10:11AM,"Wuhan coronavirus: Singapore Airshow organiser 'undoubtedly' expects fewer exhibitors, visitors","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: This year's Singapore Airshow is expected to see fewer exhibitors and visitors as the country implements more stringent measures to contain the deadly Wuhan coronavirus, its organiser said. In response to queries by CNA, Experia Events said the event will continue as planned from Feb 11 to 16 with the additional measures implemented. ""While we continue to monitor the situation closely, the current expanded measures will undoubtedly see a reduction in terms of the number of expected exhibitors and visitors this year,"" it said on Friday (Jan 31) evening. ""During this period, we are working to ensure the relevant parties receive the requisite support and assurance, and remain ready and prepared to implement further enhanced measures as required by the authorities."" This comes after the Government announced on Friday that new visitors of any nationality with recent travel history to mainland China will not be allowed entry or transit in Singapore. Previously, only those with recent travel history to Hubei province were subjected to these restrictions. In addition, those with Chinese passports, with the exception of Singapore permanent residents and long-term pass holders, will not be allowed to enter Singapore. Authorities will also stop issuing all forms of new visas and suspend previously issued short-term and multiple-visit visas for those with Chinese passports. Those who hold such visas will not be allowed into Singapore. The multi-ministry task force tackling the outbreak said these measures will help prevent community spread in Singapore, hours before the Ministry of Health announced the country's three latest confirmed cases of the virus. Sixteen people in Singapore now have the Wuhan coronavirus, including a 47-year-old Singaporean who had travelled to Wuhan with her family and was one of the 92 Singaporeans who were evacuated from the city on Thursday. ""In line with the Ministry of Health announcement ... Experia Events will inform our exhibitors and visitors of the expanded measures,"" it said. ""As the well-being of visitors to the Singapore Airshow 2020 is our utmost priority, we urge visitors who feel unwell to seek medical attention promptly and not to attend the event for the welfare of all other visitors."" The organiser had earlier said in an advisory that it will improve housekeeping and refuse management protocols to maintain ""high standards"" of hygiene at the event, adding that doctors and medics will be on standby to attend to visitors who are unwell. The biennial Singapore Airshow, billed as Asia's largest defence and aerospace exhibition, attracted 80,000 visitors over a weekend in 2018, including 54,000 trade attendees from 147 countries and regions. Expected exhibitors at this year's event include the China Aviation Industrial Base and the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China. The previous edition had attracted manufacturers of commercial and military jets as well as specialists in aviation training from China. In 2018, Experia Events said exhibitors, trade attendees, visitors and tourists spent more than S$343 million on flights, accommodation, exhibition space, entertainment, shopping and food and beverages, a four per cent increase from 2016. The organiser said it will provide updates on implementing additional measures as required by the authorities in the lead up to this year's event.

03 Feb 2020 07:12AM,"China coronavirus cases exceed 17,000 nationwide","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The number of total infections in China's coronavirus outbreak has passed 17,200 nationwide with 2,829 new cases confirmed, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 3). In its daily update, the commission said there had been 57 new deaths from the virus - all in hardest-hit Hubei province except one in the southwestern megalopolis of Chongqing, bringing the national toll to 361. The fresh toll came a day after China imposed a lockdown on a major city far from the epicentre and the first fatality outside the country was reported in the Philippines.  Authorities in Hubei, the province at the epicentre of the outbreak, reported 56 new fatalities. That took the toll in China to 360, exceeding the 349 mainland fatalities from the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Struggling to contain the virus, authorities took action in the eastern city of Wenzhou on Sunday, closing roads and confining people to their homes. Wenzhou is around 800km from Wuhan, the metropolis at the heart of the health emergency. The G7 countries - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States - have all confirmed cases of the virus. They will discuss a joint response, Germany's health minister Jens Spahn said on Sunday. In Thailand, which has 19 confirmed cases, doctors said on Sunday that an elderly Chinese patient treated with a cocktail of flu and HIV drugs had shown dramatic improvement and tested negative for the virus 48 hours later. Most of the infections overseas have been detected in people who travelled from Wuhan, an industrial hub of 11 million people, or surrounding areas of Hubei province. The man who died in the Philippines was a 44-year-old from Wuhan, according to the World Health Organization, which has declared the epidemic a global health emergency. China has embarked on unprecedented efforts to contain the virus, which is believed to have jumped to humans from a Wuhan animal market, and can be transmitted among people. WENZHOU LOCKDOWN China's efforts have included extraordinary quarantines in Wuhan and surrounding cities, with all transport out banned, effectively sealing off more than 50 million people. But 10 days after locking down Wuhan, authorities imposed similar draconian measures on Wenzhou, a coastal city of nine million people in Zhejiang province, part of the eastern industrial heartland that has powered China's economic rise over recent decades.   Only one resident per household is allowed to go out every two days to buy necessities, and 46 highway toll stations have been closed, authorities announced. The city had previously closed public places such as cinemas and museums, and suspended public transport. Zhejiang has 661 confirmed infections, with 265 of those in Wenzhou, according to the government. This is the highest tally for any province in China after ground-zero Hubei. CLOSING BORDERS The United States, Australia, New Zealand and Israel have banned foreign nationals from visiting if they have been in China recently, and they have also warned their own citizens against travelling there. Mongolia, Russia and Nepal have closed their land borders. The number of countries reporting infections rose to 24 after Britain, Russia and Sweden confirmed their first cases this weekend.   There were 2,103 new confirmed cases in hardest-hit Hubei province on Monday, bringing the total infected to more than 16,480. With hospitals in Wuhan overwhelmed, China will open a military-led field hospital Monday that was built in just 10 days to treat people stricken by the virus. And with the Chinese economy suffering, the central bank announced it would release 1.2 trillion yuan (US$173 billion) on Monday to maintain liquidity in the banking system - the day markets re-open after the long holiday break. HOLIDAY ENDING The emergence of the virus coincided with the Chinese New Year, when hundreds of millions travel across the country in planes, trains and buses for family reunions. The holiday, which was scheduled to end on Friday, was extended by three days to give authorities more time to deal with the crisis.   With many due back at work on Monday, people were starting to return on planes and trains over the weekend, with almost everyone wearing face masks. Customs authorities had ordered temperature checks at all exit-entry points in Beijing, according to state media. Returning travellers were being checked and registered at residential compounds, while fever checks were in place in subway stations, offices and cafes. One 22-year-old arriving at a Beijing train station from northeastern China said her family had urged her to delay her return. ""But I was worried it would affect my job,"" she said. Security guard Du Guiliang, 47, said he would be starting back at work in Beijing on Sunday, after returning from northeast Liaoning province. ""Many colleagues (from Hubei) couldn't come back. Now, those who work the day shift at our company have to do the night shift as well,"" he said. Many businesses were to remain closed for at least another week, however, while some major cities - including Shanghai - had also extended the holiday.

06 Feb 2020 06:28AM,Commentary: Looks like containment of novel coronavirus not as effective as we had hoped,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Critical differences between the epidemiology of the novel coronavirus and SARS make containment less effective as a strategy and mitigation more urgent, says Hitoshi Oshitani. TOKYO: A novel coronavirus is rapidly spreading within China, with more cases discovered outside the country this past week. The virus is genetically close to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus , which caused a global outbreak in 2002 to 2003. Despite their similarities, however, this new virus shares few epidemiological characteristics with SARS, which was successfully contained after causing more than 8,000 cases with 774 deaths worldwide. This new virus may be more difficult to control than SARS. The number of cases has already exceeded the total number of cases of SARS – and in just one month. It is likely that the Wuhan health authorities tried to contain the new virus using the same strategy previously used for the containment of SARS. However, containment by these means looks like an less effective means to deal with this new virus compared to SARS. We have insufficient epidemiological data to understand the whole epidemiology of this novel coronavirus because we are still in the early stages of its spread. At this time, however, we have seen some critical differences between the epidemiology of SARS and this virus that may make this much more difficult to manage than SARS. HOW EFFECTIVE IS CONTAINMENT? Active and comprehensive discovery of infected individuals, rapid isolation of cases, and identification of all close contacts by contact tracing were the fundamental strategies for the containment of SARS. However, several conditions must be met for this containment strategy to be effective.   First, the majority of the infected individuals must develop typical, identifiable clinical symptoms that can be used to distinguish between the target disease and other infections. Second, only those with typical clinical symptoms can infect others. Third, infected individuals are contagious only in the late stage of illness. For SARS, these conditions were met, and quick containment was therefore possible. Most infected individuals developed severe viral pneumonia, which was distinguishable from other infections such as seasonal influenza. Furthermore, only those with severe and typical symptoms could infect others. Finally, infected individuals were contagious only in the late stage of illness. Therefore, we were able to identify most infected individuals and isolate them as soon as they developed symptoms to prevent further transmission. Eventually, all chains of transmission were interrupted, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global containment of SARS on Jul 5, 2003 - eight months after the emergence of the virus. PROBLEMS WITH CONTAINMENT In contrast, the containment strategy used for SARS has not been successful in containing this novel coronavirus. This is because this virus does not meet the aforementioned necessary conditions. Unlike SARS, some or many infected individuals developed only mild or no symptoms, precluding the identification of all possible cases. In Singapore, some Singaporeans who had come into contact with a group of Chinese tourists were diagnosed with the infection, despite two not having any signs of pneumonia when they first presented themselves to healthcare facilities.   In Japan, five out of the 565 evacuees from China tested positive for the virus despite not having any symptoms. Furthermore, limited evidence suggests that infected individuals with mild or no symptoms can be contagious. Asymptomatic infected individuals may not be a driving force for the ongoing outbreak due to a lower chance of successful transmission compared to symptomatic cases. However, if an asymptomatic individual becomes a source of the transmission chain, then contact tracing cannot be used to identify such a chain. This is a critical problem for containment. Some accounts of transmission suggest that individuals are contagious even during the incubation period, which is the duration between exposure and the onset of symptoms. There is documented evidence indicating that a traveller from China passed the virus to some of her colleagues during the incubation period in Germany, which the science community is debating over. If cases are infectious during the incubation period, it may be too late to prevent further transmission, even if we can isolate patients soon after they develop symptoms. The majority of individuals infected with SARS did not infect any other persons. During that outbreak in Singapore in 2003, more than 80 per cent of infected individuals did not pass the virus to anyone else.   There were some “super-spreader events” in which one infected individual infected many others. These were the major amplifying factor for SARS. So far, no “super-spreading event” has been documented for the novel coronavirus, but more data is needed before we can rule out such an event. Because possibly only a small fraction of cases are being detected and reported, it is difficult to know the exact transmissibility between individuals for this virus. Due to the rapidly increasing number of cases in mainland China, its transmissibility is considered to be higher than that of SARS. In addition, the world of 2020 is quite different compared to that of 2003. Many more international flights now depart from China to many more countries than before. While SARS spread to more than 30 countries and areas within eight months, the novel coronavirus has spread to more than 20 countries within one month. No sustained human-to-human transmission has been reported outside mainland China. However, “invisible transmission chains” may already have been established in some countries. Therefore, we may see a sudden increase in the number of cases when such transmission chains are fully realised. This is becoming a real possibility. SHIFT TO MITIGATION Because containment appears less feasible and effective, we must shift our objective to mitigate the impact. Thus, the most important goal right now is to reduce the mortality rate to be as low as possible. Every country should be prepared for an increasing number of severe cases. This may be more challenging in countries with limited healthcare resources. We urgently need to establish a mechanism to support these countries. It is difficult to predict how the outbreak will evolve in China and other countries, but an imminent risk persists of large outbreaks outside of China. The international community should work together, and China has a critical role in this battle. Other countries can learn from China’s current experience. For example, we must learn and distribute what measures are effective or ineffective. The WHO should continue to play a leading role for international coordination, especially with China, to fight against this global threat.

04 Feb 2020 01:38PM,South Korean tourist tests positive for novel coronavirus after visiting Thailand,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SEOUL: A South Korean woman has tested positive for coronavirus after visiting Thailand, the first foreign tourist reported to have been infected after a visit to the Southeast Asian nation. The 42-year-old, identified only as Patient 16, flew back to South Korea on Jan 19 after travelling in Thailand, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said in a statement on Tuesday (Feb 4). Treated since developing chills and other symptoms from Jan 25, she did not improve until Sunday, the KCDC added, and was confirmed positive on Tuesday, following checks at Chonnam National University Hospital. The statement did not explicitly rule out a visit to China, however. KCDC said it was too early to conclude whether the patient contracted the virus while in Thailand. ""We need detailed research through an epidemiological survey,"" Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of KCDC, told reporters. South Korea has 16 confirmed cases of the virus. The country reported its first case of local human-to-human transmission on Thursday, a 56-year-old Korean man who had contact with a previously confirmed case. He was quarantined at a hospital in Seoul. Thailand has confirmed 25 cases of the novel coronavirus. A case of human-to-human tranmission was also reported in the country - a taxi driver who did not have a record of travelling to China and is suspected to have been infected by a sick traveller. Tanarak Pipat, deputy director-general of the Department of Disease Control, said last week that the overall risk of infection in Thailand is ""still low"". Most cases reported in the country are Chinese tourists. In China, more than 20,000 have been infected by the novel coronavirus, with the death toll at 426.

05 Feb 2020 07:29PM,"Deep cleaning measures at Grand Hyatt hotel linked to Malaysian, South Korean coronavirus cases","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The Singapore hotel that hosted three guests from Malaysia and South Korea diagnosed with the coronavirus said on Thursday (Feb 6) that it has since engaged an external agency to deep clean all its guestrooms. Mr Willi Martin, general manager of Grand Hyatt Singapore said: ""The Singapore Ministry of Health is still investigating the cases with the relevant authorities and has not advised details on how, where or when these individuals were infected with the virus."" The hotel has ""elevated precautionary operational protocols"" since receiving this news, he added. Deep cleaning measures have also been extended to public areas and restaurants, and the hotel's Damai's Spa and Fitness Centre. The hotel has engaged a government-appointed external agency to conduct a thorough sanitisation and deep cleaning of the guestrooms, and is strictly following the National Environment Agency's Sanitisation and Hygiene advisory for hotel operators, said Mr Martin. Malaysia's Health Ministry announced its first citizen case of the novel coronavirus on Tuesday. According to Singapore's Ministry of Health (MOH) the 42-year-old Malaysian man had attended a business meeting at Singapore's Grand Hyatt hotel that involved Chinese nationals. The sister of the Malaysian man on Thursday also tested positive for the virus, becoming the country's first locally transmitted case. In an update on Wednesday, MOH said the Jan 20 to 22 meeting was attended by 109 participants from one company. Of those, 15 were Singapore residents and 94 were from overseas, said MOH. All of the overseas participants have left Singapore and MOH has informed the relevant health authorities, it said. Grand Hyatt's marketing communications manager Gerald Kheng confirmed that the Malaysian had stayed at the hotel on Scotts Road from Jan 16 to Jan 23, and was diagnosed more than a week after returning home to Malaysia. ""We understand that the guest first experienced symptoms following his return home and was subsequently diagnosed by local authorities in Malaysia,"" he said on Wednesday. ""The Singapore Ministry of Health is still investigating the case and has not advised details on how, where and when this individual was infected with the virus. ""At this time, we are not aware of any other confirmed or suspected cases among our hotel guests or colleagues."" He said the hotel will support local authorities as they look into the situation. TRACKING CLOSE CONTACTS On Tuesday, authorities said they are tracking the Malaysian man's close contacts. He had developed symptoms on Jan 29 and tested positive for the novel coronavirus on Feb 3, they added. Speaking to reporters at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, MOH's director of medical services Kenneth Mak said Singapore was in touch with authorities in Malaysia. “We have got excellent relations with the Malaysian health authorities, we have been cooperating bilaterally,” Associate Professor Mak said. He added: “We understand that the particular risk exposure was quite some time ago … There is a possibility that many of the people that took part in this particular meeting may (not be) in Singapore anymore.” The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said on Wednesday that a confirmed case – a 38-year-old South Korean man – had visited Singapore for a conference from Jan 18 to Jan 24. South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that the South Korean man had met with the Malaysian man who was later tested positive for the coronavirus. On Wednesday evening, South Korean authorities confirmed another case of the virus. The 36-year-old man had attended the same conference as the 38-year-old South Korean man, the Korean Herald reported. He too had come in contact with the Malaysian who tested positive for the coronavirus. Authorities have not confirmed if they met at the Grand Hyatt hotel. The South Korean man visited a local screening centre on Tuesday after becoming aware of the confirmed case in Malaysia, and was tested positive on Wednesday.

06 Feb 2020 10:21PM,Britain confirms third case of novel coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners LONDON: A third person in the United Kingdom has tested positive for novel coronavirus, England's chief medical officer said on Thursday (Feb 6). ""A further patient has tested positive for coronavirus bringing the total number of cases in the UK to three,"" Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said. ""The individual did not acquire this in the UK."" ""We are now working quickly to identify any contacts the patient has had,"" Whitty said. The patient is being transferred to a specialist health service centre. The first two people in Britain to be diagnosed with the virus are being treated at a hospital in Newcastle, northeast England, Britain's health ministry said last week. Two patients from the same family in England had previously tested positive for coronavirus, the first such cases in Britain. British health officials had previously warned that the United Kingdom was highly likely to have cases of the new type of coronavirus, which first emerged in China's central province of Hubei and has killed more than 560 people so far. Coronavirus spread among passengers of a quarantined Japanese cruise liner on Thursday and dragged down production at more global businesses, as scientists across the world searched for a vaccine. China reported its biggest daily jump in fatalities from the virus on Thursday, up 73 to 563, although there have been only two reported deaths outside mainland China. The epidemic, which has spiralled into a global health emergency, is believed to have emerged in December from a market that sold wild game in Hubei's capital Wuhan.

03 Feb 2020 06:05PM,Commentary: How effective are mass quarantines in China in curbing the spread of the novel coronavirus?,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Mass quarantines may allay public fear and provide the illusion of intervention, but they cannot be considered an evidence-based practice, says an expert. LONDON: The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. China has recorded over 17,200 cases, but under 400 deaths from the disease. As far as emerging diseases go, this virus appears relatively insipid. Despite the mild severity of this disease, over 50 million people in Hubei Province have been restricted to their region as Chinese authorities try to prevent the spread of the virus. Wuhan’s public health authorities say they are in a “state of war” and public transport has been shut down in several Chinese cities. Cordoning off ground zero is not unusual in public health emergencies. An outbreak of norovirus or salmonella may lead to restaurant closure. In the case of the novel coronavirus, the wet market from where it may have originated (in Wuhan) was similarly shut down. Removing the suspected source of the disease is necessary but not sufficient. Any public health response to a disease outbreak must prevent transmission of cases to others. And while isolation is a well-established practice for individual cases, quarantining millions of healthy people is unprecedented in public health. Across Asia, facemasks are back in vogue, with Alibaba selling 80 million over two days alone. Given the historical context, this is unsurprising. The Chinese are well acquainted with outbreaks of viral disease. Crystalline memories of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have re-emerged. But it is this very context that raises the question: Is such a drastic response warranted? ILLUSION OF INTERVENTION   Some, looking in from the outside, may welcome mass quarantine. But in reality, it is no better than the usual public health response of isolating cases and potentially high-risk contacts of cases. Going further to isolate those who have any theoretical risk of disease may allay public fear and provide the illusion of intervention, but it cannot be considered an evidence-based practice. First, the argument for mass quarantine rests on the perilous assumption that one person’s risk of infection is the same as another’s, simply because they live in the same region. We know this is not the case, particularly at an early stage in an outbreak, and that there are groups at higher risk who may be identified and targeted first before radical strategies that interfere with usual activities are considered. In fact, any impediment to the day-to-day functions of healthcare and other infrastructure can be a huge problem for disease control. Contact tracing, disease surveillance, public education and administering protective equipment, drugs or vaccines, rely on effective communication with hospitals, primary care, laboratories and other institutions, such as schools or nursing homes. Descending into a zombie-apocalypse scenario does not help in the operational coordination of complex cross-agency public health activities. Second, a Chinese public health response must protect those within the affected region as well as those outside it. The current position ignores the rights of healthy people in and around Wuhan.   If we assume all currently recorded cases are within the city of Wuhan (of approximately 11 million) and not the wider region, then we can conservatively estimate that over 99 per cent of people are not cases. While human-to-human transmission appears to be occurring, preliminary reports don’t suggest that this is a particularly infectious disease. For every one case, the WHO estimates that a further 1.4 to 2.5 (or an average of two) more people are infected. To put this in perspective, for measles, an estimated 12 to 18 people will get infected from a single case. So the vast majority of the population trapped in the region are not unwell and would be unlikely to get infected with an appropriate public health response. Such a geographical lockdown of this magnitude is not just superfluous but also introduces new health problems into the mix. The first week of quarantine has resulted in crowded hospitals, food shortages and the local economy grinding to a standstill. Amid such chaos, even the Chinese will struggle to prevent defectors from fleeing. Also, it is unclear when it would be possible to lift such a lockdown. HIGH PRICE TO PAY With cases increasing by the day, the quarantine looks like it is here to stay, but escalating economic and social pressures will loom large for decision-makers. Surely the billions the quarantine is costing the Chinese economy would be put to better use in developing new diagnostic, preventative or therapeutic technologies for the virus? A quarantine of this scale may create more problems than it solves. Other countries must be careful not to hastily imitate this if and when given the opportunity.

13 Feb 2020 06:11AM,"F&B, retail businesses in CBD feel pinch as people work from home amid coronavirus concerns","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Valentine’s Day is the occasion when Mdm Wong Li Hua makes the most money in the year. But the florist was visibly frustrated when she spoke to CNA. Sales at her shop at The Arcade have fallen by 50 per cent compared to the same period last year after Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) alert level to Orange last Friday, Mdm Wong said. Since the announcement, companies islandwide commenced their business continuity plans to limit the spread of the COVID-19. Many, including the financial institutions and technology giants that have offices in the Central Business District (CBD), have arranged to split employees’ shifts or have them work from home. Besides fewer walk-in customers because those who work in the area are staying at home, the closure of the linkways between The Arcade and Clifford Centre has caused some confusion among her customers, Mdm Wong said.   Some who finally made their way to her shop said they thought her store was closed, the florist said. “Who isn’t worried,” Mdm Wong said in Mandarin of the virus creating a dent in her business. “Every year, we rely on this occasion to earn money.” At lunchtime on Wednesday (Feb 12) afternoon, the CBD was still visibly bustling with office workers, but most owners and staff of the 13 eateries and retailers located in the area CNA spoke to said that sales are down anywhere between 10 and 50 per cent since the beginning of this week. Other shopkeepers at The Arcade also saw a dip in sales. At minimart Haja T&T Trading, its owner Haja Aladudeen said that against last week's records, his daily takings have tumbled by 40 per cent. He does not know what to do to shore up his business and can only fret in the meantime, he said.   ZTP Ginseng Birdnest supervisor Loh Ken Tiam said that the Chinese medicinal shop has seen daily earnings dip by 30 per cent compared to last week. On a normal day, the shop takes in about S$2,000 to S$3,000, he said. Over at Tanjong Pagar, the situation was similar. Tomy Chen, the co-owner of Pho Stop at Downtown Gallery, said that sales fell by 20 per cent on Monday, and 30 per cent on Tuesday and Wednesday compared to the same period last week. If dine-in sales continue to fall, Mr Chen said some staff will be transferred to their delivery kitchens located at Lavender and Katong. He is hoping that an increase in demand for food deliveries will offset the dip at their CBD outlet. Lum Von-Nie, who runs the Basil & Mint hawker stall at Amoy Road Food Centre, said that delivery orders have helped to cushion some of the dip in revenue. For example, she earned 20 per cent less on Tuesday week-on-week, but deliveries cut her losses by 10 per cent.   “It’s good that the authorities are quick to respond to false news, so hopefully that helps assure the public that there is no reason not to eat out,” Ms Lum, who runs the stall alone, said, “But yes, (I’m) bracing for the worst."" It is a difficult situation to be in, especially as F&B businesses operate on thin profit margins, said Mr Willin Low, owner of Relish@Frasers Tower. His lunch business has dropped by 45 to 55 per cent. Mr Low said he is in talks with other restaurant owners to see if they can come up with a plan collectively to tide through this period. “Hopefully regular customers and landlords will support restaurants to keep them in business,” he added. But for some others, it is business as usual. One Korean grocery store shop assistant, who asked not to be named as he was not authorised to speak, said that sales have been brisk, especially over the weekend when people came to stock up on rice and instant noodles. OFFICE STAFF WORKING FROM HOME Last Friday, the Singapore Government moved the DORSCON status to Orange. The Ministry of Health urged companies to “step up” their business continuity plan, with suggestions that employees could telecommute or be divided into separate teams. Banks, technology firms and property consultancies with offices in the CBD have heeded the advice and kickstarted their segregation strategies. United Overseas Bank (UOB) said in a media statement on Monday (Feb 10) that it activated its business continuity plans for all critical functions and services, with employees working from split sites, from home and on split shifts. Similar measures have been put in place at DBS, according to a spokesperson. Its 12,000 employees across Singapore, either work from home or from separate sites. A DBS employee was confirmed on Wednesday to be infected by the coronavirus, prompting the bank to evacuate 300 of its staff members from its offices on the 43rd floor at Tower 3 of Marina Bay Financial Centre.   Twitter, whose Asia-Pacific headquarters is located in CapitaGreen, said that they have a “cross-functional operational taskforce in place (to) take necessary measures, including work from home policies, to protect our people and our business operations”. Tech giant Facebook said that they have “taken steps to protect the health and safety of our employees”, although the company already has a flexible working approach in place. Microsoft noted a similar arrangement in their response. Facebook and Microsoft’s Singapore offices are located at Marina One and Frasers Towers, respectively. Real estate firm Colliers International, which has 350 employees in Singapore and an office in Asia Square, said that it has encouraged all its staff to work from home following the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. “This flexible work arrangement will remain in place until the end of March 2020 and we will review the need to extend it,” its managing director Tang Wei Leng said. Staff based at CBRE’s offices are also split into teams who are either working from home or at the office, the company said. Employees who are pregnant and those with prior respiratory conditions will work from home. The property consultancy has about 1,600 employees in Singapore. Four hundred are based in one of its two offices at Paya Lebar Quarter or Six Battery Road. The rest of the estimated 1,200 are based off-site in clients’ offices.

07 Feb 2020 11:28AM,Malaysia to extend travel ban to all Chinese provinces under lockdown amid coronavirus outbreak,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia will extend its temporary travel ban on Chinese nationals arriving from Hubei province and its capital Wuhan to all other provinces put under lockdown by the Chinese government. This came after the confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in Malaysia rose to 14 on Thursday (Feb 6), including four Malaysian nationals. “The Immigration Department will from now impose a travel ban on a province as soon as the Chinese government declares it under lockdown,” Deputy Prime Minister Wan Azizah Wan Ismail said in a statement on Thursday night. Dr Wan Azizah, who is also the National Disaster Management Agency (NADMA) chairman, said Malaysia’s border security will also be tightened by adding more thermal scanners and laboratory facilities to quicken test results. She added that the Foreign Affairs Ministry was making arrangements for the urgent return of 212 non-essential staff members of Malaysia’s embassy and consulate-general offices in China. The government is also prepared to assist the 34 Malaysians in Wuhan who could not return home on a special flight on Feb 4. They are unable to leave Hubei now due to the travel ban imposed by the Chinese government, Dr Wan Azizah said. To date, more than 30,000 coronavirus cases have been recorded across the globe, with more than 600 deaths.

02 Feb 2020 06:06AM,"Commentary: As a parent, I worry about my kids and the Wuhan coronavirus situation. So I’m taking action","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners News of the Wuhan coronavirus have created anxiety and fear among parents. June Yong admits she shares some of these sentiments but shares her experience on what’s getting her through. SINGAPORE: Over the past week or so, the spotlight shifted very quickly from Chinese New Year festivities to the deadly coronavirus. As a parent with three kids in primary school, I couldn’t help but feel on the edge as the day to return to school post-CNY drew near. News about the compulsory leave of absence (LOA) for teachers and students returning from China helped settle the jitters somewhat but did not remove it completely. I was also in a dilemma. As my second child was still recovering from a flu bug, I wasn’t entirely sure whether he was well enough to return to school. In the end, I kept all three at home on the first day. To be absolutely honest, I’m not sure if it was more responsible parenting or paranoia driving that decision. Apparently I wasn’t the only one who was gripped by fear, as a few of my daughter’s classmates were absent on that day too. But when she begged to go to school the next day, I relented. What kind of message would I be sending my kids if I allowed fear to steer my every course? FEAR IN THE DRIVER’S SEAT In the movie Inside Out, we get an insider perspective of what goes on in the emotional world of Riley, the main character of the show. It was fascinating to watch how each of her five basic emotions — Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger — took control at the console of her mind. In today’s virus-warped world, it is apparent that Fear is in the driver’s seat. This is the primary emotion that is causing people to grab and hoard masks, despite the government’s call to use them responsibly and only when feeling unwell. It is the emotion driving restaurant owners in Korea to put up signs saying “no Chinese allowed”. It is also the emotion that is causing us to think twice about sending our children to school. Now it is perfectly normal to be fearful, given that there are a lot of unknowns about this virus: When it is contagious — upon infection or post-symptom, how it is transmitted, who are most at risk, and how long it will take to die down. The accelerating pace of the virus spread in China and around the world is also making it hard to get a handle on the situation. As parents, we worry that the situation will turn south very quickly, and we don’t want to see our offspring suffering needlessly. So we pull out all the stops to ensure their safety, whether it is by keeping them home, driving them to and from school, skipping unnecessary events, or getting them masks. More than a week back, many of us also called on the Government to take action and prevent Hubei nationals and travellers from entering Singapore when the situation took a turn for the worse, a move that was eventually made. But the question remains: How much is safe enough? And for a parent, is school okay but not tuition and enrichment activities? How long can we maintain this state of hyper-vigilance? Last Thursday, I brought my boys for their usual badminton lessons and we practically had the entire hall to ourselves. We all hope that the virus will disappear in weeks, and that it will neither run the months-long course as SARS nor come anywhere close to the impact it had. But one thing seems certain: We have not seen the peak yet, and the number of infected cases around the world is going to rise. Elsewhere including the US, community spread has already occurred. Experts are saying the virus may continue for the next few months given how fast it’s been spreading. KEEPING ANXIETY IN CHECK My WhatsApp chat groups have been buzzing with information shared by parents on how to protect ourselves and where to get masks, sanitisers and anti-bacterial wipes. While mostly useful, it also induces anxiety. The past week, I’ve noticed moments when I felt harried and breathless, and I think it could be my body’s stress response. In the first few days of the newsbreak, I also found myself using negative terms such as “your immunity will be weak” or “the virus will make you very sick” in a bid to scare them into washing their hands properly before meals. I’ve since tried to be more measured in my word choices, so as not to create greater anxiety in my kids, using a more positive tone such as “let’s keep ourselves healthy during this period”. It may seem small in the scheme of things but this is the time to exercise leadership and role-modelling as parents. Part of this is to avoid stressing our kids out unduly. LEARNING FROM THE JAPANESE When a perceived threat is imminent and unknown, we will all experience a period of heightened fear and irrational behaviour. Because of the scarcity of masks or other health-related goods, people start to eye one another suspiciously. Every sneeze or slight clearing of throat is enough to get you stares on public transport. Caution is certainly needed but we may need time to adjust and allow other healthier emotions to take their rightful place at the wheel, perhaps those of perseverance, hope and level-headedness. In this regard, we could learn from the Japanese. Japan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. Children there are taught earthquake survival skills early on in their lives. Schools run regular earthquake drills, educating kids on the best way to stay safe during an earthquake. One common strategy taught is for children to get under their desks and hold onto their table legs until the trembling is over. If playing outside, children are taught to go to the centre of an open space to avoid falling objects. Since we will need time to bring the virus to heel, we should instill good hygiene habits in our young. From washing hands properly, to practising good cough etiquette by covering your mouth or using a mask, and handling and disposing masks carefully — if we train them up well in these areas, as a society we will enjoy stronger defences against the coronavirus and future viruses as well.   Along with staying home if one is ill instead of heading out, these are good habits we should instill in our children irrespective of news of this pandemic. A PARENT’S WISH LIST When I picked the kids up after school last week, I asked if their teachers had encouraged them to wash their hands, or given them more water breaks to hydrate their bodies. I was a tad disappointed to hear that there were no such exhortations. Granted, even if the teachers instruct, kids being kids, some may not take these seriously and just do a cursory wash. So parents cannot abdicate our responsibility in drilling our kids. Given the potential danger a community spread in schools could cause, I think more can be done in the area of educating our children on hygiene and viral protection. Experts have emphasised that this battle will not be won on the back of masks or sanitisers, but one’s level of personal hygiene. Dr Leong Hoe Nam, Infectious Disease Specialist humorously shared his golden rule in a radio interview: “Don’t touch your face. Your face is sacred.” I told this to my children and they laughed; I certainly hope it makes the message stick. I think schools have done well thus far in keeping parents abreast of the latest protective measures. Apart from daily temperature taking and implementing the LOA, they can also consider using curriculum time set aside for Health Education or PAL (Programme for Active Learning) to inculcate healthy hygiene habits. After all, real-life experiences, even crises, are often where textbook lessons can be brought to life THE CHOICES WE EXERCISE We do not know how this pandemic will pan out, but we can control our thoughts and choices today. By all means, take the necessary precautions but in order to emerge unscathed through this crisis, we need to balance fear with equal doses of calm, wit and trust. By practising good hygiene habits as a family, we can go about our daily lives like the Japanese children, with hope and optimism while constantly vigilant for the next alarm. If we manage ourselves well, this crisis could turn out to be an opportunity for us and our children to learn a kind of resilience that could shelter Singapore for years to come — no matter what virus mutations come our way.

02 Feb 2020 08:29PM,"No new cases of Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore, total remains at 18: MOH","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The number of Wuhan coronavirus cases in Singapore remained at 18 with no new cases reported on Sunday (Feb 2), the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a daily update. None of the 18 previously announced cases is critically ill. All of them remain in stable condition, and most are improving, the ministry said. As of noon on Sunday, 240 suspect cases have tested negative for 2019-nCoV, while test results for another 43 cases are pending. MOH also gave more details on an 18th confirmed case which was announced on Saturday. The 18th case, a 31 year-old Chinese woman who arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 22, reported that she was asymptomatic during her flight to Singapore. She was a travelling companion of the 12th confirmed case and was identified as a close contact on Jan 30. She reported that she had not left her room at Home Suite View Hotel in Geylang until she was transferred to a government quarantine facility in the early hours of Jan 31. While at the facility, she reported that she has had a cough since the day before. She was taken by an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), where she was immediately isolated. Tests confirmed her 2019-nCoV infection on Saturday afternoon. She is currently warded at NCID. MOH has identified 251 close contacts of the 18 cases. Of the 182 who are still in Singapore, 179 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining three close contacts, the ministry said. Singapore on Friday announced that it will widen travel restrictions to include all new visitors with recent travel history to China. The expanded measures started at 11.59pm on Saturday. As of 1pm on Sunday, the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) has refused entry to 15 travellers into Singapore, due to either their travel histories to mainland China in the last 14 days, or suspension of visa facilities. They are of six nationalities - one Spanish, one British, one Malaysian, two US, five PRC and five Indian passport holders, ICA said. On Saturday, authorities began distributing packs of four surgical masks for each Singapore household. There have been long queues for masks at pharmacies and retailers across the country.  Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing on Sunday also said that the impact of the Wuhan coronavirus situation could be ""wider, deeper and longer"" than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. The Singapore Tourism Board has announced measures to help the tourism sector, including waiving licence fees for hotels, travel agents and tour guides.

""About 20 people who presented symptoms have stayed on the tarmac"" at Istres airport in the south of France, Agnes Buzyn told journalists. They included French and non-European nationals. Army medics there were carrying out tests to establish whether or not they actually had the coronavirus and the results were expected later Sunday. Sunday's flight was the second bringing evacuees back from China to France. It was carrying 250 passengers, 65 of them French, said junior health minister Adrien Taquet. They flew out of Wuhan, where the virus was first detected, late on Saturday. This second flight was carrying people of 30 different nationalities, most of them European, Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told French broadcasters RTL. Some would stay in quarantine with the French nationals for 14 days while others would leave straight for their home countries if they showed no symptoms of the virus, he said. A first planeload arrived on Friday and are currently in quarantine at a holiday village on the Mediterranean coast. Two passengers from that flight were identified as possible cases of coronavirus, but tests on them came back negative. So far in France, only six cases of coronavirus have been detected.

04 Feb 2020 03:31PM,Commentary: Open communication and international partnerships needed to fight novel coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners The spread of the novel coronavirus will not stop without concerted action by national and international officials, says an observer. DULUTH, Minnesota: On New Year’s Eve, the Chinese government announced that it had discovered 27 cases of a new coronavirus in Wuhan, the most populous city in central China. A month later, there are now over 20,000 reported cases in 27 different countries and territories and more than 400 people are confirmed to have died. Though the overwhelming majority of cases have appeared in China, cases are now appearing throughout Asia and further abroad. This rapid spread of a novel coronavirus, combined with the lack of a known treatment, has provoked international panic. For many, this emergency brings up memories of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Over 8,000 people in nearly 30 countries and territories fell ill and 774 people died before the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak “contained” in July 2003. Beyond the human toll, the SARS outbreak led to significant economic losses, challenged the authority of the Chinese government and fostered prejudice against Asians for spreading the disease. With the new coronavirus, news stories are comparing SARS and the virus, and claiming that the economic and political effects may be even greater. CHINESE GOVERNMENT ACTIONS The spread of the virus will not stop without concerted action by national and international officials. In China, the government has allowed international experts to assist with its response, sought to counter rumours and false information and is building two new hospitals – set to be completed within two weeks – to house patients at the epicentre of the crisis.   It has also effectively quarantined almost 60 million people in 17 cities by shutting down transportation networks and restricting public gatherings. The government argues that implementing the largest ever known quarantine measures will prevent the disease from spreading. While it is attempting to quash rumours about the new disease, China is also arresting people who criticise the government’s response. The increased burden on healthcare workers has raised stress levels, too, with nurses in Hong Kong threatening to go on strike unless the city authorities close the borders with mainland China. Efforts to quarantine present additional challenges. When governments implement new measures, people try to find ways around them. As a result, it becomes even harder to trace people who may have potentially been infected. An estimated 5 million people fled Wuhan right before quarantine came into effect, according to the mayor – undermining the policy. These sorts of difficult measures also erode trust in government and public health programmes, when trust is vital in stopping any epidemic. Reports of local officials having actively tried to suppress information about the early cases of the virus fuel rumours that make it harder for people to learn the facts. This loss of trust also means that people are less likely to utilise healthcare services and won’t be treated promptly if they fall sick. INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY RESPONSE   Global partners play a key role in halting epidemics, but the international community’s response so far has been inconsistent. The WHO finally declared the novel coronavirus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) last week. This designation – only the sixth of its kind ever made by the WHO – recognises that the virus is a novel disease that has spread internationally and will likely disrupt international travel and trade. A PHEIC declaration moves the issue to the top of the global health agenda and helps to concentrate international attention and resources. It also allows the WHO to issue travel advisories and foster increased international cooperation. While a welcome move, it comes a week after the WHO refused to make such a declaration, arguing that the disease was largely confined to China. This decision gave the virus another week to take hold and spread across borders. The delay meant that countries implemented travel warnings and other policies independently without coordinated action. This has increased fears about potential economic costs as governments and private companies restrict their trade with China. Bu astonishingly, US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross suggested last week that the virus could be a boon for the US economy by bringing jobs to the United States from China. Even more troubling is the spread of fear and prejudice. Reports suggest an increase in anti-China sentiment in countries around the world, with Chinese people being blamed for causing and spreading the disease. This sort of discrimination directly works against efforts to stop the outbreak. There is much we do not yet know about the science and origins of this novel coronavirus. But we do know what steps are effective in halting outbreaks: Open communication, international partnerships and targeted action. Now is the time for policymakers in China, Asia and the rest of the world to step up to protect everyone’s health.

08 Feb 2020 02:44AM,New coronavirus infected 40 staff members in single Wuhan hospital: Study,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners WASHINGTON: Forty health care workers were infected with the novel coronavirus by patients at a single Wuhan hospital in January, a new study has found, underscoring the risks to those at the frontlines of the growing epidemic. One patient who was admitted to the surgical department was presumed to have infected 10 health care workers, according to the paper that was authored by doctors at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) on Friday (Feb 7). Seventeen patients who were hospitalised for other reasons also became infected by the coronavirus. A total of 138 patients got the virus in a period spanning Jan 1 to Jan 28, with hospital-associated transmission accounting for 41 per cent of all cases. The study comes just hours after a Chinese doctor who was punished for raising the alarm about the coronavirus died from the pathogen - sparking an outpouring of grief and anger over a worsening crisis that has now killed more than 630 people. Li Wenliang, 34, sent out a message about the new coronavirus to colleagues on December 30 in Wuhan but was later among a group of people summoned by police for ""rumor-mongering."" He later contracted the disease while treating a patient. Of the 40 infected health care workers in the JAMA study, 31 worked on general wards, seven in the emergency department, and two in the ICU. The example of the patient presumed to have infected 10 health workers highlighted the high level of danger within hospitals during the first phase of the epidemic, even though overall it is currently estimated that each patient infects on average 2.2 others. ""If true, then this confirms that some patients are likely to be far more infectious than others, and this poses further difficulties in managing their cases,"" said Michael Head, a global health expert at the University of Southampton said in a comment to the UK's Science Media Centre. Medical staff at the epicenter of the virus are overstretched and lack sufficient protective gear, the deputy governor of Hubei province admitted Thursday.

07 Feb 2020 06:18AM,Commentary: Never mind the scepticism - Indonesia has no cases of the novel coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners The response measures carried out by Indonesia’s health ministry thus far are in line with WHO's recommendations, says Qing Yuan Pang. SINGAPORE: Since the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak was declared on Dec 31, 2019, Indonesia’s Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Indonesia Country Office have been working in unison. They have also collaborated to strengthen response measures in anticipation of the coronavirus with the first public information release on Jan 8. INITIAL RESPONSE As the situation worsened in mid-Jan before the Lunar New Year holiday with the lockdown of specific cities in the Hubei province, Indonesian Minister of Health Terawan Agus Putranto announced that a budget had been allocated specifically to tackle the situation, ensuring that adequate training, logistics and standard operating procedures were provided or updated to anticipate the detection of positive cases. The ministry had also carried out webinars since Jan 24 to increase the awareness and detection of the 2019-nCoV across the public sectors including health agencies, laboratories, hospitals and environment agencies within local provincial government authorities. As part of containment efforts, the government had placed mobile containers designed to prevent containment on standby at major ports should they detect any passengers fitting the case definition and presenting with symptoms. These passengers will be transported in these containment units to pre-identified hospitals and treated appropriately. A public information portal has been established to provide daily updates on the situation. The public can also access information through their Facebook, Instagram and Twitter pages with the following hashtag: #WaspadaVirusCorona. The Ministry of Health, through the Bureau of Communication and Community Services and together with the Directorate of Health Promotion and Community Empowerment, has issued many risk communication materials and posters online and via media broadcasts. SCEPTICISM Buoyed by the confidence in his country’s preparations in handling the virus, Putranto declared on Jan 30 that ""all (steps) have been taken to make sure that there is no outbreak (in Indonesia).” According to the latest reports on Feb 1, there are no detected cases in Indonesia reported yet. Sentiments among Indonesians and on social media, however, suggest some scepticism about these bold claims. One reason for this disbelief is the close links between Indonesia and China. The world’s second-largest economy is a major investor in Indonesia, which happens to be Southeast Asia’s largest economy. In the first half of 2019, Chinese investments in Indonesia reached US$2.3 billion, making up for 16.2 per cent of total foreign investment in the country.   These close links also suggest a strong presence of Chinese citizens in Indonesia. According to Statistics Indonesia, from January to November 2019, Chinese tourists to Indonesia numbered 1.92 million, forming 12.87 per cent of all incoming tourists into the country. At the time of Putranto’s statement, there was no restriction on Chinese travelling into Indonesia. The presence of many Chinese tourists made his claim that there will be no outbreak in the country incredulous, since it is impossible to detect Chinese tourists with latent or asymptomatic infections. As an anticipatory measure, the Ministry of Health had already tightened screening at airports and ports, especially for passengers who came from China. Indonesian Director-General of Disease Prevention and Control Dr Anung Sugihantono had earlier announced on Jan 27 that the Ministry of Health had stepped up alertness early to check the body temperature of passengers arriving from China via plane or ship with a thermal scanner arriving through all ports. Such measures may have given authorities the confidence that there was no need to restrict travellers from China into the country. URGENT MEASURES However, with the WHO declaring the virus an international emergency last Friday (Jan 31), the ground has shifted beneath Indonesia. On the same day that WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus confirming that the global body had revised its risk assessment after crisis talks, in Indonesia more than 40,000 workers at a vast Chinese-controlled industrial complex in Sulawesi were quarantined in anticipation to reduce the risk of exposure to the community. That Friday, Indonesia also announced that it was preparing to evacuate nationals stranded in Wuhan with 238 people subsequently evacuated with four stating that they were comfortable with staying behind and three not being able to pass the screening to be fit to travel. The evacuated passengers, along with the flight crew, have been quarantined at a military facility on Natuna Besar Island, near the waters where the Indonesian navy had a standoff with Chinese vessels only last month over a territorial incursion incident. Although, on Feb 6, the authorities said they had yet to test those quarantined in Natuna for the virus as they are not showing any symptoms. The cost for carrying out tests can also be prohibitive, the health ministry noted.   On Feb 2, Indonesia also announced that it will temporarily stop flights to and from mainland China starting Wednesday (Feb 5) and bar visitors who have been in China for 14 days from entering or transiting in the country. Although there is no certainty that these efforts can stand up to the spread of an infectious disease, Indonesians should take comfort that its government is not ignoring the risks of an outbreak occurring. There is apprehension that detection may be lacking in Indonesia but the capabilities and capacity in the country’s health system are adequate to pick up any cases so there should be little reason to doubt their ability in this regard. ""Indonesia has a functioning early warning system and 100 hospitals in various locations that serve as referral (centres) and can handle cases with proper measures as well as effective infection prevention, WHO representative for Indonesia, Navaratnasamy Paranietharan, told Indonesian media last week. KEEP CALM In the larger scheme of things, the response measures carried out by Indonesia’s health ministry thus far is in line with the escalation recommendations as outlined in WHO’s online course for the 2019-nCoV. The WHO Country Office for Indonesia had supported the government on technical issues such as risk communication materials, clinical guidelines and response measures recommendations. Moreover, based on WHO’s report thus far, patients with the 2019-nCoV infection may present a wide range of symptoms. Most seem to have mild symptoms, with only 20 per cent progressing to a severe disease, including pneumonia, respiratory failure and in some cases death. There may be reports of asymptomatic persons being infectious and would likely fuel the spread of the disease. However, most of these cases thus far had presented only mild symptoms despite being detected with severe viral infection. Given the high human traffic volume and trade between these countries, the novel coronavirus is likely to present itself in Indonesia in the near future. But the government has taken all the necessary steps to give the country a fighting chance against the epidemic. Qing Yuan Pang served as an epidemiologist with the World Health Organization in Bangladesh and had previously spent time in Indonesia working on disaster monitoring and analysis for the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Affairs (AHA Centre) and was extensively involved in the emergency efforts for the Central Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami in 2018.

03 Feb 2020 07:12AM,"China coronavirus cases exceed 17,000 nationwide","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The number of total infections in China's coronavirus outbreak has passed 17,200 nationwide with 2,829 new cases confirmed, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 3). In its daily update, the commission said there had been 57 new deaths from the virus - all in hardest-hit Hubei province except one in the southwestern megalopolis of Chongqing, bringing the national toll to 361. The fresh toll came a day after China imposed a lockdown on a major city far from the epicentre and the first fatality outside the country was reported in the Philippines.  Authorities in Hubei, the province at the epicentre of the outbreak, reported 56 new fatalities. That took the toll in China to 360, exceeding the 349 mainland fatalities from the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Struggling to contain the virus, authorities took action in the eastern city of Wenzhou on Sunday, closing roads and confining people to their homes. Wenzhou is around 800km from Wuhan, the metropolis at the heart of the health emergency. The G7 countries - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States - have all confirmed cases of the virus. They will discuss a joint response, Germany's health minister Jens Spahn said on Sunday. In Thailand, which has 19 confirmed cases, doctors said on Sunday that an elderly Chinese patient treated with a cocktail of flu and HIV drugs had shown dramatic improvement and tested negative for the virus 48 hours later. Most of the infections overseas have been detected in people who travelled from Wuhan, an industrial hub of 11 million people, or surrounding areas of Hubei province. The man who died in the Philippines was a 44-year-old from Wuhan, according to the World Health Organization, which has declared the epidemic a global health emergency. China has embarked on unprecedented efforts to contain the virus, which is believed to have jumped to humans from a Wuhan animal market, and can be transmitted among people. WENZHOU LOCKDOWN China's efforts have included extraordinary quarantines in Wuhan and surrounding cities, with all transport out banned, effectively sealing off more than 50 million people. But 10 days after locking down Wuhan, authorities imposed similar draconian measures on Wenzhou, a coastal city of nine million people in Zhejiang province, part of the eastern industrial heartland that has powered China's economic rise over recent decades.   Only one resident per household is allowed to go out every two days to buy necessities, and 46 highway toll stations have been closed, authorities announced. The city had previously closed public places such as cinemas and museums, and suspended public transport. Zhejiang has 661 confirmed infections, with 265 of those in Wenzhou, according to the government. This is the highest tally for any province in China after ground-zero Hubei. CLOSING BORDERS The United States, Australia, New Zealand and Israel have banned foreign nationals from visiting if they have been in China recently, and they have also warned their own citizens against travelling there. Mongolia, Russia and Nepal have closed their land borders. The number of countries reporting infections rose to 24 after Britain, Russia and Sweden confirmed their first cases this weekend.   There were 2,103 new confirmed cases in hardest-hit Hubei province on Monday, bringing the total infected to more than 16,480. With hospitals in Wuhan overwhelmed, China will open a military-led field hospital Monday that was built in just 10 days to treat people stricken by the virus. And with the Chinese economy suffering, the central bank announced it would release 1.2 trillion yuan (US$173 billion) on Monday to maintain liquidity in the banking system - the day markets re-open after the long holiday break. HOLIDAY ENDING The emergence of the virus coincided with the Chinese New Year, when hundreds of millions travel across the country in planes, trains and buses for family reunions. The holiday, which was scheduled to end on Friday, was extended by three days to give authorities more time to deal with the crisis.   With many due back at work on Monday, people were starting to return on planes and trains over the weekend, with almost everyone wearing face masks. Customs authorities had ordered temperature checks at all exit-entry points in Beijing, according to state media. Returning travellers were being checked and registered at residential compounds, while fever checks were in place in subway stations, offices and cafes. One 22-year-old arriving at a Beijing train station from northeastern China said her family had urged her to delay her return. ""But I was worried it would affect my job,"" she said. Security guard Du Guiliang, 47, said he would be starting back at work in Beijing on Sunday, after returning from northeast Liaoning province. ""Many colleagues (from Hubei) couldn't come back. Now, those who work the day shift at our company have to do the night shift as well,"" he said. Many businesses were to remain closed for at least another week, however, while some major cities - including Shanghai - had also extended the holiday.

30 Jan 2020 08:47AM,3 Japanese evacuated from Wuhan have coronavirus: Health minister,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TOKYO: Three Japanese citizens among more than 200 evacuated from China have tested positive for the new coronavirus, Japan's health minister said Thursday (Jan 30). The three people arrived in Japan on Wednesday, on the first flight to evacuate Japanese citizens from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of a deadly outbreak that has killed 170 people and infected thousands. Two of the three had not shown any symptoms, the ministry said, according to NHK. The three evacuees raise the number of cases in Japan so far to 11, including two people who appear to have contracted the virus without travelling to China. ""In addition to the eight cases, among the people who returned from Wuhan yesterday, infection (with the new coronavirus) has been confirmed in one person with symptoms and two other people who have no symptoms,"" Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told parliament. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told lawmakers that the three returnees would be treated in a special medical facility. A total of 206 Japanese citizens landed at Tokyo's Haneda airport on Wednesday morning, with health professionals carrying out checks on board and at the airport, but no mandatory quarantine was planned. A second chartered flight with Japanese evacuees from Wuhan, which is under virtual lockdown, landed in Japan on Thursday with nine people showing symptoms of fever or coughing, broadcaster NHK report. At least one more chartered flight is expected in the coming days. The new cases come after authorities on Wednesday confirmed a second case involving someone who had not recently travelled to China. The woman was a tour guide who worked on the same bus as a driver who also contracted the virus without travelling to China. The driver told authorities he had driven two groups of tourists from Wuhan earlier in January and developed symptoms afterwards. ""The eighth case is the second suspected incident of human-to-human transmission in Japan,"" Kato said. ""We are in a truly new situation."" Foreign governments have been flying their citizens out of the area, as the number of deaths jumped and the World Health Organization has voiced ""grave concern"" about person-to-person spread in three other countries. The United States flew about 200 Americans out of Wuhan. They were being screened on arrival in California. France, Britain and Canada also have organised evacuations. More than 50 million people have been locked down in and around Wuhan, the central industrial city where the outbreak first began, in a bid by authorities to stop an infection that has since spread to other cities in China and to other countries. While some experts believe the new strain, known as ""2019-nCoV"", is not as deadly as SARS, alarm has grown over its rapid spread and many unknown attributes, such as how lethal it is. The effects of the virus are already weighing heavily on China's economy, the world's second-biggest, with companies cutting corporate travel and tourists cancelling trips. Various airlines are cutting flights, from British Airways and Lufthansa to Air Canada and American Airlines.

06 Feb 2020 02:22PM,What we know about the 5 families among Singapore's confirmed coronavirus cases,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: At least 12 people from five families, including a foreign domestic helper, are among the confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in Singapore so far. Of these, six are linked to the country’s first cluster of local transmission announced by authorities earlier this week. This includes the youngest patient in Singapore to date - a six-month-old baby boy who is the child of an infected couple.   Singapore had 28 confirmed cases as of Wednesday (Feb 5). Here’s what we know about these families: FAMILY 1: CASES 1 AND 3 WHO: Father, 66, and son, 37, from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore with seven other travelling companions on Jan 20. DETAILS: The 66-year-old – Singapore’s first case of the virus confirmed on Jan 23 – reported having a sore throat while on his flight to Singapore. He developed a fever the next day and began coughing. After arriving in Singapore, the man checked in to Shangri-La’s Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa. On Jan 22, he told hotel staff that he was unwell and was taken to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH), where he was isolated and diagnosed with pneumonia. He was identified to the Ministry of Health (MOH) as a suspected case at 10pm and was tested positive the following day at 6pm. He remains in isolation at SGH. The man’s son, who stayed with his father at the same hotel, became a confirmed case on Jan 24. He is also currently in isolation at SGH. Other family members travelling alongside the father and son – the wives of both men and the son’s two young children – have also come down with the infectious virus. They were among Malaysia’s first few confirmed cases after they left Singapore for Johor Bahru at about 12pm on Jan 23, before the 66-year-old man was confirmed as infected with the virus later that day. FAMILY 2: CASES 8 AND 9 WHO: A married couple – both 56-year-old Chinese nationals from Wuhan – who arrived in Singapore together on Jan 19. DETAILS: Both cases did not show symptoms during their flight to Singapore. They only developed symptoms on Jan 24 and the couple took a taxi to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) three days later. They were classified as suspect cases and placed in isolation at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). Tests confirmed the couple as having the coronavirus on Jan 28 and Jan 29. Before that, the couple had stayed with their family at their home at Lorong Lew Lian in Upper Serangoon.   FAMILY 3: CASES 13 AND 26 WHO: Mother, 73, and daughter, 42, from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore on Jan 21. DETAILS: The 73-year-old woman was a close contact of the country’s second confirmed case – a 53-year-old woman from Wuhan who also arrived in Singapore on Jan 21. The elderly woman was located on Jan 28 after MOH made multiple attempts to contact her, and she reported having developed symptoms on the same day. She was then taken to NCID, where she was isolated. She was confirmed as the 13th infected case on Jan 30. The woman had stayed at ParkRoyal Collection Pickering and Oasia Hotel Downtown, and visited Changi Airport and Jewel. She travelled by taxi and private transport. Her daughter was confirmed as being infected with the coronavirus on Feb 4. The 42-year-old had been taken by ambulance to NCID on the same day as her mother on Jan 28 after developing symptoms. She remains warded in an isolation room at NCID. FAMILY 4: CASES 24 AND 25 WHO: A married couple with no recent travel history to China. The wife is a 32-year-old female Singapore resident and her husband, 40, is a Singapore citizen. They are among the locally-transmitted cases linked to a Chinese tour group that visited health products shop Yong Thai Hang in Cavan Road. DETAILS: The 32-year-old works as a tour guide and has brought groups of tourists to Yong Thai Hang. She had gone to NCID on Feb 3 with no symptoms – although she “subsequently informed NCID on (Tuesday) night that she had developed a fever on Jan 30”, according to MOH – and was confirmed positive on Feb 4 at about 2pm. Prior to admission to NCID, the tour guide stayed at her home at Buangkok Green and worked at Jalan Besar. She had visited Hougang Polyclinic on Jan 30 and went to a supermarket near her home. Her husband was also tested positive on Feb 4. The 40-year-old man had developed a fever on Jan 24. He visited the same polyclinic as his wife on Jan 30, and self-presented at NCID four days later where he was immediately isolated. Prior to being admitted, the man had stayed at home. He worked at Diamond Industries Jewellery Company at Harbour Drive, which the tour group from China had visited as well. He had also visited Pasir Panjang Hawker Centre and travelled by public transport. Both are currently warded in isolation rooms at NCID. FAMILY 5: CASES 19, 21, 27 AND 28 WHO: A family of three – a 28-year-old female Singapore resident, a 45-year-old male Singapore citizen and a six-month-old baby boy – and their foreign domestic helper who are all linked to the first local transmission cluster. All four do not have recent travel history to China. DETAILS: The 28-year-old – case 19 – works as a salesperson at Yong Thai Hang and reported having a sore throat and fever on Jan 29. She sought treatment at a GP clinic on the same day. The following day, she went to TTSH’s emergency department and was discharged after a chest X-ray came back negative for pneumonia. She did not leave her home at Jalan Bukit Merah from Jan 31 to Feb 2. On Feb 3, she was admitted to SGH and tested positive for the novel coronavirus on the same day. She is currently warded in an isolation room at SGH. Her husband and son – cases 27 and 28 – were announced to have come down with the novel coronavirus on Feb 5. The former is currently warded at the NCID, while their six-month-old baby boy is now in an isolation room at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. Both are in stable condition. In an update on Feb 6, MOH said that the husband had developed symptoms on Feb 1 and visited a GP clinic the next day. He was subsequently isolated at the NCID. Prior to hospital admission, he stayed at his home at Jalan Bukit Merah and worked as a private hire driver, the health ministry said. He also visited Tiong Bahru Plaza, Tiong Bahru Market and Beo Crescent Market and Food Centre. In response to media queries, MOH said the six-month-old baby boy was not in any infant care facility prior to hospital admission, and was cared for at home. The family’s foreign domestic helper has also come down with the virus. The 44-year-old Indonesian woman – case 21 – reported onset of symptoms on Feb 2 and did not leave her place of residence at Jalan Bukit Merah. She was admitted to SGH on Feb 3 and tested positive the next day. Separately, a colleague of the 28-year-old salesperson is also warded with the virus at NCID.   MORE ABOUT TOUR GROUP THAT VISITED YONG THAI HANG There are now seven people infected by the coronavirus in Singapore's first cluster of local transmission, which is linked to a Chinese tour group that visited Yong Thai Hang in Cavan Road last month. The shop is a complementary health products shop that primarily serves Chinese tourists, MOH said. The tour group of 20 had arrived in Singapore on Jan 22 and left for Malaysia on Jan 24. They later came back to Singapore at about 3am on Jan 27, before leaving the country at about 6am. Two among the tour group have tested positive for the virus, MOH said on Feb 5 citing confirmation from Chinese health authorities. Besides Yong Thai Hang and Diamond Industries Jewellery Company, the group also visited various spots in Singapore, such as Meeting You Restaurant in Hamilton Road, Royal Dragon Restaurant in Havelock Road, T Galleria by DFS in Scotts Road and the D’Resort @ Downtown East in Pasir Ris.   MOH said it has been almost 14 days since the tourists visited these places. It has reached out to 142 contacts, of which “all but one are well”. “The person has been isolated as a suspect case and test results are pending,” authorities said. Contact tracing was also conducted for the crew and passengers of the departing flight on Jan 27. Five are in Singapore and have been quarantined.

09 Feb 2020 12:15AM,Grab suspends GrabShare services amid novel coronavirus outbreak,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Ride-hailing operator Grab will suspend its GrabShare service in Singapore with effect from 1am on Sunday (Feb 9), amid concerns over a novel coronavirus outbreak. ""Due to the latest developments, GrabShare services will be temporarily unavailable from Feb 9, 1am until further notice,"" the company said in a statement on Saturday. ""We appreciate your understanding while we work closely with the relevant authorities to monitor the situation,"" it added in a notice to app users. Grab's other ride-hailing services, including JustGrab, will remain available.   The Ministry of Health (MOH) late Saturday confirmed seven new cases of the novel coronavirus - including a taxi driver and a private-hire car driver. Singapore now has 40 cases of the virus. Of the 40 confirmed cases, four are in critical condition - up from two on Friday. On Friday, Singapore raised the DORSCON level to Orange following several cases of novel coronavirus without any links to previous cases or travel history to mainland China. This means the disease is deemed severe and spreads easily from person to person, but has not spread widely and is being contained.

11 Feb 2020 09:21PM,Indonesia says nothing to hide after no coronavirus cases detected,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners JAKARTA: Indonesia is not hiding anything over the coronavirus, the health minister said on Tuesday (Feb 11), after some medical researchers expressed concern that cases may have gone undetected in the world's fourth most populous country. While the virus has quickly spread from China throughout much of the rest of the region and beyond, the sprawling Southeast Asian country of more than 260 million people has not recorded any cases so far. Dozens of cases have been recorded in other regional countries including Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines, where one person has died, raising suspicions on social media in particular over a potential lack of vigilance in Indonesia. Researchers at the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health, in the United States, then said in a study last week that Indonesia should rapidly strengthen outbreak surveillance and control - especially given that it had direct flights from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus. The Harvard team said that Indonesia's lack of confirmed cases ""may suggest the potential for undetected cases"" as air travel may contribute to cases being exported from China. The virus has killed over 1,000, with more than 42,000 confirmed cases in China and 319 cases in 24 other countries. Many of the cases outside China have been in people who have a history of travelling to the country. ""We have the kits to check coronavirus and they're certified ... Nothing is concealed,"" Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto said after a cabinet meeting at the Bogor presidential palace outside Jakarta, in response to the concerns. Indonesia has tested 64 samples from suspected coronavirus infections - 62 of which were declared negative with two still being tested, health ministry Research and development agency head Siswanto said during a tour of its laboratory in Jakarta. Navaratnasamy Paranietharan, the WHO's Indonesia representative, told a conference on Tuesday: ""Indonesia has taken concrete measures and the World Health Organization is quite confident that Indonesia is ready to be able to respond to this situation."" Indonesia has barred entry to visitors who have been in China for 14 days and stopped all flights to and from there. Vivi Setiawaty, another health ministry official, said it was unclear why Indonesia had not seen any cases but said authorities were better prepared since facing H5N1 avian influenza from 2005. ""We remain cautious,"" she told reporters. Indonesia has readied 100 hospitals across the archipelago including three in Jakarta and has also quarantined more than 240 of its citizens evacuated from Hubei province, home to Wuhan, to the island of Natuna, north of Borneo. The WHO's Paranietharan said it appeared unlikely, as some have suggested, that the hot tropical climate could be a factor in curbing cases though more data would be required to be sure. ""It doesn't make sense at this point whether that could be the reason why we don't have coronavirus cases in Indonesia,"" Paranietharan said.

31 Jan 2020 05:50PM,UK confirms first 2 cases of Wuhan coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners LONDON: Two patients from the same family in England have tested positive for coronavirus, the first such cases in Britain, England's chief medical officer said on Friday (Jan 31). British health officials had previously warned that the United Kingdom was highly likely to have cases of the new type of coronavirus, which first emerged in China's central province of Hubei and has killed 213 people so far. ""The patients are receiving specialist National Health Service care, and we are using tried and tested infection control procedures to prevent further spread of the virus,"" England's chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said. ""The NHS is extremely well-prepared and used to managing infections and we are already working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients had, to prevent further spread,"" he added. Whitty said he would not reveal where in England the infection had occurred, to protect patient confidentiality. On Thursday, Britain raised the perceived risk level to the country from an outbreak of coronavirus in China to moderate from low after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency. A plane carrying 83 British and 27 foreign nationals from Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, is due to arrive in Britain later on Friday with those returning quarantined for 14 days at a National Health Service facility in northwest England.

07 Feb 2020 03:21PM,Four overseas cases of novel coronavirus linked to Singapore: Here’s what we know,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: As countries around the world report more cases of coronavirus and try to establish the source of each infection, attention has turned to an international business conference at Singapore's Grand Hyatt hotel last month. Malaysia and South Korea have as of Friday (Feb 7) confirmed three cases of the novel coronavirus linked to that conference. The UK also has one patient with the virus who had travelled to Singapore, although no link to the conference has been reported. The authorities in Singapore have not revealed which company organised the conference, but it has been reported that it was an event by Servomex, which describes itself as a ""provider of reliable, accurate and stable gas measurements"". A source has also told CNA that the event was organised by the company, which was founded in the UK and has worldwide offices. CNA contacted Servomex's office in Singapore for comment, but the company did not respond. There were over 31,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus worldwide as of Friday morning. There have been two deaths reported outside of mainland China so far, one in the Philippines and one in Hong Kong. This is what we know about the four international cases linked to Singapore: MALAYSIA WHO: A 42-year-old man from Selangor was the first Malaysian citizen to contract the novel coronavirus. DETAILS: Singapore's Health Ministry said on Tuesday that the man had been in Singapore from Jan 16 to Jan 23 for the business meeting, which also had Chinese nationals in attendance. The Malaysian developed symptoms a week after returning to Malaysia, and tested positive for the virus on Feb 3. Malaysia's Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad on Tuesday said that the man was in a stable condition and receiving treatment at a Sungai Buloh Hospital. SOUTH KOREA WHO: A 36-year-old man and a 38-year-old man who attended the conference in Singapore. DETAILS: Media reports on Wednesday said that the men had come into contact with the Malaysian who had tested positive for the virus. The 38-year-old developed a fever two days after he returned to South Korea. Although he visited a hospital, he was not suspected to be infected as he had not been to China recently, reported the Korea Joongang Daily. However, he did not get better and visited two other hospitals. He received a call from the Malaysian on Monday, who told him that he had contracted the coronavirus. The South Korean then contacted a community health centre on Tuesday and was later tested positive for the virus. UNITED KINGDOM WHO: A middle-aged man who travelled to Singapore. DETAILS: He became the UK's third confirmed case of the novel coronavirus, reported The Guardian on Thursday. He is the first British national to contract the virus. After confirming that he had travelled to the UK from outside China, UK officials placed doctors on alert for cases of people returning from countries previously not considered a risk, The Guardian reported. He is the fourth overseas case linked to Singapore. TIMES CULTURAL ARTS LION DANCE TROUPE Lion dance troupe Times Cultural Arts performed at the Servomex conference at the Grand Hyatt hotel level one ballroom in the early morning of Jan 20. A member of the troupe confirmed the performance took place and told CNA on Thursday that they have not been in contact with any authorities after performing at the hotel. “We didn’t have much concern because it is just a five minute concert. And we didn’t have contact with the guests, because (we were) performing on a stage.” He added that they were engaged by an events company, and did not interact directly with any delegates. The lion dance troupe uploaded a series of photos of the performance on Facebook on Jan 20. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Copyright© Mediacorp 2020. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

27 Jan 2020 01:43PM,Australia confirms fifth coronavirus case from last flight out of Wuhan,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners MELBOURNE: Australia confirmed on Monday (Jan 27) its fifth case of a new coronavirus, with health officials saying the case involved a 21-year-old woman who was on the last flight out of the Chinese city of Wuhan to Sydney before China imposed a travel ban. The coronavirus, which is believed to have originated in a wildlife market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has killed 80 people, all of them in China, and infected more than 2,700, the vast majority in China. The woman travelled on a direct flight to Sydney from Wuhan and developed symptoms within 24 hours and went to an emergency department, New South Wales Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant told reporters. ""The patient was immediately put into isolation,"" Chant said. Officials were tracing ""a couple of very low-level contacts"" related to the woman, Chant said. Australia's first four cases were confirmed on Saturday, with one in Melbourne and three in Sydney, with health officials saying they were expecting more, given the volume of travel between Australia and China. Australian officials said on Monday they are working with Chinese authorities on how to evacuate about 100 Australian children and young people out of Wuhan. ""We are working on a number of fronts, firstly to make sure ... that there is support for those Australians and we are also working on, as are other countries, to try to secure their ability to return to Australia,"" Health Minister Greg Hunt told Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio on Monday morning. Foreign Minister Marise Payne told the 3AW talk radio that the government did not have a ""definite"" number of Australians in Wuhan, or in Hubei province, as there were a significant number with dual citizenships, some of whom may not have travelled on Australian passports.

05 Feb 2020 12:12PM,3 new coronavirus cases in South Korea; 2 men had travelled to Singapore for conference,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SEOUL: South Korea has confirmed three more cases of the novel coronavirus, including two men who had attended a business meeting at Singapore's Grand Hyatt hotel last month. South Korean media reported that they were in Singapore for work and came into contact with a Malaysian who has since tested positive for the virus. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said on Wednesday (Feb 5) that the 17th case, a 38-year-old Korean man, visited Singapore for a conference from Jan 18 to Jan 24.  The man had a meal with the Malaysian man, as well as several other South Koreans during the conference, reported newspaper Joongang Ilbo. The 38-year-old developed a fever two days after he returned to South Korea, Korea Joongang Daily reported. He went to hospital, but was not classified as a suspected coronavirus patient as he had not been to China recently, said the report. However, he did not get better and went to two other hospitals. On Monday, he got a call from the Malaysian man who told him he had been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, reported the news outlet. The South Korean then contacted a community health centre on Tuesday and was subsequently taken to hospital. He tested positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday. The 42-year-old Malaysian man was the country's first citizen case of the novel coronavirus, bringing the total number of infected patients in Malaysia to 10. He was in Singapore from Jan 16 to Jan 23 for a business meeting at the Grand Hyatt Hotel that involved Chinese nationals. On Tuesday, Singapore authorities said that they were tracking the contacts of the Malaysian man, who developed symptoms on Jan 29 and subsequently tested positive for the novel coronavirus on Feb 3, nearly a week after he returned to Malaysia. Singapore’s Ministry of Health (MOH) said it has initiated epidemiological investigations and contact tracing to identify the individuals who had close contact with the case. South Korea's 18th case, a 21-year-old Korean woman, is a daughter of the 16th confirmed case in South Korea. While in isolation, she tested positive on Wednesday. Epidemiological investigation and contact tracing are underway, said the KCDC. On Wednesday evening, South Korean authorities confirmed another case of the virus, taking the country's total to 19, local media reported. The latest case, a 36-year-old man, had attended the same conference in Singapore as the previously confirmed 38-year-old South Korean man, reported The Korea Herald. He too had come into contact with the Malaysian who tested positive for the virus. A spokesman for the Grand Hyatt Hotel confirmed that the Malaysian had stayed at the hotel for a week in mid-January but he did not comment on meetings held at the hotel. The hotel has been deep cleaned and it is not aware of any other cases among its hotel guests or staff, he said. In an update on Wednesday, MOH said the Jan 20 to 22 meeting was attended by 109 participants from one company. Of those, 15 were Singapore residents and 94 were from overseas, said MOH. All of the overseas participants have left Singapore and MOH has informed the relevant health authorities, it said. The number of confirmed infections in China's coronavirus outbreak has reached 24,324 nationwide with 3,887 new cases reported, the National Health Commission said. The disease is believed to have emerged in December in a Wuhan market that sold wild animals, and spread rapidly as people travelled for the Chinese New Year holiday in January. The novel coronavirus has continued to spread with Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand on Tuesday reporting new infections that were not imported from China. CNA has reached out to Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more details on the South Korean patient.

04 Feb 2020 09:07PM,Novel coronavirus patient discharged from NCID after recovery: MOH,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: A patient who was infected with the novel coronavirus has recovered and was discharged from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Tuesday (Feb 4). The patient, a 35-year-old man from Wuhan who was Singapore's seventh confirmed case, has been ""comprehensively tested negative"" for the virus, the ministry added. ""We discharged one patient today ... all his symptoms had fully resolved and he's had consecutive tests over three days where the tests were all negative,"" MOH's director of medical services Kenneth Mak said at a press conference. ""We are quite confident that, in fact, he has no longer got any infection there."" The man had tested positive for the coronavirus on Jan 27. He had arrived in Singapore on Jan 23 and went to Raffles Hospital after he developed symptoms on Jan 24. He was then transferred to NCID by private ambulance. Doctors are continuing to watch the infected patients closely, Assoc Prof Mak said, adding that another patient is being prepared for the ""possibility of discharge over the next few days"". ""We cannot commit just yet, because it is a decision that the doctors (will have to) make as they review the patient on a day-to-day basis. And therefore it would be premature for me to say that he would definitely be discharged,"" he said.  PATIENTS WELL, NONE IN ICU There are a ""number of patients"" who are well, Assoc Prof Mak said, noting that at least three patients have no symptoms. Five of the patients have been given ""some oxygen"" to support their breathing, he said, adding that this is ""not surprising in view of the fact that they had pneumonia"". ""This is basically to support them,"" he said. ""None of them are in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit), none of them are critically ill at this point in time.""  On Tuesday, MOH announced Singapore's first locally transmitted cases among six new cases of the novel coronavirus, bringing the total to 24. Four people with no recent travel history to China have tested positive for the coronavirus, MOH said. The other two cases are Singapore residents who had been evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30.  As of noon on Tuesday, 289 suspect cases have tested negative for the novel coronavirus, MOH said. Test results for the remaining 20 cases are pending. Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. As of noon on Tuesday, MOH has identified 311 close contacts. Of the 239 who are still in Singapore, 234 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. ""Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining five close contacts,"" the ministry added. Singapore on Saturday widened travel restrictions to stop all new visitors of any nationality with recent travel history to mainland China from entering Singapore. These visitors are also not allowed to transit in Singapore. The coronavirus has killed more than 420 people and infected more than 20,000 around the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the virus outbreak a global emergency.

11 Feb 2020 10:31AM,"Singapore tourism to take 'significant hit' in 2020 due to coronavirus, up to 30% fewer visitors expected","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The tourism sector will take a “significant hit”, with visitor arrivals estimated to fall by 25 per cent to 30 per cent this year due to the novel coronavirus outbreak, said the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) on Tuesday (Feb 11). The coronavirus outbreak has significantly impacted visitor arrivals, especially from China, which accounts for about 20 per cent of international visitor arrivals here, said STB in a media release. There were about 3.6 million visitors from China in 2019. Compared to 2018, there was a 12 per cent increase in visitors from Tier 2 Chinese cities like Jinan, Ningbo and Xiamen, it added. China was also Singapore’s top revenue market in the first three quarters of 2019, accounting for S$3.2 billion in tourism receipts excluding the sightseeing, gaming and entertainment segments, up by 2 per cent from 2018. “Visitor arrivals from STB’s other key source markets are also expected to fall due to lower travel confidence globally,” said STB. Singapore is losing an average of 18,000 to 20,000 international visitors per day and most of the lost visitor arrivals are Chinese due to travel restrictions on both sides, STB chief executive Keith Tan told media on Tuesday. He noted that the estimated decrease in visitor arrivals could change depending on how long the situation in China lasts, how long the situation in Singapore and regional economies lasts, and how long it will take for traveller demand to return. He also added that the decline in tourism receipts would be ""roughly in line"" with the decline in visitor arrivals. “We believe that the situation this year will be at least as severe as the situation we faced in 2003 during SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), probably worse.” MORE RELIANT ON CHINA FOR TOURISM NOW Adding that Singapore is more reliant on China for tourism now compared to when the SARS outbreak hit in 2003, Mr Tan noted that China accounted for just 9 per cent of visitor arrivals that year. As a result, Singapore will probably take longer to recover from the novel coronavirus outbreak than the SARS outbreak in 2003, said Mr Tan. Singapore's tourism sector saw positive year-on-year results about seven to eight months after the World Health Organization declared Singapore SARS free, he added. However, after four years of consecutive growth, the tourism authorities said the sector is aiming for a strong recovery, with a pipeline of tourism investments and efforts to build new capabilities. “Our destination remains attractive, we have a strong pipeline of tourism products, and our market portfolio is diverse,” said Mr Tan. “The growth that we have enjoyed over the past four years reflects our strong tourism fundamentals,” he added. The Government will also form a public-private sector Tourism Recovery Action Task Force (TRAC) to lay out the plans for recovery and future growth, said STB. The Task Force will comprise tourism leaders from the public and private sectors, and it will work to identify opportunities arising from the coronavirus outbreak, boost confidence in Singapore’s tourism spots and create recovery plans. The statutory board had announced on Feb 2 that licence fees for hotels, travel agents and tour guides would be waived to help Singapore’s tourism sector, which has been “directly affected” by the coronavirus outbreak. STB will also defray the cleaning costs of hotels that provided accommodation to the confirmed and suspected cases of the coronavirus. Full details of the overall package of relief measures will be announced at Budget 2020 on Feb 18. TOURISM BUSINESSES AFFECTED Business and visitor numbers for Sentosa have fallen by 20 to 50 per cent, said Mr Quek Swee Kuan, chief executive of Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC). The island had seen a 17 to 19 per cent growth in local visitorship until the virus hit Singapore, he added. Adding that Sentosa plans to waive all admission fees for the March school holidays, he also said that attractions on the island are considering different options, for example, closing on certain days of the week. Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa and Village Hotel Sentosa, the hotels that saw two guests who later became Singapore’s first and fourth confirmed cases respectively, were impacted by the news at first, said Mr Quek. “But over time now, the situation has stabilised and generally the tourists have got confidence in Singapore and Sentosa hotels. And the hotels have been complying with the MOH (Ministry of Health) guidelines to ensure that the confidence in their product remains intact.” With visitor arrivals expected to drop, hotels will use the downtime to retrain workers and conduct renovations and repairs, said Ms Kwee Wei-Lin, president of the Singapore Hotel Association. ""Hotels are taking the time (to do so), because during 90 per cent occupancy we didn't have the ability to do so; so we're fast-forwarding a lot of these renovations,"" she said. ""We got support from the Government for that during SARS, and we are doing the same thing again."" When asked whether hotels have plans to lay off or retrench staff in light of the downturn, Ms Kwee noted that there were no layoffs during the SARS period and that the hotels hope to return with all their staff. As the coronavirus situation is expected to persist, the tourism board will continue to identify ""targeted and effective ways” to support the industry and its employees, it said. STB will also maintain its plans to enhance Singapore’s destination attractiveness, with work progressing on the Mandai Nature Precinct, the Jurong Lake District, the Sentosa-Brani masterplan, the rejuvenation of Orchard Road and the expansion of the Integrated Resorts. “It is more important than ever to invest in tourism to support our businesses, build confidence in tourism, and boost our destination attractiveness – so that when things start to improve, Singapore can ride on the recovery for strong growth,” said Mr Tan. “STB remains committed to our mid- to long-term tourism plans, to ensure that Singapore has a steady pipeline of new and repeat visitors.” VISITOR ARRIVALS, TOURISM RECEIPTS GREW IN 2019 Singapore saw growth in visitor arrivals and tourism receipts for a fourth consecutive year in 2019. Visitor arrivals rose 3.3 per cent to a total of 19.1 million visitors, and they spent a total of S$27.1 billion in tourism receipts, 0.5 per cent more than in 2018. After China, Indonesia and India accounted for the second and third-most number of visitors to Singapore, with about 3.1 million and 1.4 million visitors respectively. Singapore also saw a 13 per cent increase in visitors and a 14 per cent increase in tourism receipts from the United States. This could be attributed partly to greater flight connectivity between Singapore and the United States, with new non-stop flights launched in 2019. SECTORAL PERFORMANCE While the Business Travel and Meetings, Incentive Travel, Conventions and Exhibitions (BTMICE) sector fell 7 per cent year-on-year to S$3.2 billion, Singapore continues to attract leading BTMICE events, STB said. The hotel industry performed well in 2019, with growth registered across all categories. Total gazetted hotel room revenue stood at S$4.2 billion in 2019, as average room and occupancy rates rose. Cruise passenger throughput fell 2.5 per cent to reach 1.8 million passengers. This decline is largely attributed to the dry docking of Royal Caribbean International’s Voyager of the Seas in Singapore for over a month to undergo refurbishment works, the tourism board said. However, foreign cruise throughput grew by 3.5 per cent while ship calls rose 3.2 per cent to 414, with more European liners such as AIDA Cruises and Marella Cruises contributing to the growth. Demand for cruise remained strong in 2019, with Royal Caribbean International and Genting seeing healthy occupancy for their ships, STB said.

On Thursday, Communist-ruled Vietnam quarantined a rural commune of 10,000 people near Hanoi because of fears the coronavirus could spread there. Sixteen people in Vietnam have tested positive for the virus.

13 Feb 2020 02:15PM,"Vietnam quarantines commune of 10,000 over coronavirus","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners VINH PHUC: Villages in Vietnam with 10,000 people close to the nation's capital were placed under quarantine on Thursday (Feb 13) after six cases of the deadly new coronavirus were discovered there, authorities said. The locking down of the commune of Son Loi, about 40km from Hanoi, is the first mass quarantine outside of China since the virus emerged from a central Chinese city late last year. ""As of Feb 13, 2020, we will urgently implement the task of isolation and quarantine of the epidemic area in Son Loi commune,"" said a health ministry statement. ""The timeline... is for 20 days"". Son Loi is a farming region made up of several villages. The health ministry previously said five people in Son Loi had been infected with the virus, and on Thursday reported a sixth case. On Thursday, checkpoints were set up around the commune, according to AFP reporters in Binh Xuyen, a district on the outskirts of Son Loi.  Health officials wearing protective suits sprayed disinfectant on vehicles by the checkpoints. Villager Tran Van Minh told AFP that authorities had already advised residents to avoid large gatherings. ""Life has been badly affected,"" he told AFP by phone, adding that much of the labour force is reliant on jobs in construction and house painting. ""Now we cannot get out and even if we do, clients don't welcome us that much as before."" More than 1,350 people have died in China from the virus, and nearly 60,000 others have been infected, since it was first detected in the Hubei province in early January. China has imposed unprecedented quarantines across Hubei, locking in about 56 million people, in a bid to stop it spreading. Tens of millions of others cities far from the epicentre are also enduring travel restrictions. The virus has also had massive ramifications globally, with many countries banning travellers from China in a bid to stop people spreading the disease. Vietnam, which shares a porous border with China, has 16 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, including those in Son Loi. Vietnam had banned all flights to and from mainland China in a bid to stop the virus from spreading.

04 Feb 2020 02:44PM,Malaysia confirms first citizen case of novel coronavirus; man was in Singapore for meeting attended by Chinese delegates,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia on Tuesday (Feb 4) confirmed the country's first citizen case of the novel coronavirus, bringing the total number of infected patients in the country to 10. Malaysian Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad said the man from Selangor is in stable condition and receiving treatment at Sungai Buloh Hospital. Singapore’s Ministry of Health (MOH) on Tuesday said the Malaysian national was in Singapore from Jan 16 to Jan 23 for a business meeting at the Grand Hyatt Hotel that involved Chinese nationals. After his return to Malaysia, the 42-year-old man developed symptoms and subsequently tested positive for the novel coronavirus on Feb 3. MOH said it has initiated epidemiological investigations and contact tracing to identify the individuals who had close contact with the cases. The man started showing symptoms on Jan 29, nearly a week after he returned to Malaysia, according to Malaysian authorities. The man's immediate family will also be put under ""home surveillance"" for 14 days, Dr Dzulkefly added. Speaking to reporters at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, MOH's director of medical services Kenneth Mak said Singapore was in touch with authorities in Malaysia. “We have got excellent relations with the Malaysian health authorities, we have been cooperating bilaterally,” Associate Professor Mak said. He added: “We understand that the particular risk exposure was quite some time ago … There is a possibility that many of the people that took part in this particular meeting may (not be) in Singapore anymore.” The other confirmed case on Tuesday in Malaysia was a 63-year-old man from Wuhan, who entered Malaysia via Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Jan 18. He is now in stable condition and being treated at the Kuala Lumpur Hospital. Another 20 suspected cases are currently awaiting further test results, Dr Dzulkefly added. Malaysia previously reported a total of eight coronavirus cases as of Jan 30, all of whom were Chinese nationals. The country's first three cases of the infection are relatives of a 66-year-old man who was confirmed by Singaporean health authorities to have tested positive for the virus. The three Chinese nationals had been quarantined in a hotel in Johor Bahru before they were admitted to Sungai Buloh Hospital in Kuala Lumpur.

All three cases recently travelled to China's Wuhan, where the virus originated. THREE NEW CASES The 14th case is a 31-year-old Chinese national with a Singapore work pass. He arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 26, and reported to be asymptomatic on his flight but developed symptoms on Jan 28. He sought medical treatment at a clinic on Thursday and was taken to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) in an ambulance. The man tested positive for the coronavirus at about 11pm on Thursday. He is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID. Prior to admission, the man stayed at home in Jurong East Street 13. The 15th case is a 47-year-old Singaporean, who had travelled to Wuhan with her family and was one of the 92 Singaporeans who were evacuated from the city on Thursday. She was asymptomatic when she boarded the flight, but was found to have a fever during the medical screening at Changi Airport and was taken to NCID. She tested positive for the coronavirus at about 2pm on Friday and is warded in an isolation room at NCID. The 16th case is a 38-year-old Chinese man who arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 22. He tested positive for the coronavirus at about 2pm on Friday and is currently warded in an isolation room at the Singapore General Hospital. All three cases are in stable condition, said MOH. PREVIOUS CASES ALL IN STABLE CONDITION: MOH The death toll in China has risen to 213, with nearly 10,000 infected, according to official figures released on Friday. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the situation a global emergency. All of the 13 previously confirmed cases in Singapore came from Wuhan in Hubei province. The first case of the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore was confirmed on Jan 23 - about a month after the first cases were reported in the Chinese city. The seven men and six women, aged between 31 and 73, are being treated at isolation wards at NCID, Changi General Hospital, Singapore General Hospital and Sengkang General Hospital. In its press release on Friday, MOH shared more information about the 13th confirmed case, a 73-year-old woman who arrived in Singapore on Jan 21. The ministry said she was a close contact of the second confirmed case and multiple attempts were made to contact her. She was located on Jan 28 and reported having developed symptoms on the same day. The woman was taken to NCID, where she was isolated, and she tested positive for the coronavirus at about 2pm on Thursday. MOH said that prior to her admission, the woman stayed at ParkRoyal Collection Pickering and Oasia Hotel Downtown, and visited Changi Airport and Jewel. She travelled by taxi and private transport. None of the 13 previously confirmed cases are critically ill, said the ministry. ""All of them remain in stable condition and most are improving,"" it added. As of noon on Friday, 198 of the suspected cases have tested negative for the virus. Test results for the remaining 35 cases are pending. MOH also said that it has identified 202 close contacts as of noon on Friday. Of the 162 who are still in Singapore, 156 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining six close contacts, said MOH.  Singapore on Friday announced that it will widen travel restrictions to include all new visitors with recent travel history to China. China also said it will send charter planes to bring home citizens from Hubei who are overseas ""as soon as possible"". The announcement came as a number of airlines, including Singapore Airlines and Scoot, announced they were halting or reducing flights to China as the country tackles the spread of the virus. In a bid to contain the possible spread of the virus, a total of 967 students and employees from schools in Singapore have been placed on leave of absence because of their recent travel history to China. On Saturday, authorities will begin distributing packs of four surgical masks for each Singapore household. There have been long queues for masks at pharmacies and retailers across the country.  Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing on Thursday reassured people that Singapore will have enough masks, provided the supply is managed ""appropriately"". Retailers were also warned against profiteering. A letter of demand was sent to retailer Deen Express after complaints of masks being sold at high prices at its store. The retailer will have to explain to the Price Controller the “basis of their selling prices for the sale of masks, including their cost price and profit margins”. Mr Chan discouraged people from panic buying and hoarding masks, saying it could ""jeopardise the entire system"".  Medical experts CNA spoke to cautioned that masks may offer a ""false sense of security"" if they are used wrongly by people protecting themselves against viruses. They should be used by people who do not feel well and are coughing, so as to protect others, a WHO representative said.

10 Feb 2020 08:24PM,"2 new coronavirus cases in Singapore, including Certis Cisco employee who served quarantine orders","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore reported two more confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus on Monday (Feb 10), the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a daily update. One is a Certis Cisco employee who served quarantine orders on two people from Wuhan, and the other is a two-year-old girl who was one of the Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30. This brings the number of cases in Singapore to 45, with seven in critical condition. One more patient has been discharged, meaning seven have now fully recovered from the virus.     A total of 23 cases in Singapore are local transmissions. CASE 44 Case 44 is a 37-year-old Singaporean man who lives at Sembawang Drive and works at the Certis Cisco Centre at 20 Jalan Afifi in Paya Lebar. He has no recent travel history to China. He reported the onset of symptoms on Jan 31, and sought treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 2. He went to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital on Feb 6, where he was isolated and warded. He tested positive for the coronavirus on Feb 9. Before having symptoms, he served quarantine orders on two people from Wuhan who subsequently tested positive for the infection. After the onset of symptoms, he did not serve any quarantine orders. Prior to being admitted to hospital, he had been on duty at Chingay 2020. Chingay took place on Jan 31 and Feb 1. Certis said in a statement it is helping the authorities with their investigations and providing ""all necessary assistance"" to the employee and his family. CNA has contacted Certis for more information. CASE 45 Case 45 is a two-year-old Singaporean girl. She was one of the 92 Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan on a Scoot flight on Jan 30. She did not have symptoms when she boarded the flight, and was placed under quarantine after landing in Singapore. She was referred to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital on Feb 7 based on initial test results and isolated. She was confirmed as having the infection on Feb 10. CONTACT TRACING As of noon on Monday, 581 of the suspect cases have tested negative for the novel coronavirus. Test results for the remaining 39 cases are pending. Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. As of Monday noon, MOH has identified 1,026 close contacts. Of the 927 who are still in Singapore, 896 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining 31 close contacts. The coronavirus epidemic has killed more than 900 people and infected more than 40,000, most of them in mainland China.

31 Jan 2020 02:28AM,"US confirms first human spread of Wuhan coronavirus, tells citizens 'do not travel' to China","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners WASHINGTON: The husband of an Illinois woman diagnosed with coronavirus after returning from a trip to China has also become infected, marking the first known person-to-person transmission of the disease within the United States, health authorities said on Thursday (Jan 30). The latest Illinois case brought the tally of confirmed US coronavirus infections to six, none fatal, according to the Centers for Disease and Prevention (CDC), as the number of Americans potentially exposed to the virus and placed under medical observation continued to rise.  One of 195 US citizens evacuated from Wuhan, China, and voluntarily confined to a military base near Los Angeles for evaluation was slapped with a mandatory quarantine after trying to leave the facility, health officials there said on Thursday. The quarantine order, issued Wednesday night by the county health agency, requires the individual to remain at March Air Reserve Base for the full 14-day incubation period of the virus, rather than 72 hours as prescribed by the CDC to screen evacuees before they are released. None has shown any symptoms, a county health spokeswoman said. The quarantined person, whose identity was not disclosed, is complying with the order, she added. The first five known US patients are believed to have contracted the virus during visits to China, epicentre of the worldwide outbreak, whereas the newly diagnosed Illinois patient - confirmed by the CDC on Wednesday - was infected by his wife. ""This is the first case of person-to-person transmission in the US,"" said Dr Allison Arwady, a commissioner at the Chicago Department of Public Health. Even so, Arwady added, ""there is no local emergency"". The United States told its citizens Thursday night ""do not travel"" to China, raising its warning alert to the highest level because of the coronavirus epidemic. In issuing a level four travel advisory - up from urging Americans to ""reconsider"" travel to China - the State Department said it was acting after the World Health Organization declared the epidemic originating in the city of Wuhan an international emergency. In an updated travel advisory, the department said any Americans in China now ""should consider departing using commercial means."". It recalled that last week it had ordered the departure of all non-emergency US personnel and their family members from Wuhan. ""The US government has limited ability to provide emergency services to US citizens in Hubei province,"" the advisory said.   Concern about the new virus has mushroomed around the world as more cases turn up outside China. Health authorities still do not know how dangerous the virus is or how easily it spreads. The World Health Organization on Thursday declared the coronavirus outbreak in China a global emergency as cases spread to 18 countries. More than 200 deaths and nearly 10,000 cases have been reported in China, the vast majority in and around Wuhan, China, where it is believed to have originated in a market that traded in illegal wildlife. US RISK STILL SEEN AS LOW Airlines were facing mounting pressure by cabin crew to stop all flights due to unease about exposure to the rapidly spreading coronavirus, with American Airlines' pilots filing a lawsuit seeking an immediate halt. The Illinois Department of Public Health said it was tracking 21 people who had contact with the infected Illinois couple, both in their 60s. Officials said the husband had not recently taken public transportation or attended any large gatherings. He has been in isolation the past two days after showing symptoms and was immediately hospitalised, Arwady said. CDC experts said they were not surprised by the development and that further person-to-person cases were likely to emerge. ""We understand that this may be concerning, but based on what we know now, we still believe the immediate risk to the American public is low,” CDC director Dr Robert Redfield said in a release on Thursday. Following the airlift of State Department employees and other Americans from Wuhan, Washington also was evacuating non-emergency government employees and family members from the US Embassy in Beijing and consulates in Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenyang due to the coronavirus outbreak, a State Department official said on Thursday. The department also will charter additional evacuation flights from Wuhan, leaving on Monday or sooner, it said in a statement on its website.

04 Feb 2020 06:30AM,Commentary: Novel coronavirus reveals old vulnerabilities in the global economy,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners The novel coronavirus has the potential to become a big enough shock that reveals the weaknesses of central banks and sluggish global growth, says Mohamed El-Erian. NEWPORT BEACH, California: Last week’s fretting over the coronavirus was a good illustration of a tug of war that has been playing out in financial markets for a while: Between favourable sentiment and mounting longer-term economic uncertainties. Until now, at least, that contest has been resolved in favour of ever-higher stock prices. But investors need to decide if they want to opt for more of the same, by continuing to implement an investment playbook that has served them well, or if they want to treat the viral outbreak for what it is — a big economic shock that could derail global growth and shake markets out of their “buy-the-dip” conditioning. Entering 2020, investors faced the challenge of balancing favourable short-term market technicals with weaker fundamentals, and doing so with government bonds providing little protection given the very low — and, in some cases, negative — level of yields in advanced countries. NOVEL VULNERABILITIES The coronavirus outbreak amplifies two vulnerabilities: Structurally weak global growth and less effective central banks. It is becoming harder for markets to treat such fragilities as being beyond the immediate horizon, especially with a host of other uncertainties not far behind, including the recurrence of trade tensions, growing realisation of the impact of climate change, technological shocks, political polarisation and changing demographics. Retail, trade and travel are simple ways to illustrate what is going on in China. Stores are facing dramatic disruptions involving a virtual halt in traffic, while suppliers are finding it harder and slower to move their merchandise, both within and in and out of the country. And there is a huge drop in travel to China, dealing another blow to economic activities undermined by less internal mobility. This virtual stoppage of economic activities is cascading throughout the second-largest economy in the world, and one with considerable regional and global ties. It is fundamentally weakening the country’s services sector, at a time of considerable challenges for manufacturing. CHINA SLOWDOWN With both engines of growth now sputtering, internal and external, China will also find it harder to navigate its transition from a middle-income economy. The country’s increasing “sudden stop” economic dynamics also involve adverse spill-over effects, first and foremost for emerging Asian economies with strong economic and financial linkages with China.   A weakening China is also a problem for Europe, where the European Central Bank is effectively out of productive ammunition and politicians are yet to implement a comprehensive pro-growth policy package. And with the virus affecting the movement of people and goods, there is an increased risk of a multi-year process of de-globalisation that neither the global economy nor markets are wired for. The coronavirus also has the potential to constitute a structural break for markets: A big enough shock that fundamentally shifts sentiment. NEW GAME PLAN Previously, markets had been underpinned by the belief that central banks were always willing and able to repress volatility and boost asset prices. That fuelled investors’ fear of missing out on a seemingly never-ending rally. Until last Friday (Jan 31) when US stocks dropped about 2 per cent, markets’ inclination was to respond to sell-offs by deploying a game plan that worked well in 2019 and early 2020, including in response to shocks such as the US missile attack that killed a top Iranian general and the disruption to half of Saudi Arabia’s oil production.   For the previous year, traders and investors quickly bought every dip in the belief that the latest shock would prove temporary, contained and reversible. Now, the multi-year gap between elevated asset prices and weaker economic conditions is becoming increasingly unsustainable. The global economy and markets are getting closer to the neck of a T-junction. What comes after that involves a stark contrast, depending on how policymakers respond. One way involves recession, financial instability and even more complicated politics; the other, a genuine growth process that validates elevated asset prices in an orderly fashion and opens the way for more constructive politics. If investors still insist on immediately buying dips, they should do so in a much more differentiated manner by favouring higher-quality issuers that are underpinned by strong balance sheets. They should also avoid swapping US assets for more international exposure, which — although more attractively valued — is much less resilient to global economic weakness. For the remainder, which is probably most investors, they should consider that this latest shock to fundamentals could prove severe enough to dislodge for a while the bullish market conditioning that has been so critical to this historic stock rally. Given that the negative economic effects of the virus are yet to be sufficiently absorbed by markets, this also calls for much greater immediate attention to potential vulnerabilities in portfolios, in the form of equity and liquidity risk.

14 Feb 2020 08:20AM,"China reports 121 new coronavirus deaths, more than 5,000 new cases","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The death toll from a coronavirus outbreak rose by 121 in mainland China, the national health commission said on Friday (Feb 14). The majority of the deaths came from the central province of Hubei and its capital Wuhan, where the flu-like virus named COVID-19 is believed to have originated late last year. Hubei's health commission said there were 116 new deaths in the province, including 88 in Wuhan. A further 5,090 cases had been detected, including 4,823 in Hubei. More than four-fifths of the province's new cases were in Wuhan. The accumulative death toll was, however, revised downwards from 1,488 to 1,380, after officials said some fatalities had been counted more than once. The National Health Commission removed 108 deaths after discovering ""duplicate statistics"" in Hubei, according to its daily update, without providing more details.  The commission also subtracted 1,043 from the total number of confirmed infections in Hubei after a ""verification"". The total number of cases now stands at 63,851. The extent of the epidemic seemed to deepen on Thursday after authorities in Hubei started counting patients who were diagnosed through lung imaging, in addition to those who undergo lab tests. The revision added nearly 15,000 patients to Hubei's count in a single day, with officials explaining that past cases were included. The World Health Organization has moved to calm fears, saying the new numbers did ""not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the outbreak"". But Adam Kamradt-Scott, an infectious diseases expert at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney, said the new figures give no indication the outbreak is nearing a peak. ""Based on the current trend in confirmed cases, this appears to be a clear indication that while the Chinese authorities are doing their best to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the fairly drastic measures they have implemented to date would appear to have been too little, too late,"" he said. BACKLASH AGAINST BUREAUCRATS The epidemic has given China's ruling Communist Party one of its sternest challenges in years, constrained the world's second-largest economy and triggered a purge of provincial bureaucrats. Provincial Communist Party boss Jiang Chaoliang was fired as secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee, and Ma Guoqiang removed as party chief in Wuhan, state media said. They were the two highest-profile officials to be axed since the outbreak. Economists are assessing the impact of the outbreak on the world's second-largest economy and scaling back their expectations for growth this year. China's economy will grow at its slowest rate since the global financial crisis in the current quarter, according to a Reuters poll of economists who said the downturn will be short-lived if the outbreak is contained.

08 Feb 2020 01:28AM,Outrage grows over death of Chinese doctor who sounded coronavirus alarm,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING/SHANGHAI: A Chinese doctor reprimanded for warning of a ""SARS-like"" coronavirus before it was officially recognised died of the illness on Friday, triggering anger at the government. The death of Li Wenliang, 34, came as President Xi Jinping reassured the United States and the World Health Organization (WHO) of transparency and maximum effort to combat the virus. Beijing's communist leadership has sealed off cities, cancelled flights and closed factories to limit an epidemic roiling the world's second biggest economy to the alarm of global markets and businesses dependent on Chinese supply lines. The epicentre region of Hubei is in lockdown and the capital Beijing resembles a ghost town. Deaths in mainland China reached 637 on Friday, with a total of 31,211 cases, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva, warning of a worldwide shortage of gowns, masks and other protective equipment. ""For the last two days there had been fewer reported infections in China, which is good news, but we caution against reading too much into that,"" he told the WHO Executive Board. ""The numbers could go up again."" Virus concerns swiped world markets on Friday, but failed to stand in the way of the best week for stocks since June and the strongest for the dollar since August. With Chinese buyers rejecting shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) due to the epidemic, traders rushed to find alternative locations amid record low prices. US President Donald Trump, after speaking to Xi by phone, said China was showing ""great discipline"". ""Nothing is easy, but he will be successful, especially as the weather starts to warm & the virus hopefully becomes weaker, and then gone,"" Trump said on Twitter.   OPTHALMOLOGIST REBUKED Ophthalmologist Li was among eight people reprimanded by police in the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, for spreading ""illegal and false"" information. His social media warnings of a new ""SARS-like"" coronavirus - a reference to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which killed almost 800 people around the world in 2002-2003 after originating in China - angered police. China was accused of trying to cover up SARS. Li was made to sign a letter on Jan 3, saying he had ""severely disrupted social order"" and was threatened with charges. Social media users called him a hero and shared a selfie of him lying on a hospital bed wearing an oxygen respirator and holding up his Chinese identification card. One image showed the message ""farewell Li Wenliang"" etched into snow on a riverbank. ""Wuhan indeed owes Li Wenliang an apology,"" said Hu Xijin, editor of the government-backed Global Times tabloid. Rights group Amnesty International called his death a ""tragic reminder"" of how China's preoccupation with stability made it suppress vital information. There were signs discussion of his death was being censored. After briefly trending on Weibo, the topics ""the Wuhan government owes doctor Li Wenliang an apology"" and ""we want free speech"" yielded no search results.   ""UNACCEPTABLE STIGMA"" The virus has spread around the world, with 320 cases now in 27 countries and regions outside mainland China, a Reuters tally of official statements shows. WHO emergency expert Mike Ryan called out stigma being attached to the virus amid reports of Asians being shunned in the West. ""The unnecessary, unhelpful profiling of individuals based on ethnicity is utterly and completely unacceptable and it needs to stop,"" he said. The outbreak could have spread from bats to humans via illegal traffic of pangolins, the world's only scaly mammals, Chinese researchers said, sparking some scepticism. Two deaths have been reported outside mainland China, in Hong Kong and the Philippines, but how deadly and contagious the virus is remains unclear, prompting countries to quarantine hundreds of people and cut travel links with China. There were 41 new cases among about 3,700 people quarantined in a cruise ship off Japan, taking the total to 61. Chinese-ruled Hong Kong quarantined for a third day a cruise ship with 3,600 on board. And about two dozen sick passengers aboard a cruise ship that arrived off New Jersey in the United States were screened for the coronavirus, with four sent to a local hospital out of ""an abundance of caution,"" the local mayor said. The head of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice, Li Fuying, told reporters that people deliberately concealing contacts or refusing isolation could be punished with death.

14 Feb 2020 06:03PM,Philippines lifts Taiwan travel ban imposed over coronavirus,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners MANILA: The Philippines has lifted a travel ban that was imposed on visitors from Taiwan in a bid to control the spread of the coronavirus, and will evaluate other restrictions including those on Macau, government officials said on Friday (Feb 14). The decision followed a warning by Taiwan, which has only reported 18 cases of the virus compared to more than 63,000 in China, of possible retaliation against the ban. Taiwan had complained the ban was due to the World Health Organization. The WHO considers self-ruled Taiwan a part of China, listing the island under China for virus case numbers, which Taiwan said gave a misleading impression that it had the same rampant outbreak of the disease as China. Curbs imposed on Taiwan were removed effective immediately, and its people are again free to travel to and from the Philippines, Salvador Panelo, spokesman for President Rodrigo Duterte, said in a statement. ""The lifting of travel restrictions for Taiwan has been agreed by the members of the Inter-Agency Task Force by reason of the strict measures (against the virus) they are undertaking,"" Panelo said. The decision was first confirmed to Reuters by a senior government official, who asked not to be identified prior to the signing of the order. Safeguards will be put in place, including ""heightened standard precautionary measures"" and port-of-exit screening, the official said. The Philippines health and tourism ministers confirmed the order's signing and said safety protocols would be implemented. Taiwan's Foreign Ministry welcomed the news, saying the island had the virus situation well in hand. The WHO needs to recognise that Taiwan does not come under China's remit, and make amends, it added. The ministry said the WHO's mistaken designation of Taiwan and listing it as part of China's virus area had ""misled"" the international community, causing huge problems for Taiwan's government and people. Taiwan and the Philippines have close economic ties and there are more than 115,000 Filipinos living and working in Taiwan, mainly in factories and as household helpers. Taiwan is the Philippines' fifth-largest tourist market, with 327,273 arrivals in January to November last year, up 35 per cent versus the same period in 2018, tourism ministry data showed. The coronavirus has killed more than 1,380 people, almost all in China where the outbreak originated, with one each in Hong Kong the Philippines and Japan. The Philippines, which recorded the first fatality from the epidemic outside of China, imposed the travel ban on travellers from Taiwan on Monday. Taiwan appealed for its lifting. Panelo said an inter-agency panel will evaluate other jurisdictions, including the Chinese territory of Macau, for release from the ban as well, Panelo said.

With only 162 days to go until the opening ceremony, concerns have been raised about Japan's hosting of the Games with the virus spreading throughout Asia. But Tokyo 2020 CEO Yoshiro Mori slapped down such concerns at a meeting with top International Olympic Committee officials. ""With regards to the coronavirus ... there are many irresponsible rumours but I would like to make it clear again that we are not considering postponing or cancelling the Games,"" he said. ""We would like to coordinate with the national government and act in a calm manner,"" he stressed. The virus has already forced the rescheduling of a swathe of sporting events in Asia, including Olympic qualification competitions for boxing and basketball - both in China. Formula One's Shanghai Grand Prix has been postponed from mid-April, with the inaugural Vietnamese Grand Prix also under threat as well as the Hong Kong Sevens. Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike has promised to implement ""thorough measures"" to protect people from the coronavirus in the run-up to the Olympics. Japan has not seen any deaths from COVID-19 but has 28 cases on its soil, with four in serious condition in hospital. Another 174 people, including a quarantine officer, have been infected on a cruise ship floating off the Japanese coast - the outbreak's largest single cluster. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government has come under fire for its handling of the infection, especially quarantine measures seen as too lax in the early stages of the epidemic. ""These struggles in turn have sparked concerns about the forthcoming Tokyo Olympics, as Japan prepares for the arrival of millions of international visitors over the summer,"" said Tobias Harris from Teneo Consultancy. The mayor of the Olympic Village, Saburo Kawabuchi, told the meeting there was ""still no clue as to when the virus will be resolved"" and appeared to pin hopes on increased humidity to kill off the disease. ""We have the rainy season that could defeat the virus,"" he said. In China on Thursday, hard-hit Hubei province where the virus emerged announced 242 more deaths and nearly 15,000 extra patients as authorities changed their threshold for diagnosis. At least 1,355 people have now died nationwide and nearly 60,000 have been infected after Hubei's health commission reported the new numbers.

04 Feb 2020 06:00PM,What we know about the locally transmitted coronavirus cases in Singapore,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Six patients in Singapore, including four with no recent travel history to China, have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced on Tuesday (Feb 4). The four cases of local transmission are linked to travellers from China, the ministry said. Another two cases are Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30. This brings the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 24. Of the four locally transmitted cases, three had ""prolonged interactions"" with recent travellers from China. Two of the Chinese travellers have since been confirmed to have been infected with the coronavirus, according to health authorities in China. ""Though four of these cases constitute a local transmission cluster, there is as yet no evidence of widespread sustained community transmission in Singapore,"" MOH said. Here is what we know about the six new cases: A tour group from China had arrived in Singapore on Jan 22. A day later, the group visited a health product shop at 24 Cavan Road in Jalan Besar, among other places. CASE 19 Case 19 is a 28-year-old Singapore permanent resident who works as a salesperson at Yong Thai Hang, a complementary health product shop that primarily serves Chinese tourists. She has no recent travel history to China. She reported having a sore throat and fever on Jan 29 and sought treatment at a GP clinic on the same day, MOH said.     She went to Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s (TTSH) emergency department on Jan 30 and was discharged after a chest X-ray came back negative for pneumonia. She did not leave her home at Jalan Bukit Merah from Jan 31 to Feb 2. On Feb 3, she was admitted to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and tested positive for the novel coronavirus past 11pm on the same day. MOH's director of services Associate Professor Kenneth Mak told reporters that the patient had not met the ""case definition"" on Jan 30 because she did not have pneumonia when she was checked at TTSH and had no recent travel history to China. The situation changed on Feb 3 when she went to SGH, where she was diagnosed with pneumonia, Assoc Prof Mak said.  In an update on Feb 5 and Feb 6, MOH announced that her husband and 6-month-old baby was also infected. Their maid (case 21) had also been infected. CASE 20 Case 20 is a 48-year-old Singaporean woman who also works as a salesperson at Yong Thai Hang. She has no recent travel history to China. The woman, who stays at Hougang Street 61, reported onset of symptoms on Jan 25 and was admitted to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 3. Details of her movements between those dates were not provided. ""Given that she is a colleague of case 19, she was classified as a suspect case and immediately isolated,"" MOH said in a press release. Test results confirmed the infection on Tuesday morning. CASE 21 Case 21 is case 19’s domestic helper. The 44-year-old Indonesian national has no recent travel history to China and resided at Jalan Bukit Merah as well. She reported onset of symptoms on Feb 2 and did not leave her place of residence. She was also admitted to SGH on Feb 3. She was tested positive for the novel coronavirus on Tuesday afternoon.   CASE 24 Case 24 is a 32-year-old Singaporean woman who works as a tour guide and brings groups of tourists to Yong Thai Hang, where cases 19 and 20 are employees. She had no recent travel history to China. She had no symptoms when she went to NCID on Feb 3, where she was immediately isolated. Test results confirmed the infection on Tuesday afternoon. ""We are also contacting individuals with profiles similar to the above four cases of local transmission, who had recent close contact with individuals with travel history to mainland China,"" said MOH.  In an update on Feb 6, MOH said that the woman's husband was tested positive for the virus. Before being isolated at NCID on Feb 4, he stayed at his home at Jalan Bukit Merah and worked as a private hire driver. He indicated that he had visited Tiong Bahru Plaza, Tiong Bahru Market and Beo Crescent Market and Food Centre. The risk of infection from transient contact, such as on public transport or in public places, is assessed to be low, MOH has said. CASES 22 AND 23 Cases 22 and 23 were among the 92 Singaporeans evacuated on Jan 30 from Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. They did not have any symptoms when they boarded the Scoot flight and they were put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore. All Singaporeans who were evacuated from Wuhan were tested for the novel coronavirus. On Monday, cases 22 and 23 tested positive, despite continuing to show no symptoms. They are warded in isolation rooms at NCID.   On Jan 31, it was announced that all new visitors with recent travel history to mainland China will not be allowed to enter Singapore. These visitors will also not be allowed to transit in Singapore. Those with Chinese passports, with the exception of Singapore permanent residents (PRs) and long-term pass holders, will also not be allowed to enter Singapore.  The coronavirus has killed more than 400 people and infected more than 20,000 around the world. The World Health Organization has declared the virus outbreak a global emergency.

09 Feb 2020 11:32AM,MAS reminds of vigilance against cyber threats taking advantage of coronavirus situation,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) reminded financial institutions to remain vigilant on the cybersecurity front amid cases of ""cyber threat actors"" taking advantage of the coronavirus situation to conduct email scams, phishing and ransomware attacks. In a media release on Sunday (Feb 9), MAS said it issued the advisory - its third since January -to financial institutions on Friday, after Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) alert level to Orange. The authority also advised financial institutions to adopt the additional measures recommended by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Manpower. The measures include cancelling non-essential large-scale events and allowing telecommuting or dividing the workplace into segregated teams. MAS said financial institutions should ensure the following while carrying out such business continuity plans: The authority also said it has been informed of scammers impersonating MOH contact tracing officials and requesting financial information from individuals. ""MOH does not ask for financial information during contact tracing calls,"" said MAS. Members of the public are advised to verify the authenticity of the phone calls with the MOH hotline (6325 9220) if they have doubts about the caller's identity, said MAS. The authority said it is ""closely monitoring"" the coronavirus situation and ""remains engaged with financial institutions to ensure that appropriate business continuity plans are in place"".

01 Feb 2020 08:47PM,"Singapore confident that China, other countries will work together to win battle against Wuhan coronavirus: PM Lee","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore has confidence that China and other countries will work together to win the battle against the Wuhan coronavirus, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Saturday (Feb 1). Speaking at a Chinese New Year Celebration in Teck Ghee, Mr Lee said that everyone is concerned about the coronavirus as some may recall when the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) hit Singapore in 2003. “We did not know how long it would last, and we worried about our loved ones being infected. But we stayed united and dealt with the crisis together."" Since then, Mr Lee said that Singapore has become better prepared with medical facilities like the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and healthcare professionals who are trained to deal with this scenario. “So I have every confidence that we can overcome the challenge before us,” he said. Referring to Singapore’s decision to restrict entry to new visitors of any nationality with recent travel history to mainland China, Mr Lee said it was a pre-emptive measure taken purely to protect Singapore’s public health.  He added that China is doing all it can to contain the coronavirus spread, including imposing their own travel restrictions within China, cancelling outbound tour groups and bringing back Hubei residents from overseas. “It is a much stronger response than they took when SARS first broke out, so our efforts ... will complement China’s efforts,"" he said. ""We wish China well in their efforts to fight the virus,” Mr Lee added. Regrettably, sentiment against those from the People’s Republic of China has emerged in the last few days in many countries, said Mr Lee, adding that such sentiments are “not helpful at all”.  “The virus may have started in China but it doesn’t respect nationality or race. It doesn't check your passport before it goes into your body and anybody can be infected."" Mr Lee stressed that the coronavirus situation should be seen as a public health issue and not as a race or international diplomatic problem. Mr Lee noted that while the situation with the new coronavirus bears some similarities to SARS, it also is somewhat different. The new virus seems to be less lethal than SARS but is also more infectious. Patient may also be asymptomatic when they are infectious, which makes detection difficult. Hence, Mr Lee said that Singapore has to work harder to isolate suspect cases as soon as they are identified, and contain the virus from spreading in the community.  Another difference from SARS is that Singapore did not have social media back then. In a crisis, Mr Lee said social media has been both a boon and a bane as there is now a lot more information circulating online, on WhatsApp and on Facebook, including misleading rumours and false information. Mr Lee said some of these go viral because people are anxious and want to share information without verifying it. Such rumours can easily amplify anxieties and make it harder for people to get the correct information they need, and can even spark fear and panic, he added. “So I strongly advise everybody, if you hear something shocking ... check with proper channels, check from trusted places.” Members of the public can also subscribe to the Government WhatsApp channel to get the latest updates. Mr Lee said everyone can also play their part to be responsible for their own and their families’ safety by practising good personal hygiene and washing their hands frequently.  Those who have a fever, or show symptoms of a cold, should put on a mask and see the doctor. “We know that some of you are worried as you could not buy your own masks."" For those who need them, Mr Lee said each household can collect a pack of four masks from their neighbourhood RCs, in stages starting from Saturday. Mr Lee ended his speech by calling on Singapore to remain resilient and calm, respond to the situation as one united nation, and “show care and concern for our fellow human beings”. He added that everyone should continue with their lives as much as possible and that he has confidence Singapore will get through this situation together as it is well-prepared and has dealt with worse situations before.

08 Feb 2020 12:36AM,Lockheed Martin pulls out of Singapore Airshow over coronavirus concerns,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners WASHINGTON: US weapons maker Lockheed Martin said on Friday (Feb 7) it will not participate in next week's Singapore Airshow over coronavirus concerns. ""Following the Singapore Ministry of Health's Feb 7 declaration of a Code Orange health alert, we consulted with the US government and our medical teams and decided not to participate in the Singapore Airshow,"" the company said in a statement. ""We determined this was in the best interest of our employees and aligned with the US Department of Defense's decision to reduce its presence,"" it said. Earlier on Friday, people familiar with the matter said the Pentagon will reduce the size of its delegation travelling to the airshow. Ellen Lord, the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer, will no longer attend the event as the lead Pentagon representative, the people said. Other Pentagon leaders including uniformed military officials still plan to attend. The airshow will continue next week, but organisers might look to limit public visitors, Singapore said on Friday, as the country reported three more coronavirus cases that authorities have not yet linked to previous infections or travel to China. The new cases take Singapore's virus tally to 33 with the alert level raised to Orange, denoting the disease is severe and passes easily from person-to-person. Red - the highest alert level - indicates it is spreading widely. The trade portion of the airshow, held every two years, is set to begin on Feb 11. Two other aviation manufacturers, DeHavilland Canada and Viking Air, on Friday also pulled out of the airshow, citing the increased alert level. Their parent company Longview Aviation said the decision was made ""out of an abundance of caution for the well-being of our employees"". Business jet manufacturers Bombardier, Textronand General Dynamics's Gulfstream division are among other companies that have withdrawn from the airshow.

10 Feb 2020 07:51PM,"China says 27 foreigners in the country have been infected with coronavirus, 2 dead","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: China's Foreign Ministry said that 27 foreigners in the country have been infected with the coronavirus as of Monday morning (Feb 10), and two had died. An American died on Feb 6 and a Japanese died on Feb 8, ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing in Beijing. Three of the cases have been discharged, he added. Both the American and the Japanese man died in Wuhan. Medical staff did their utmost to treat the two and Chinese officials have been in touch with their respective families, Xinhua reported Geng as saying. China offers its deepest condolences over the deaths, the spokesperson said, adding that the country places great importance on the health and safety of all foreign nationals in Wuhan. ""The Chinese side will offer necessary assistance to the US side and the Japanese side, as well as the bereaved families,"" Xinhua reported Geng as saying. The number of deaths from China's new coronavirus surged past 900 in mainland China on Monday after the hardest-hit province of Hubei reported 91 new fatalities. In its daily update, Hubei's health commission also confirmed another 2,618 new cases in the central province, where the outbreak emerged in December. There are now more than 39,800 confirmed cases across China, based on previously released figures from the government. The new virus is believed to have emerged last year in a market that sells wild animals in Hubei's capital Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, before spreading across the country. The latest data came after the WHO said the last four days had seen ""some stabilising"" in Hubei, but warned the figures could still ""shoot up"".

07 Feb 2020 07:42PM,"Hong Kong unveils novel coronavirus quarantine plans, with jail for dodgers","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners HONG KONG: Hong Kong on Friday (Feb 7) said it will deploy an army of volunteers to bolster plans to forcibly quarantine all arrivals from mainland China, warning that anyone caught breaching the new rules faces up to six months' jail. In a major escalation of its battle against the new coronavirus, the international finance hub has said anyone arriving from the mainland from Saturday will have to undergo 14 days compulsory quarantine. Officials hope the new measures will virtually halt all cross-border traffic while allowing the city to remain stocked with food and goods from the mainland where the virus has killed more than 600 people. Cabinet ministers unveiled the quarantine plans just six hours before the new policy was due to come on. Hong Kong residents arriving from mainland China will be allowed to self-quarantine at home. Chinese and international visitors will be able to self-quarantine at hotels or any other accommodation they have arranged. ""If they cannot arrange accommodation, they will be taken to the temporary facilities prepared by the government,"" health secretary Sophia Chan said. Anyone who has been to mainland China in the past 14 days and then flies into Hong Kong from another destination will also be quarantined. Officials - backed by volunteers from the civil service and some students - will conduct spot checks or make daily phone calls to ensure people were staying at home. Those caught breaking their quarantine face up to six months in jail and a HK$25,000 (US$3,200) fine. ""We will be stopping a lot of people with the new measures,"" Security Minister John Lee said. PANIC BUYING The new regulations have been enacted under a sweeping emergency law that allows city leaders to bypass the legislature during a disease outbreak. Exemptions would be made for a variety of key jobs, including flight and shipping crews as well as cross border truck drivers to ensure goods and food keep coming into the city. Hong Kong has been hit by a wave of panic-buying in recent days with supermarket shelves frequently emptied of crucial goods such as toilet paper, hand sanitiser, rice and pasta. The government has blamed false online rumours of shortages, saying supplies are stable. ""The problem of supply shortage doesn't exist,"" said Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung. ""Citizens do not need to worry or make excessive purchases out of panic. I urge the public not to believe in rumours."" The new coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan at the end of last year has killed more than 630 people and spread around the world. The latest figures from China show there are more than 30,000 people infected there. Outside mainland China, there have been more than 320 infections reported in two dozen countries. Hong Kong has 25 confirmed cases with one patient who died earlier this week. Many of the newer infections have no history of travel to mainland China, prompting fears that the city now has a local self-sustaining outbreak. There have been growing calls for the border with China to be sealed entirely. Hong Kong's pro-Beijing leadership, which currently has record low approval ratings after months of protests, had been reluctant to make such a move. Thousands of medical workers, including some doctors and nurses, have been on strike this week in a bid to force the government to entirely seal the border. On Friday, hundreds of union members occupied the offices of the Hospital Authority. Late Friday the union called off its strike.

03 Feb 2020 06:21AM,Commentary: Tourism in Asia takes a beating after Wuhan coronavirus outbreak,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners The timing could not be worse. The coronavirus outbreak occurring during the Chinese Lunar New Year, one of the biggest travel seasons in Asia, says Lisa Wan. HONG KONG: The novel coronavirus outbreak has killed hundreds and infected more than 14,000 in China within the last two months. At least 15 cities in China are locked down, accounting for a population of over 50 million people. Given the virus continues to spread worldwide, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on Friday (Jan 31). More countries, including the US, UK, and Canada, have warned against nonessential travel to China as well as established travel restrictions to tourists Among many, Singapore has also blocked the entry of tourists who had visited Hubei province in the past 14 days, or who hold passports issued in the province, and just these past few days, widened these restrictions to all visitors with recent travel history to China. Malaysia has also stopped issuing visas to Chinese travellers from Hubei. KEY TOURISM MARKETS AFFECTED The tourism industry – which include hotels, airlines, casinos and restaurants - is expected to suffer massively during the outbreak. For example, officials in Thailand estimate potential lost revenue at 50 billion baht (US$1.6 billion) around Lunar New Year this year.   The timing could not be worse. The coronavirus outbreak occurring during the Chinese Lunar New Year, one of the biggest travel seasons in Asia, when hundreds of millions of Chinese return to homes or take holidays, both domestically and internationally. The tourism industries in China and key countries that rely on Chinese tourists will suffer the most immediate repercussions. According to the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute, 6.3 million Chinese tourists travel abroad during the 2019 Lunar New Year holiday, generating travel revenue of around 513.9 billion yuan (US$73 billion). Before the outbreak, the Institute predicted 7 million Chinese tourists would travel abroad during the Lunar New Year this year. Hong Kong, Thailand and Japan are top favourite travel destinations. Chinese visitors make up the largest source market of Hong Kong, accounting for around 78 per cent (around 44 million) of the total number of visitor arrivals in Hong Kong for the entire 2019 (of 56 million). On the one hand, Hong Kong’s appeal to Chinese tourists has already been weakened by months of political protests, with inbound tourism already down 56 per cent from a year earlier. But with the coronavirus outbreak, Hong Kong has now suspended flights and train services to Wuhan and cancelled all Lunar New Year celebrations. The Hong Kong Marathon, originally scheduled for early February, had also been called off. Hong Kong airlines are cutting the number of their flights to the mainland by about half through the end of March in response to government virus-control efforts. All these additional virus-control policies will hit the Hong Kong tourism industry harder. The number of Chinese visitors to Japan has also exploded from around 450,000 in 2003 to 8.4 million in 2018, accounting for 27 per cent of all inbound tourists. Chinese tourists are also big spenders in many other cities, like London, Paris and New York. For example, China remains the fifth-largest source of foreign tourism to the US, behind Canada, Mexico, the UK and Japan. Around 3 million Chinese tourists also travelled to the US in 2018, spending more than US$36 billion.   The novel coronavirus has now infected more people in China than the SARS outbreak in 2003. The number of confirmed cases has jumped to more than 14,000, surpassing the 5,329 in China from SARS. According to the International Monetary Fund, China accounted for 4.3 per cent of world economic output in 2003, and this number jumped to 16.3 per cent last year. In other words, the novel coronavirus will affect the world economy more significantly when compared to the SARS outbreak. PRUDENT STRATEGY TO SCREEN ALL TRAVELLERS MORE THOROUGHLY That the novel coronavirus happened during the midst of the Chinese Lunar New Year period shows why tourism is one way in which the virus spread rather quickly. Aside from the imposition of travel restrictions on travellers from Hubei or China more largely, countries must screen all travellers from other countries just as thoroughly. The new coronavirus is able to transfer from one person to another, so crowded tourist attractions and closed spaces in planes definitely will speed up its spread. All but one reported death from the outbreak have so far occurred in China, but travellers have spread the virus to numerous other places. Cases have been confirmed in numerous countries including Australia, Cambodia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, the UK, the US and Vietnam.   One typical example is the first case of virus in Japan. The infected Japanese driver drove tour buses for Chinese groups from Wuhan in January, ferrying them from Osaka to Tokyo and back. He is believed to be the first case of the virus in Japan not linked to recent travel to China but was likely to have contracted the infection through while in confined spaces in the tour bus. A scientific paper published on Jan 14 in the Journal of Travel Medicine examined the potential for the international spread of the Wuhan coronavirus via commercial air travel. It identified the top 20 destination cities with regard to passengers arriving from Wuhan, using International Air Transport Association data from January to March 2018. Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei welcomed the most arrivals at 41,080, 23,707, 20,001, and 17,645 respectively. All have identified cases of the coronavirus, although several of Hong Kong’s cases are known to have entered the city via the high-speed railway rather than on a plane.

02 Feb 2020 06:05PM,Singapore focused on minimising risk of community spread of Wuhan coronavirus: Iswaran,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore remains focused on ""minimising"" the risk of a community spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, said Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran on Sunday (Feb 2). Several measures were announced over the past week, including widening travel restrictions for new visitors who have recent travel history to mainland China. These measures are ""in the best interests of our community and society"", Mr Iswaran said. ""So our focus is to ensure, to the best of our ability, that the risk of a community spread in Singapore is minimised,"" he added. ""That is where our focus should be, resolutely."" Mr Iswaran was responding to a question about the first death from the coronavirus outside China. Earlier Sunday, the Philippines reported that a 44-year-old man from Wuhan had died in a hospital in Manila after being tested positive for the coronavirus.   As of Sunday, there are more than 14,000 confirmed cases worldwide. More than 300 people have died after contracting the virus. The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Saturday confirmed two additional imported cases of the Wuhan coronavirus on Saturday, bringing the total number of cases here to 18. There is no evidence of community spread in Singapore, MOH said. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a Chinese New Year event by the West Coast Vista Residents' Committee, Mr Iswaran urged Singaporeans to remain calm. ""We are also counting on Singaporeans to cooperate with us, stay calm, get their information from the right sources, heed the advice that is being given, and to carry on with life as per normal to the best of our abilities,"" he said. ""If we come together, we will pull through this,"" the minister added.   Mr Iswaran - who is a Member of Parliament for West Coast GRC - said while there is a ""clear healthcare challenge"", it was also a ""psychological and social challenge"". ""The response that we have seen from Singaporeans reinforces and attests to the character of our society - that we are a cohesive and resilient society,"" he said. He pointed to examples such as soldiers from the Singapore Armed Forces packing masks to be distributed to Singapore households, efforts from grassroots volunteers in reaching out to residents, and the ""disciplined and orderly manner"" in which residents collected their masks. Earlier this week, it was announced that every Singapore household would each receive four surgical masks. Thousands of masks were handed out at Community Centres (CCs) and Residents' Committee centres on Saturday.  Speaking during a visit to a mask collection centre at Blangah Court CC, Minister for Social and Family Development Desmond Lee said authorities had ""multiple layers of defence"" to rise to the public health challenge. ""But it takes the whole of community, the whole of society working close together, building trust with each other, and ensuring that in our society, there is that social compact, that one will take precautions (and) exercise social responsibility,"" he said. About 6 per cent of all households have collected their masks as of Saturday night, the minister added.

Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said the 44 new cases were from another 221 new tests. They raise the number of infections detected on the Diamond Princess to 218, in addition to a quarantine officer who also tested positive for the coronavirus. Kato said authorities now want to move elderly people off the ship if they test negative for the virus, offering to put them in government-designated lodging. ""We wish to start the operation from tomorrow or later,"" Kato told reporters.   Kato added that elderly passengers who have pre-existing conditions or are in windowless rooms would be allowed to leave starting from Friday, rather than the originally targeted date of Feb 19, and complete their quarantine ashore. About 80 per cent of the ship passengers were aged 60 or over, with 215 in their 80s and 11 in their 90s, according to Japanese media. ""We will make every effort to ensure the safety and peace of mind of the people,"" Kato told a televised news conference, without confirming the number of passengers who may leave ahead of schedule. Those who had been in close contact with persons who tested positive would not be allowed to leave the ship, he said. The Diamond Princess has been moored off Japan since Feb 3, after it emerged that a former passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong last month had tested positive for the virus now named COVID-19. Of the newly diagnosed infections, 43 are passengers, and one a member of the crew. The ship was placed into quarantine shortly afterwards and authorities have asked passengers and crew to remain on board until Feb 19.   Those who have tested positive for the new virus have been taken off the ship to medical facilities, but questions have been raised about whether the quarantine on the ship is working, with dozens of new cases diagnosed almost daily. Passengers are confined to cabins and required to wear masks and keep their distance from each other when they are allowed out for brief periods on open decks.

11 Feb 2020 05:55AM,"OG cuts shopping hours, Honestbee temporarily closes grocery store over coronavirus fears","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: At least two retailers in Singapore have announced shorter business hours or temporary store closures in light of the novel coronavirus outbreak. This comes after Singapore stepped up its risk assessment of the new flu-like virus last week and amid local transmission of the virus, which started in China and has since killed more than 900 and infected more than 40,000. One of them is department store OG, which adjusted its store operating hours shortly after authorities announced the upgrade in the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Friday (Feb 7). Its three stores, which used to be opened from 11am to 9.30pm daily, will now close at 8.30pm “until further notice”. This is so that employees “can go home earlier ... in this critical period of fighting the coronavirus outbreak”, OG said in response to queries from CNA. In line with the heightened measures, OG said it has begun temperature checks for all employees and visitors to its office. Promoters, delivery personnel and other staff entering its department stores must also use masks at all times. Prior to that, it had taken other measures such as increased disinfection of floors, toilets and frequently touched surfaces like railings, lift buttons and escalator. It also said that only one out of its 26 employees from China had recently travelled back home. This employee is currently on a 14-day leave of absence until Feb 18. On whether crowds have thinned at its department stores, OG’s spokesperson told CNA that it has been monitoring developments since reopening for business on Jan 27 after the Chinese New Year holidays. Before that, even though Singapore confirmed its first infected patient on Jan 23, OG “did not see a distinct drop in customers yet, especially since it was still the pre-Chinese New Year shopping period”. But after the Chinese New Year break and with the DORSCON level at Yellow, the mall “began to see a decline in footfall and business”, with stores becoming “very quiet after 7pm”. In particular, its department store at People’s Park saw the biggest drop in walk-in traffic, the spokesperson told CNA. BHG Holdings also saw a big hit in sales, with transactions across its six outlets dropping between 40 to 50 per cent since the first confirmed case on Jan 23. The chain department store said it will not adjust opening hours at the moment, although it “may review again if the situation changes”. Similarly at Robinsons, operating hours for its three stores remain unchanged for now. Both BHG and Robinsons said they have put in place precautionary measures in line with guidelines from the authorities. Mandatory temperature checks are being carried out, while surgical masks are on hand for employees who feel unwell, they told CNA. They have also stepped up the cleaning of their department stores and commonly-used areas, with Robinsons having a cleaning schedule of sanitising every 2 hours. BHG is also looking to split its front-end staff into two teams so as “to minimise the physical contact (and) lowering the risk of infection”. It added that it also has two employees who are on the 14-day leave of absence, after returning from China on Jan 27 and Feb 4, respectively. Metro and Isetan did not reply by the time this article was published, but a quick check with its customer service centres showed no change in opening hours. HONESTBEE TEMPORARILY CLOSES HABITAT Separately, retail start-up Honestbee has temporarily closed its tech-integrated grocery store Habitat from Monday until Feb 23. The suspension of the grocery store, which is located in Pasir Panjang and also houses a dine-in area, “may be extended if necessary”, according to a company spokesperson.   “We have chosen to temporarily suspend habitat by honestbee as a proactive approach to combat community transmission in light of the increase in novel coronavirus cases and the elevated DORSCON risk assessment status,” she said. Since Singapore confirmed its first case of the coronavirus, footfall in the grocery store has fallen about 60 per cent, with the impact most noticeable during dinner time on weekdays, the spokesperson added. Honestbee has stopped its food delivery and laundry services since May 2019, as it embarks on a court-supervised debt restructuring. It will continue to operate its online grocery delivery service, its announcement on Monday said.

08 Feb 2020 06:57PM,Five Britons in French ski resort catch coronavirus after contact with man who had been in Singapore,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners PARIS: Five British nationals including a child have been diagnosed with the coronavirus in France, after staying in the same ski chalet and coming into contact with a person who had been in Singapore, French health officials said said on Saturday (Feb 8). The new cases emerged after authorities began to retrace the recent travels of one British citizen confirmed by Britain to have contracted the virus in recent days, senior health official Jerome Salomon told a news conference. Agnes Buzyn, France's health minister, added that the group of people newly infected with the virus were not in a serious condition. They had formed ""a cluster, a grouping around one original case"", she said, after staying in the same chalet, in the Contamines-Montjoie resort in Savoie in eastern France. Contamines is in the French Alps, close to the Swiss city of Geneva. ""That original case was brought to our attention last night, it is a British national who had returned from Singapore where he had stayed between Jan 20 and 23, and he arrived in France on Jan 24 for four days,"" Buzyn said. Two of the apartments in the ski chalet were being examined, health officials said, adding that no other people had been affected by the outbreak in the resort. The infected Britons had been hospitalised overnight in the region, in the cities of Lyon, Grenoble and Saint-Etienne, the ministry added. The total number of people infected with the virus in France has now reached 11. The six others include one man in a serious condition, while the others have shown signs of improvement in recent days, according to medical officials. Authorities are now seeking to contact people who came into close contact with the initially infected Briton. The French government has been in touch with Singapore and Britain, and Singaporean authorities were looking into a business meeting that took place in a hotel and was attended by 94 foreigners, they said. On Saturday, Singapore confirmed seven new cases of the novel coronavirus, taking its tally to 40. At least four overseas cases have been linked to an international business conference at Singapore's Grand Hyatt hotel last month. The new coronavirus that emerged in a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of last year has killed 722 people and infected more than 34,546 people in China. Outside China, there have been more than 320 infections reported in nearly 30 other places. There have also been two deaths, one in the Philippines and the other in Hong Kong. Both of those victims were Chinese nationals. On Saturday, it was reported the virus had claimed its first two foreign victims - a US citizen who was diagnosed with the novel coronavirus and a Japanese man suspected to have the infection. Both died in Wuhan.

07 Feb 2020 05:27PM,"Novel coronavirus: 3 new patients in Singapore with no China travel, link to existing cases","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: There are three new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in Singapore and none of them are linked to the existing cases or have been in China recently, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Friday (Feb 7). This brings the number of cases in the country to 33. There are now at least four patients with no recent travel history to China or links to the other cases.  A teacher was among the three new cases announced, while one of the cases went visiting during Chinese New Year after developing symptoms, said MOH. Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that authorities are now expanding their case definition and doing ""proactive case finding"". ""This means never mind a connection to China. When they have pneumonia, I want to know if this is novel coronavirus. We are investigating more cases, so we are discovering more cases,"" said Mr Gan. At a press briefing on Friday, Singapore authorities raised the DORSCON (Disease Outbreak Response System Condition) code to Orange from Yellow.  This means the disease is deemed severe and spreads easily from person to person, but has not spread widely and is being contained. Moderate disruption is expected, due to measures such as quarantine and visitor restrictions at hospitals.  Seventeen of the 33 confirmed patients in Singapore were visitors from China, while another four are Singaporeans who were evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30.   Twelve are locally transmitted, of which nine can be traced back to a group of Chinese tourists from Guangxi. Two patients are now in critical condition, said MOH. They are on breathing support and do not have any other significant medical problems, said MOH director of medical services Kenneth Mak.  Two patients have been discharged, while the remaining cases are stable or improving. The second discharged patient is a woman from Wuhan who was the second confirmed case in Singapore. Mr Mak said that experts around the world are working towards understanding the nature of the new coronavirus and its transmission patterns. ""All of us still recognise that the main form of spread remains by droplets and it is very important for us to recognise that most spread can occur through touch,"" he said.   This means touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the face, mouth or eyes with contaminated hands. He added that there have been some reports of spread from people who have yet to develop symptoms but that the evidence today shows the rate of transmission is ""very low"". THREE NEW CASES On Friday, MOH said that two of the new cases had been to Malaysia prior to their diagnosis. Case 31, a 53-year-old Singaporean man, had been in Malaysia on Jan 6, 11 and 17, said MOH. He reported having symptoms on Jan 23, and visited two clinics before being admitted to Changi General Hospital (CGH) on Feb 1. He is currently warded in an isolation room at CGH. He lives at Tampines Street 24 and had been to the Life Church and Missions Singapore in Paya Lebar. He had visited friends and family during Chinese New Year.   Case 33, a 39-year-old Singaporean woman, had also been in Malaysia from Jan 22 to 29. She is in isolation at Sengkang General Hospital (SKH). She reported having symptoms on Jan 30 and went to the emergency department on SKH on Feb 2 where she was admitted. JUNIOR COLLEGE TEACHER 32ND CASE The 32nd case, a 42-year-old Singaporean woman, reported symptoms on Sunday and was admitted to Parkway East Hospital on Wednesday. She works at Victoria Junior College but did not interact with colleagues or students after onset of symptoms as she was on medical leave.  The last day she was at school was Jan 31, said Ms Liew Wei Li, director of schools at the Ministry of Education (MOE). The teacher stays at Elias Road and had visited Changi Airport and the Singapore Zoo. She is currently warded in an isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). Tests for all three confirmed their 2019-nCOV infections at about 11pm on Thursday. Ms Liew added that a few colleagues and students who have been in close contact with the teacher will be given 14 days of leave of absence since last day of contact with her. The college will be thoroughly disinfecting the staff room, pantry and teaching rooms that the teacher was in and co-curricular activities will be suspended for 14 days, among other measures to prevent large-group gatherings.   UPDATE ON CASE 30 In an update on case 30, which was announced on Thursday, MOH said that the 27-year-old man reported having a fever on Jan 21 and visited a general practitioner clinic on Jan 28. The Singapore citizen, who had attended a conference in Singapore linked to a few other cases, went to another clinic for treatment on Feb 3 before being admitted to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases on Thursday. He lives at Shunfu Road and had been to Far East Square and Junction 8 shopping malls.   The business meeting at the Grand Hyatt was attended by more than 100 people, including participants from the Chinese province of Hubei. The new coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province at the end of last year has killed more than 630 people and spread around the world. The latest figures from China show there are more than 30,000 people infected in the country. A Chinese doctor who was punished after raising the alarm about the virus died from the pathogen on Friday, sparking an outpouring of grief and anger in China over the worsening crisis.

06 Feb 2020 03:57PM,WHO investigates Singapore conference linked to foreign coronavirus spread,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: At least three employees of a multinational company that held a meeting of more than 100 international staff in Singapore have contracted the new coronavirus, sparking a World Health Organization investigation of the case. Malaysia and South Korea have confirmed three cases of the virus related to the mid-January company meeting held with 94 overseas staff at the Grand Hyatt hotel, and Singapore said late on Wednesday (Feb 5) four other attendees were showing symptoms. The sister of a Malaysian who attended has since been infected, while Singapore said virus symptoms had surfaced in four of the firm's local staff. Authorities have not revealed the name of the company, although Korea has said it was an international sales firm. Malaysian health authorities have said people from China including one from the city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged in December, attended. ""WHO is coordinating with relevant ministries of health in relation to it,"" Olivia Lawe-Davies, a spokeswoman for the WHO, said in response to questions from Reuters. ""As countries are stepping up surveillance, the detection of more cases of local transmission can be expected."" Singapore has reported 28 cases of the coronavirus, including some involving person-to-person transmission. The cases linked to the Singapore business meeting provide more evidence the virus is spreading through human-to-human contact outside China, which the WHO has said is deeply concerning and could signal a much larger outbreak. China reported its biggest daily jump in fatalities from the virus on Thursday, up 73 to 563, although there have been only two reported deaths outside mainland China. Malaysian health authorities first revealed the link to the Singapore business meeting when they confirmed the case of a 41-year-old Malaysian who had attended it, along with colleagues from China. South Korea subsequently confirmed two cases involving South Koreans who attended the conference. The Koreans and the Malaysian shared a buffet meal during the conference, South Korean media reported. Of the 15 Singapore attendees, four have been referred to its National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore's health ministry said. All the overseas attendees have left Singapore, the ministry added. A spokesman for the Grand Hyatt, Gerald Kheng, said the hotel had been deep cleaned after it was first informed of the incident by the health ministry on Tuesday and it was not aware of any other cases among guests or staff. In a statement on Thursday, the hotel's general manager Mr Willi Martin said the hotel has engaged a government-appointed external agency to carry out a ""thorough sanitisation"" and deep cleaning of ""potentially impacted guestrooms"". ""The Singapore Ministry of Health is still investigating the cases with the relevant authorities and has not advised details on how, where or when these individuals were infected with the virus,"" he said. Singapore says no evidence has emerged of widespread community spread but it announced new precautionary measures on Tuesday including halting group activities such as school assemblies. Several firms in Singapore have suspended business and media events, including a big travel fair, but the Singapore Airshow is set to go ahead next week albeit on a smaller scale.

05 Feb 2020 12:28PM,"Shortage of face masks in JB amid coronavirus scare, some retailers selling above price ceiling","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners JOHOR BAHRU: Concerns about the novel coronavirus have sparked a shortage of face masks in Johor, with some smaller retailers seen charging above the price ceiling imposed by the government. The authorities, however, said they have found no evidence of profiteering. The southern state has become the frontline of Malaysia’s battle against the virus, with seven out of ten confirmed cases across the country detected in Johor Bahru. Stocks for face masks and hand sanitisers across the city have depleted over the last week. When CNA visited several major pharmacies on Monday (Feb 3), including those in JB Sentral, Jalan Wang Ah Fook and Taman Sri Tebrau, masks were out of stock.   Face masks and hand sanitisers were also sold out at Apex pharmacy at JB City Square as well as Guardian Pharmacy and Caring Pharmacy at JBCC Komtar.   In a Facebook post last Thursday, the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs' (KPDNHEP) branch in Johor state said the government had imposed price ceilings for five different types of face masks.   While the major pharmacies were selling the masks at or below the price ceiling, some of the smaller retailers visited by CNA were selling them at a higher price. At Taman Sri Tebrau, face masks were being sold at a Chinese traditional medicine shop and a grocery store at above the price ceilings. The traditional medicine store was selling three-layer surgical masks at RM9 (US$2.18) per pack. This means that the masks cost RM0.90 each, RM0.10 more than the capped amount. The face masks, which were stored in transparent zip-lock bags, were taken from a room at the back of the shop. The shop owner, who declined to be named, told CNA that he was not aware of any regulation on the price of face masks. Over at the grocery store, each three-layer surgical mask was going for RM1. This was RM0.20 above the price ceiling. The masks were stored in a cardboard box underneath the counter. The owner declined to comment on why he was pricing the masks above the set limit.   Furthermore, a stationery store at Jalan Wang Ah Fook also quoted RM8 for each N95 mask, RM2 above the price cap of RM6. The store was located close to a Big Pharmacy outlet, which had run out of stock for face masks. A staff member from the outlet told CNA that workers from neighbouring stores would snap up face masks in ""large quantities"" before re-selling them for a profit. ""I've seen them buying the masks by the boxes when they realise that the pharmacy's stock has arrived. It's not right but there's not much we can do,"" said the staff member who declined to be named.   Over at Taman Mount Austin, more non-pharmaceutical retailers were also selling face masks for a profit. A florist shop located near a Guardian pharmacy outlet was selling two-layer surgical masks for RM10 per pack of 10. This was a whopping RM0.80 more than the capped amount of RM0.20 per mask. The shop owner said that he did not usually sell face masks but decided to stock up because customers were requesting for them. ""I ordered a shipment from a supplier in Pasir Gudang and the boxes just arrived this week. I think RM10 for 10 face masks is a reasonable price,"" he said. There was also huge disparity in prices at different stores. An electronics store in Taman Mount Austin was selling Arax Japanese Pitta masks at RM3 for a pack of three. However, a provision store nearby was selling the same product for RM15.90, more than five times the amount.   Mr Ivan Yeo, who purchased the masks at the provision store said the authorities should ensure that all face masks are priced fairly and consistently across different retailers. ""We as customers are not sure. It's so difficult to find places that have stock for face masks so we tend to just buy when the stores are selling them,"" said Mr Yeo. NO EVIDENCE OF PROFITEERING: AUTHORITIES When contacted, a spokesperson for Johor KPDNHEP said checks on retailers across Johor Bahru were conducted over the last week following complaints regarding profiteering.   The checks were conducted at shops across Johor Bahru in Bukit Indah, Mount Austin, Setia Eco Park and Taman Daya. The spokesperson noted that although stocks for face masks were depleted at most outlets, there were no evidence of masks being sold at prices above the maximum ceiling. In Malaysia, face masks are regulated under the Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act 2011. Those caught will face a maximum fine of RM100,000 or imprisonment of up to three years, or both. Errant companies could be fined up to RM500,000. CNA has contacted the Johor State Government for comment on further enforcement action on errant retailers, as well as plans on how to ensure there is sufficient stock for face masks for residents in Johor. Meanwhile, pharmacies located near to the causeway said some Singaporeans had been making bulk purchases. Ms Uvarani Kothandan, the manager for Caring Pharmacy’s outlet in JB Sentral, told CNA that the masks at her store were purchased “mostly by Singaporeans” as they were heading towards the immigration clearance at Bandar Sultan Iskandar. “They were mostly families carrying Singapore passports. Many came over during the recent Chinese New Year holidays and bought the mask and sanitisers in bulk,” said Ms Uvarani. Ms Jocelyn Wu, a Singaporean customer at the store who was looking to purchase face masks and hand sanitisers, said buying in Johor Bahru made financial sense as the items were cheaper. Last week, the Singapore government said each Singapore household will receive four surgical masks from the national stockpile. The move to distribute masks came after long queues and empty shelves for face masks were seen at retailers across Singapore. Then, Singapore's Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing had warned against the tendency to panic buy and hoard face masks. ""Such behaviour - they are not appropriate, they are selfish and they are not helpful to our collective defence,"" he said.

02 Feb 2020 11:27AM,Philippines reports first Wuhan coronavirus death outside China,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners MANILA: The Philippines has reported the first death outside China from the coronavirus that has killed more than 300 and spread to other countries, the World Health Organization said on Sunday (Feb 2). The fatality is a Chinese man from the city of Wuhan, where the virus was first detected. ""This is the first reported death outside China,"" Rabindra Abeyasinghe, the WHO representative to the Philippines, told reporters. ""However, we need to take into mind that this is not a locally acquired case. This patient came from the epicentre of this outbreak,"" Abeyasinghe added. The 44-year-old man arrived in the Philippines with a Chinese woman who had also tested positive for the virus, health secretary Francisco Duque said. The man developed severe pneumonia after being admitted to a government hospital in Manila on Jan 25, the Department of Health said. While the patient who died was ""stable and showed signs of improvement"" during his last few days in the hospital, his condition deteriorated in the 24 hours before he died, Duque told reporters. She was the Philippines' first case of the virus and is recovering in hospital.  Twenty-four patients previously under investigation for infection tested negative for the new coronavirus, while samples from four other patients were still being tested, the health department said. Passengers aboard the flights of the two positive cases were being traced, he said. The two patients had taken Cebu Pacific flights from Hong Kong to Cebu and from Cebu to Dumaguete in central Philippines, the airline said in a statement. The cabin crew and pilots on affected flights have been quarantined, and the aircraft have undergone thorough disinfection, it said. Cebu Air and two other Philippine carriers, Philippine Airlines and the local unit of AirAsia Group Bhd, have cancelled flights to China this month, joining many others around the world that have done the same. CLOSING BORDERS The WHO last week declared the situation a global health emergency. The first foreign fatality came as an escalating number of governments around the world closed their borders to people from China in a bid to stop it spreading. The Philippines announced it would immediately halt the arrivals of any foreign travellers from China. The United States, Australia and Israel have banned foreign nationals from visiting if they had been in China over the previous 14 days, and warned their own citizens from travelling there. Mongolia, Russia and Nepal closed their land borders, while Papua New Guinea went as far as to ban anyone arriving from ports or airports across Asia. The death toll in China soared to 304 on Sunday, with authorities reporting 45 new deaths from the previous day. There were 2,590 new confirmed cases in China, bringing the total to nearly 14,500.

09 Feb 2020 01:56AM,Novel coronavirus case numbers 'stabilising' in China: WHO,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners GENEVA: The number of cases of the deadly novel coronavirus being reported on a daily basis in China is ""stabilising"", the World Health Organization said on Saturday (Feb 8). The UN health agency said this was ""good news"" but cautioned that it was too early to make any predictions about whether the virus might have peaked. ""There has been a stabilisation in the number of cases reported from Hubei,"" Michael Ryan, head of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, said at a briefing in Geneva. The central Chinese province of Hubei has been at the epicentre of the virus outbreak and has been placed under lockdown by the authorities in an effort to contain the virus. ""We're in a four-day stable period where the number of reported cases hasn't advanced. That's good news and may reflect the impact of the control measures that have been put in place,"" Ryan said. But he added that it was ""very early to make any predictions"". WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the trend was ""not really accelerating"" but also called for ""caution"". The coronavirus has infected more than 34,500 people and killed more than 700. Tedros warned against misinformation about the virus, saying it made the work of healthcare staff harder. ""We're not just battling the virus, we're also battling the trolls and conspiracy theorists that push misinformation and undermine the outbreak response,"" he said. Asked about a planned WHO-led international mission to China, he also said a list of names had been submitted to Chinese authorities and the team leader would be travelling there on Monday or Tuesday. ""The rest of the experts will also follow after that,"" he said. Asked if the mission would include members of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), he said: ""I hope so"". China has been critical of measures taken by the United States in response to the virus and has so far rejected an offer of assistance from the CDC.

04 Feb 2020 07:04AM,China coronavirus death toll soars past 400,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The number of confirmed deaths from the coronavirus outbreak spiked to 426 in China, after authorities in Hubei province reported 64 new fatalities and Hong Kong reported its first fatality on Tuesday (Feb 4). In its daily update, figures from the health commission in Hubei, which has been hit hardest by the virus, also showed a sharp increase in confirmed infections with 3,235 new cases. That puts the national total at more than 20,400, based on numbers previously issued by the central government.   The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency, although experts say much is still unknown about the pathogen including its lethality. ""We expect to see more cases of person-to-person spread,"" said Dr Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The epidemic is believed to have emerged in December from a market that sold wild game in the Hubei provincial capital Wuhan. At least 151 cases have been reported in 23 other countries and regions, including Japan, Thailand, Singapore, the United States and Britain. There has been one death outside China, in the Philippines.   With Wuhan and some other cities in virtual lockdown, travel severely restricted and China facing increasing international isolation, fears of wider economic disruption are growing; sources at the OPEC oil cartel said producers were considering cutting output by almost a third to support prices. Airlines around the world have stopped flights to parts of China. A suspension by the United Arab Emirates on Monday will affect the Gulf airlines Etihad and Emirates. The outbreak is reminiscent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a virus from the same family that emerged in China in 2002 and killed almost 800 people around the world out of the 8,000 or so who were infected. Chinese data suggest that the new virus, while much more contagious than SARS, is significantly less lethal, although such numbers can evolve rapidly. Some economists predict world economic output will be cut by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points due to China's lockdown. Countries continued to fly evacuation flights for citizens out of Wuhan. A planeload of Australians left the city on Monday and arrived in the Indian Ocean territory of Christmas Island, where they will be quarantined, media reported on Tuesday. The United States, which flew people out last week, is planning ""a handful more flights"" while Russia was due to start evacuating its citizens from Wuhan on Monday. The White House said China had accepted its offer to have US experts as part of a WHO mission to study and help combat the virus.

07 Feb 2020 12:01PM,29th coronavirus case visited Seletar clinic before being sent to hospital,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The 41-year-old man identified on Thursday (Feb 6) as Singapore’s 29th confirmed case of novel coronavirus had visited the Seletar clinic of Phoenix Medical Group twice before his infection was confirmed. In a circular dated Feb 6, the Phoenix Medical Group said the man had visited its clinic in Seletar last Thursday and again on Monday. The man appeared “quite ill” with gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms, as well as a moderate fever when he visited the clinic on Monday, and was asked to go to the emergency department, the group said. He did not fulfil the Health Ministry’s (MOH) criteria for a suspected case of the coronavirus and as such was not sent to the hospital using a dedicated ambulance service, the circular said. MOH then brought the case to Phoenix Medical’s attention at around midday on Thursday for active contact tracing, it added, noting the group was informed that his infection was confirmed later that night. The 41-year-old, who is a Singapore citizen, had no recent travel history to mainland China and no known links with the other confirmed cases of the virus. In its statement on Thursday, MOH said the man had developed a fever on Jan 28, five days after the first confirmed case of the coronavirus here was reported. The ministry said that he had visited a general practitioner’s clinic on Jan 29, and subsequently sought treatment at another clinic on Jan 30, before being admitted to the Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital on Monday. MOH did not name the clinics. On Wednesday at about 11pm, test results confirmed the man was infected by the coronavirus. “Epidemiological investigations and contact tracing are ongoing to identify individuals who had close contact with the case, and to establish any link he may have had with confirmed cases in Singapore or travellers from mainland China,” MOH said in its statement. “We are interviewing the patient and his close contacts, and investigating the locations he had recently been to,” it added. Dr Chua Hshan Cher, a general practitioner at the clinic, said they initially considered the possibility of a coronavirus infection to be low as he did not meet the criteria stipulated by MOH. The patient was tested for dengue fever and influenza last Thursday, both of which came back negative, he added. They also considered the possibility that he might have sepsis. When he came back on Monday, his symptoms had worsened and he developed gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite and loose stools. ""We referred him to hospital because there was progression of symptoms, no response to treatment and the patient appeared to be unwell,"" Dr Chua said. In the Phoenix Medical Group’s circular – signed by three of the clinic’s doctors – it said all the rooms, corridors, table tops, seats and examination couches had been ""deep cleansed"" between 6pm and 9pm on Thursday. The clinic had also engaged the mall operator's help in changing all the filters in the air conditioners, said Dr Chua. ""We've also implemented a strict recommendation of daily temperature taking, hourly sanitation and ensuring that any staff who feels unwell is sent home immediately."" He added that masks are compulsory for staff.   Previous measures include a questionnaire asking patients if they have travelled to China in the past two weeks or had contact with anyone who had been to China within the same time period. They also ask for patients for their occupation, so as to identify frontline jobs that may expose the patients to potential Chinese visitors. The doctor who attended to the man is on a voluntary leave of absence until Feb 17, and is currently well, it noted. “We would like to assure members of the public, patients and well-meaning family and friends that we will remain vigilant against the scourge of the novel coronavirus and continue our fight against it,” Phoenix Medical said in the circular.

04 Feb 2020 06:30AM,Commentary: Novel coronavirus reveals old vulnerabilities in the global economy,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners The novel coronavirus has the potential to become a big enough shock that reveals the weaknesses of central banks and sluggish global growth, says Mohamed El-Erian. NEWPORT BEACH, California: Last week’s fretting over the coronavirus was a good illustration of a tug of war that has been playing out in financial markets for a while: Between favourable sentiment and mounting longer-term economic uncertainties. Until now, at least, that contest has been resolved in favour of ever-higher stock prices. But investors need to decide if they want to opt for more of the same, by continuing to implement an investment playbook that has served them well, or if they want to treat the viral outbreak for what it is — a big economic shock that could derail global growth and shake markets out of their “buy-the-dip” conditioning. Entering 2020, investors faced the challenge of balancing favourable short-term market technicals with weaker fundamentals, and doing so with government bonds providing little protection given the very low — and, in some cases, negative — level of yields in advanced countries. NOVEL VULNERABILITIES The coronavirus outbreak amplifies two vulnerabilities: Structurally weak global growth and less effective central banks. It is becoming harder for markets to treat such fragilities as being beyond the immediate horizon, especially with a host of other uncertainties not far behind, including the recurrence of trade tensions, growing realisation of the impact of climate change, technological shocks, political polarisation and changing demographics. Retail, trade and travel are simple ways to illustrate what is going on in China. Stores are facing dramatic disruptions involving a virtual halt in traffic, while suppliers are finding it harder and slower to move their merchandise, both within and in and out of the country. And there is a huge drop in travel to China, dealing another blow to economic activities undermined by less internal mobility. This virtual stoppage of economic activities is cascading throughout the second-largest economy in the world, and one with considerable regional and global ties. It is fundamentally weakening the country’s services sector, at a time of considerable challenges for manufacturing. CHINA SLOWDOWN With both engines of growth now sputtering, internal and external, China will also find it harder to navigate its transition from a middle-income economy. The country’s increasing “sudden stop” economic dynamics also involve adverse spill-over effects, first and foremost for emerging Asian economies with strong economic and financial linkages with China.   A weakening China is also a problem for Europe, where the European Central Bank is effectively out of productive ammunition and politicians are yet to implement a comprehensive pro-growth policy package. And with the virus affecting the movement of people and goods, there is an increased risk of a multi-year process of de-globalisation that neither the global economy nor markets are wired for. The coronavirus also has the potential to constitute a structural break for markets: A big enough shock that fundamentally shifts sentiment. NEW GAME PLAN Previously, markets had been underpinned by the belief that central banks were always willing and able to repress volatility and boost asset prices. That fuelled investors’ fear of missing out on a seemingly never-ending rally. Until last Friday (Jan 31) when US stocks dropped about 2 per cent, markets’ inclination was to respond to sell-offs by deploying a game plan that worked well in 2019 and early 2020, including in response to shocks such as the US missile attack that killed a top Iranian general and the disruption to half of Saudi Arabia’s oil production.   For the previous year, traders and investors quickly bought every dip in the belief that the latest shock would prove temporary, contained and reversible. Now, the multi-year gap between elevated asset prices and weaker economic conditions is becoming increasingly unsustainable. The global economy and markets are getting closer to the neck of a T-junction. What comes after that involves a stark contrast, depending on how policymakers respond. One way involves recession, financial instability and even more complicated politics; the other, a genuine growth process that validates elevated asset prices in an orderly fashion and opens the way for more constructive politics. If investors still insist on immediately buying dips, they should do so in a much more differentiated manner by favouring higher-quality issuers that are underpinned by strong balance sheets. They should also avoid swapping US assets for more international exposure, which — although more attractively valued — is much less resilient to global economic weakness. For the remainder, which is probably most investors, they should consider that this latest shock to fundamentals could prove severe enough to dislodge for a while the bullish market conditioning that has been so critical to this historic stock rally. Given that the negative economic effects of the virus are yet to be sufficiently absorbed by markets, this also calls for much greater immediate attention to potential vulnerabilities in portfolios, in the form of equity and liquidity risk.

05 Feb 2020 03:26PM,"Cathay Pacific asks 27,000 employees to take unpaid leave as coronavirus outbreak hit demand","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners HONG KONG: Hong Kong's flagship carrier Cathay Pacific is asking its entire workforce to take up to three weeks of unpaid leave, its CEO announced on Wednesday (Feb 5), as the airline battles a fall in demand caused by a coronavirus outbreak. The request lays bare desperate times at Cathay, which was hammered last year by months of political chaos and protests in Hong Kong and is now being further hurt by the fallout from the virus outbreak. On Tuesday, the carrier said it planned to cut about 30 per cent of capacity over the next two months, including about 90 per cent of flights to mainland China. In a video message to the company's 27,000 employees, airline boss Augustus Tang said they were being asked to take up to three weeks leave with no pay between March and June. ""I am hoping all of you will participate, from our frontline employees to our senior leaders, and share in our current challenges,"" he said. The leave is not mandatory, a spokeswoman for Cathay said in a separate statement, but it is encouraged. The coronavirus, which was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, spread over the Chinese New Year holiday, which would normally be one of the busiest times for regional airlines. Instead, dozens of international carriers have reduced or suspended flights to China in a bid to halt the pathogen's spread and as passenger numbers fall off a cliff. Tang warned Cathay was experiencing ""one of the most difficult Chinese New Year holidays we have ever had"" because of the virus. ""And we don't know how long it will last,"" he added. ""With such an uncertain outlook, preserving our cash is now the key to protecting our business."" 'DIFFICULT TO HEAR' He announced a series of measures to tackle the crisis, including asking staff to voluntarily take unpaid leave. ""I realise this is difficult to hear, and we may need to take further steps ahead, but by supporting the special leave scheme you will be helping at our time of need,"" he told staff. He also asked suppliers to reduce their prices, and said the airline would make short-term adjustments to its capacity - including an already announced move to cut flights 30 per cent worldwide for two months, including a 90 per cent cut to mainland China. The last time Cathay asked staff to take unpaid leave was in 2009 in the wake of the global financial crash. ""The situation now is just as grave,"" Tang said. Hong Kong's economy is currently in recession, battered by the US-China trade war, the protests, and the virus outbreak have hit the tourism and entertainment industries especially hard. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a global health emergency. The coronavirus has spread rapidly in China with nearly 25,000 people infected and 490 deaths, most in Wuhan and the surrounding province of Hubei. Hong Kong reported its first coronavirus death on Tuesday. Nearly 230 cases have been reported in 27 other countries and regions outside mainland China, according to a Reuters tally based on official statements from the authorities involved. Several countries have also reported human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus, including in Singapore and Thailand.

01 Feb 2020 06:01AM,FAQ: Wuhan coronavirus and its outbreak,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners CNA enlisted the help of medical experts to help answer some of your most asked questions. SINGAPORE: The coronavirus originating from China’s Wuhan city is spreading quickly in the country as well as across borders since it was first declared on the last day of 2019. Since then, the deadly pathogen has killed more than 200 people and infected nearly 10,000 in China alone. It has also reached more than 20 places across the world, with Hong Kong, Japan and Thailand among the highest counts of confirmed cases.  In Singapore, there have been 16 confirmed cases so far, all imported. CNA asked readers to submit questions on the coronavirus outbreak and had an overwhelming response. Questions ranged from how the virus is spread and whether it will affect pregnant women and their children.  To answer these, we enlisted the help of medical experts such as those from the Duke-NUS Medical School - Professor Gregory Gray, Assistant Professor Danielle Anderson and Professor Wang Linfa, who was also part of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) emergency committee looking into the virus outbreak - as well as Professor Benjamin Neuman, chair of Biological Sciences from Texas A&M University. Their lightly edited answers are as follows: Question: What is the difference between symptoms of Wuhan virus and flu/common cold? Prof Gray: They are very similar. Clinically, it is difficult to distinguish between the two; one really needs to use laboratory-based tests in order to do so. Prof Wang: Not much. Asst Prof Anderson: The symptoms of the flu and the Wuhan coronavirus are very similar and include fever, coughing and a runny nose.   Q: Can people recover naturally from the Wuhan coronavirus just like the common cold? Prof Gray: Yes. The vast majority will fully recover after their illness. Prof Wang: Yes, and the majority do. Asst Prof Anderson: Yes, people can recover naturally following infection and the majority of patients (98 per cent) do indeed recover. But while it is possible to recover from infection, some patients can develop severe disease and pneumonia. Q: How does the virus affect pregnant women and will it be transmitted to the unborn child? Prof Wang: It is not known yet. Prof Gray: Unknown, but pregnant women are often at increased risk of respiratory infections. Asst Prof Anderson: Currently there is not enough information available to determine if there is maternal transmission to the unborn child. A pregnant woman may develop more severe disease as they are immunocompromised and are more susceptible to complications of respiratory infections. Q: How should parents protect children under the age of 1 from the coronavirus? Prof Gray: Avoid having them come in contact with the public, especially people with respiratory signs and symptoms. Q: Can the virus be spread through water such as via swimming pools? Or through one’s eyes? Prof Gray: We don’t know, but other respiratory viruses can, such as adenovirus which is a hardier type of virus. Prof Wang: Transmission through the swimming pool is unlikely unless the person is swimming very close to an infected person. Yes, it is possible to be infected through the eyes. Asst Prof Anderson: It is unlikely that the coronavirus can be spread through water, especially chlorinated swimming pools. Coronaviruses are also not known to be spread though the eyes. There is an anecdotal case of infection through the eye and, if this infection did occur, it is an extremely rare event.   Q: How are those infected with the coronavirus being treated? What’s the success rate? Prof Wang: It is mostly just normal hospital care for severe cases. I have been told all confirmed cases (of the Wuhan coronavirus) are doing well in Singapore. There are drugs being tried in China, but it is too early to scientifically gauge their success rate. Asst Prof Anderson: If a patient has respiratory symptoms they may require breathing support. In milder cases, they can be given an intravenous drip to maintain blood pressure. Fluids can also be given in cases of diarrhoea, and ibuprofen or Panadol can be used for pain relief. Prof Gray: There is no specific treatment yet recognised as effective. Success rates are being determined now for supportive care. The mortality rate is low, less than 3 per cent, and likely will be lower as more people fully recover. (According to the WHO, global fatality rate for SARS patients was at 11 per cent) Q: Is the Wuhan coronavirus going to mutate further? Prof Gray: We don’t know, but the good news is that so far the 2019-nCoV virus is not changing. Prof Wang: All viruses mutate in nature. But so far, the Wuhan coronavirus seems to be quite stable. Q: Will tropical weather affect the spread of the virus? If yes, how? Prof Gray: Ultraviolet light can often kill respiratory viruses. Prof Wang: No scientific evidence for that yet. Q: How do you think this coronavirus outbreak will end? Prof Neuman: As a person who likes to make anti-viral drugs, things that actually slow down the virus, I can say that (better weather patterns or health measures) are probably not going to be the end (of the virus outbreak). And a vaccine will probably not going to be the end. It’s old-fashioned stuff like quarantines - basically keeping infected people away from healthy people that actually beat viruses like this. The risk is there are only so many quarantine facilities available in mainland China and only so many facilities to keep people properly treated while they are being treated for the virus. So if there are too many people that turn up sick, and overwhelm the systems that are there, that is potentially a risk.   We’ve seen China build new hospitals very quickly... so I believe they realise this possible risk and are trying to combat it - which is actually very good news. Q: Can you predict how long the virus will last? Prof Gray: I don’t expect to see a quick resolution. We are seeing the epidemic expand into other countries now. Prof Wang: No expert can do such a prediction as this is a highly complex matter. Even the experts at WHO are monitoring and assessing daily. However, the next two weeks will be critical when the Chinese New Year holiday ends in China. If we see a decrease in two to three weeks, I am hopeful we can control this. Asst Prof Anderson: It is difficult to predict when the peak of infection will occur. If the quarantine measures are effective and patients can be isolated for 14 days, the outbreak should end.

13 Feb 2020 06:11AM,"F&B, retail businesses in CBD feel pinch as people work from home amid coronavirus concerns","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Valentine’s Day is the occasion when Mdm Wong Li Hua makes the most money in the year. But the florist was visibly frustrated when she spoke to CNA. Sales at her shop at The Arcade have fallen by 50 per cent compared to the same period last year after Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) alert level to Orange last Friday, Mdm Wong said. Since the announcement, companies islandwide commenced their business continuity plans to limit the spread of the COVID-19. Many, including the financial institutions and technology giants that have offices in the Central Business District (CBD), have arranged to split employees’ shifts or have them work from home. Besides fewer walk-in customers because those who work in the area are staying at home, the closure of the linkways between The Arcade and Clifford Centre has caused some confusion among her customers, Mdm Wong said.   Some who finally made their way to her shop said they thought her store was closed, the florist said. “Who isn’t worried,” Mdm Wong said in Mandarin of the virus creating a dent in her business. “Every year, we rely on this occasion to earn money.” At lunchtime on Wednesday (Feb 12) afternoon, the CBD was still visibly bustling with office workers, but most owners and staff of the 13 eateries and retailers located in the area CNA spoke to said that sales are down anywhere between 10 and 50 per cent since the beginning of this week. Other shopkeepers at The Arcade also saw a dip in sales. At minimart Haja T&T Trading, its owner Haja Aladudeen said that against last week's records, his daily takings have tumbled by 40 per cent. He does not know what to do to shore up his business and can only fret in the meantime, he said.   ZTP Ginseng Birdnest supervisor Loh Ken Tiam said that the Chinese medicinal shop has seen daily earnings dip by 30 per cent compared to last week. On a normal day, the shop takes in about S$2,000 to S$3,000, he said. Over at Tanjong Pagar, the situation was similar. Tomy Chen, the co-owner of Pho Stop at Downtown Gallery, said that sales fell by 20 per cent on Monday, and 30 per cent on Tuesday and Wednesday compared to the same period last week. If dine-in sales continue to fall, Mr Chen said some staff will be transferred to their delivery kitchens located at Lavender and Katong. He is hoping that an increase in demand for food deliveries will offset the dip at their CBD outlet. Lum Von-Nie, who runs the Basil & Mint hawker stall at Amoy Road Food Centre, said that delivery orders have helped to cushion some of the dip in revenue. For example, she earned 20 per cent less on Tuesday week-on-week, but deliveries cut her losses by 10 per cent.   “It’s good that the authorities are quick to respond to false news, so hopefully that helps assure the public that there is no reason not to eat out,” Ms Lum, who runs the stall alone, said, “But yes, (I’m) bracing for the worst."" It is a difficult situation to be in, especially as F&B businesses operate on thin profit margins, said Mr Willin Low, owner of Relish@Frasers Tower. His lunch business has dropped by 45 to 55 per cent. Mr Low said he is in talks with other restaurant owners to see if they can come up with a plan collectively to tide through this period. “Hopefully regular customers and landlords will support restaurants to keep them in business,” he added. But for some others, it is business as usual. One Korean grocery store shop assistant, who asked not to be named as he was not authorised to speak, said that sales have been brisk, especially over the weekend when people came to stock up on rice and instant noodles. OFFICE STAFF WORKING FROM HOME Last Friday, the Singapore Government moved the DORSCON status to Orange. The Ministry of Health urged companies to “step up” their business continuity plan, with suggestions that employees could telecommute or be divided into separate teams. Banks, technology firms and property consultancies with offices in the CBD have heeded the advice and kickstarted their segregation strategies. United Overseas Bank (UOB) said in a media statement on Monday (Feb 10) that it activated its business continuity plans for all critical functions and services, with employees working from split sites, from home and on split shifts. Similar measures have been put in place at DBS, according to a spokesperson. Its 12,000 employees across Singapore, either work from home or from separate sites. A DBS employee was confirmed on Wednesday to be infected by the coronavirus, prompting the bank to evacuate 300 of its staff members from its offices on the 43rd floor at Tower 3 of Marina Bay Financial Centre.   Twitter, whose Asia-Pacific headquarters is located in CapitaGreen, said that they have a “cross-functional operational taskforce in place (to) take necessary measures, including work from home policies, to protect our people and our business operations”. Tech giant Facebook said that they have “taken steps to protect the health and safety of our employees”, although the company already has a flexible working approach in place. Microsoft noted a similar arrangement in their response. Facebook and Microsoft’s Singapore offices are located at Marina One and Frasers Towers, respectively. Real estate firm Colliers International, which has 350 employees in Singapore and an office in Asia Square, said that it has encouraged all its staff to work from home following the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. “This flexible work arrangement will remain in place until the end of March 2020 and we will review the need to extend it,” its managing director Tang Wei Leng said. Staff based at CBRE’s offices are also split into teams who are either working from home or at the office, the company said. Employees who are pregnant and those with prior respiratory conditions will work from home. The property consultancy has about 1,600 employees in Singapore. Four hundred are based in one of its two offices at Paya Lebar Quarter or Six Battery Road. The rest of the estimated 1,200 are based off-site in clients’ offices.
