17 Feb 2020 06:14AM,"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. ˚Ä˚Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,˚Ä˚ said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. ˚Ä˚Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn˚Ä˚t kill that much.˚Ä˚ This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. ˚Ä˚This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ˚Ä˚burns out˚Ä˚ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,˚Ä˚ said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. ÅEÄÅEThere is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ÅEÄÅEsinisterÅEÄÅE, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.ÅEÄÅE According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. ÅEÄÅEI believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed ma""nd virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,ÅEÄÅE said Dr Leong. ÅEÄÅECOVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.ÅEÄÅE According to Dr Leong, there is a ÅEÄÅEnatural tendencyÅEÄÅE for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spre""if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. ""This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: ÅEÄÅEIt becomes another flu bug",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600
16 Feb 2020 09:26AM,Cruise firm seeks new COVID-19 test for American passenger from ship in Cambodia,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia: More tests are needed to confirm that an American passenger from a cruise ship docked in Cambodia has the new coronavirus after she tested positive in Malaysia, the MS Westerdam's operator said on Sunday (Feb 16). The 83-year-old woman was the first passenger from the MS Westerdam, operated by Carnival Corp unit Holland America Inc, to test positive for the virus. ""While the first results have been reported, they are preliminary at this point and we are awaiting secondary testing for confirmation,"" Holland America said in a statement. Cambodian authorities called on Malaysia to review its test results. Holland America said 236 passengers and 747 crew remained aboard the vessel, which is docked in the Cambodian port of Sihanoukville. It arrived on Thursday carrying 1,455 passengers and 802 crew. It had spent two weeks at sea after being turned away by Japan, Taiwan, Guam, the Philippines and Thailand. The passengers were tested regularly on board and Cambodia also tested 20 once it docked. None was found to have the new coronavirus that has killed more than 1,500 people, the vast majority in China. The American woman flew to Malaysia on Friday from Cambodia along with 144 others from the ship, the Malaysian health ministry said in a statement, adding that she was in stable condition. The woman's husband had shown symptoms but tested negative, it said. The couple were the only ones among the 145 to show symptoms, the ministry said. Cambodia's government said its own tests had been done in collaboration with the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""The Ministry of Health requests the Malaysian authorities to review the results of the test,"" Cambodia's Ministry of Health said in statement. There are widespread fears that cruise ships around Asia may be spreading the virus. The biggest cluster outside China has been on the Diamond Princess, quarantined off Japan's Yokohama. Out of about 3,700 passengers and crew on board, 285 people have tested positive and been sent to hospital. Vietnam turned back two ships on Friday. The American woman's case brings the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Malaysia to 22. An 80-year-old Chinese tourist infected with the coronavirus has died in France, the first fatality in Europe and the fourth outside mainland China. Most of the deaths so far have been in the central Chinese province of Hubei, where the virus is believed to have originated at a wildlife market.

12 Feb 2020 06:34PM,"3 new cases of COVID-19 in Singapore, including DBS employee, 2 church employees","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore has three new cases of COVID-19, director of medical services at the Ministry of Health (MOH) Kenneth Mak said at a media conference on Wednesday (Feb 12). Of them, two are from the Grace Assembly of God church, and one of them works at DBS bank at the Marina Bay Financial Centre. All three of them are Singaporean and have no recent travel history to mainland China. The two patients linked to the church are two male employees aged 34 and 46 who visited both Grace Assembly of God churches at Tanglin and Bukit Batok, MOH said. The church said on its Facebook page that it will stop all church services and activities for two weeks. The DBS employee is 62 years old. This brings the number of confirmed cases of the virus in Singapore to 50.     As of Wednesday, six more people were discharged from hospital, bringing the total number of patients who have recovered to 15. The newly discharged patients are cases 4, 12, 25, 29, 34 and 40, all of whom are adults. They are a 36-year-old man and 37-year-old woman from Wuhan who stayed at Village Hotel Sentosa, the husband of a tour guide linked a cluster of infections, a 41-year-old Singaporean who was the first one reported not to have any known links to previous cases, and two Yong Thai Hang employees. Of the 35 confirmed cases still in hospital, eight are in the Intensive Care Unit and in critical condition. Assoc Prof Mak said that a six-month-old, who is among the confirmed cases, is doing well. On the sidelines of the media conference, he said that there has yet to be a pattern established among those who are in intensive care. Health Minister Gan Kim Yong cautioned that while there are patients who are stable and recovering from the viral infection, there could be patients who may succumb to it. ˚Ä˚We have to be prepared for the worst,˚Ä˚ he said. As of noon on Wednesday, 638 suspect cases had tested negative. Test results for 125 cases are pending, MOH said. It added that as of the same time, it has identified 1,090 close contacts of the confirmed cases, of whom 984 are in Singapore. Of them, 961 have been contacted and are being isolated or quarantined. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining 23 contacts in Singapore, it said. CASE 48 The 34-year-old man, an employee of Grace Assembly of God church, reported onset of symptoms on Feb 1 and sought treatment at four private clinics over more than a week. Before he was admitted at the NCID he visited shopping mall Plaza Singapura and Fusionopolis in One North. He lives in Bukit Batok. CASE 49 The 46-year-old man, an employee of Grace Assembly of God church, reported onset of symptoms on Feb 3, and sought treatment at a general practitioner five days later. On the same day, he went to the emergency department at the National University Hospital (NUH) and was discharged. He was admitted to NUH two days later. CASE 50 The 62-year-old man, an employee of DBS was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on Wednesday morning. On Wednesday, DBS said an employee had been infected with the coronavirus, prompting the bank to take precautionary measures and have employees at the affected Marina Bay Financial Centre office work from home. The bank is conducting con""act tracing with all employees and any others the infected person may have come into contact with. Assoc Prof Mak urged people not to ""doctor hop"", so that the doctors who visit can monitor them and their symptoms accurately.   HEALTHCARE WORKERS DESERVE SUPPORT Mr Gan also appealed to Singaporeans not to shun healthcare workers, who are on the frontline taking care of patients. He urged them to show these workers ÅEÄÅEwell-deservedÅEÄÅE support. ÅEÄÅEA kind word or warm greeting can go a long way,ÅEÄÅE he said.   Mr Gan also thanked general practitioners who are on the frontline, and play a critical role in detecting and managing patients. He said that his ministry will put aside 1 million masks for private doctors, including specialists. Some of them have given feedback that they are concerned about the supply of masks, he said. ""like to take this opportunity to assure them that they would get the supplies that they need because they are a part of our team,"" he said. Last week, authorities raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange, prompting additional precautionary measures. The coronavirus outbreak is expected to take a toll on the tourism sector, with the Singapore Tourism Board on Tuesday saying visitor arrivals are estimated to fall by 25 per cent to 30 per cent this year. The virus, officially named COVID-19 on Tuesday, has killed more than 1,100 people and infected nearly 45,000 since it emerged in China at the end of last year. It has since spread beyond China to 24 other countries, with the World Health Organization declaring a public health emergency last month. South Korea and Israel have told their citizens to defer travel to Singapore, while Indonesia and Taiwan have recommended precautions be taken when visiting the country.

16 Feb 2020 07:12AM,"China COVID-19 toll leaps past 1,600 as new cases slow","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The number of new cases from China's coronavirus epidemic dropped for a third consecutive day on Sunday (Feb 16), as the World Health Organization (WHO) chief warned it was ""impossible"" to predict how the outbreak would develop. Global concern remains high about the spread of the virus, which first emerged in China's central Hubei province in December, with the first death outside Asia reported in France this weekend. The death toll jumped to 1,665 in mainland China on Sunday after 142 more people died from the virus. More than 68,000 people have now been infected - but the number of new cases of the COVID-19 strain continued to decline. In hardest-hit Hubei, the number of new cases slowed for a third consecutive day and at 139, the number of deaths was level with Saturday's toll. The number of new cases in other parts of the country has dropped for twelve straight days. The WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned however that it was ""impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". ""We ask all governments, companies, and news organisations to work with us to sound the appropriate level of alarm without fanning the flames of hysteria,"" he said, speaking at the Munich Security Conference. ""China has bought the world time. We don't know how much time."" The UN health body has asked China for more details on how diagnoses are being made. An international team of WHO experts will arrive in Beijing this weekend for a joint mission with Chinese counterparts. QUARANTINED CRUISE SHIP The scale of the epidemic ballooned on Thursday after authorities in Hubei changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding thousands of new patients to their tally. Hubei added more than 14,000 cases in a single day after officials there started counting people clinically diagnosed through lung imaging, in addition to those with a positive lab test result. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. Local authorities around the country have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading. Beijing's municipal government has enacted a rule requiring all people coming to the capital to quarantine themselves for 14 days, warning that violators would be punished, according to official media. Outside mainland China, an 80-year-old Chinese tourist in France was the fourth person to die from the new coronavirus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong and Japan. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship off Japan, with 335 infections now as dozens more cases were confirmed. A US State Department spokesperson said Americans stranded on the vessel would be evacuated, and would face a further quarantine of two weeks in the United States. Hong Kong authorities also announced it would charter a flight for city residents on the ship, who would stay at a quarantine centre for 14 days on their return. Several countries have banned arrivals from China and major airlines have cut services to the country. SOCIAL STABILITY The virus spread last month as millions travelled across the country for the Chinese New Year holiday, which was extended to try and prevent more infections. People have slowly started to return to work in the past two weeks, though many are doing their jobs from home and schools remain closed. With the government facing criticism over its handling of the crisis, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for tighter policing to protect social stability. The government must ""increase use of police force and strengthen the visible use of police"", to ensure stability during the crisis, Xi said in a February 3 speech published by state media on Saturday. China's central bank said it will also disinfect banknotes with ultraviolet light or high temperatures and store them for up to 14 days before they are put back into circulation.

19 Feb 2020 10:09AM,South Korea COVID-19 cases jump by two-thirds in one day,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SEOUL: South Korea reported 20 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday (Feb 19), increasing its total by nearly two-thirds, including a cluster of at least 16 centred on the southern city of Daegu. The trade-dependent South has been hit by the economic fallout from the virus outbreak in neighbouring China, but until Wednesday's jump, its own case numbers had hardly changed for several days. The Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said in a statement that 20 new coronavirus cases had been confirmed, raising its total from 31 to 51. Of those, 18 were in Daegu and neighbouring North Gyeongsang province, with 15 of them believed to be linked to a single patient, a 61-year-old woman. Fourteen of them attended the same church as the woman, the KCDC said, while the other one came into contact with her at a hospital. She had first developed a fever on Feb 10 but reportedly refused to be tested for coronavirus on the grounds she had not recently travelled abroad. She was not put into quarantine until a week later and was confirmed as the country's 31st case on Tuesday. Seoul has blocked entry to foreigners coming from Hubei, the Chinese province that is the epicentre of the outbreak, and suspended visa-free entry to the island of Jeju, popular with Chinese tourists, but has not imposed a general ban on arrivals from China.

The Public Utilities (Amendment) Bill will be introduced for the first time during Tuesday's sitting. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat will also deliver the year's Budget speech at 3pm.  Members of Parliament have submitted more than 20 questions on a range of issues, with several such as Png Eng Huat and Desmond Choo asking about the Government's measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, as well as the estimated economic impact of the outbreak. The virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has killed nearly 1,800 and infected more than 70,000 worldwide. In Singapore, the Ministry of Health announced two new cases on Monday, bringing the total number of cases in the city to 77. A total of 24 who were infected with the virus have made a full recovery and have been discharged. Amid concerns about the COVID-19 outbreak, the Ministry of Trade and Industry on Monday cut the year's GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5%. Members of Parliament have also tabled questions about Singapore's employment landscape. MP Pritam Singh will ask the Manpower Minister about industries that find it difficult to attract or hire PMET Singaporeans, while MP Lim Biow Chuan will ask about the number of complaints received in the last three years regarding excessive foreigners working in financial institutions. Meanwhile, MP Foo Mee Har will ask about plans to help gig economy workers access group insurance, as well as save for retirement and home ownership. MP Cheng Li Hui will ask whether a transport start-up without a moneylender license is allowed to offer loans to their drivers at a high administration fee, and whether there will be Government regulation on companies offering similar services operating within the grey area of the law. On other issues, MP Lee Bee Wah will ask about the number of complaints the Traffic Police have received about noisy vehicles and how many of these pertain to her constituency, while NMP Anthea Ong will ask about the percentage of Grassroots Advisors appointed by the People's Association that are members of a political party, as well as whether the Government has plans to review sexual education in schools. MP Louis Ng will ask about the number of individuals and organisations that have been prosecuted due to shipments of elephant and pangolin scales seized at Singapore's borders in 2019.

17 Feb 2020 04:50PM,"Facing uptick in COVID-19 infections, Japan moves to limit public crowds","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TOKYO: Japan said on Monday (Feb 17) it would limit public crowds in Tokyo to prevent a further spread of the deadly coronavirus, scrapping the emperor's birthday celebrations and closing next month's Tokyo Marathon to all but elite professional runners. The widening fallout of the outbreak, which began in China in December and has killed more than 1,700 people, is threatening large public events and damaging output and tourism in Japan. A further spread of COVID-19 could undermine growth and potentially push the country into recession, analysts say. Citing ""circumstances"", the Imperial Household Agency said it would cancel Emperor Naruhito's public birthday address on Feb 23, his first since his coronation last year. The event regularly attracts tens of thousands of people to the inner grounds of the Imperial Palace in the heart of Tokyo. The last time the emperor's birthday celebration was cancelled was 1996, amid a hostage crisis at the Japanese embassy in Peru. Organisers of the Tokyo Marathon, one of the world's biggest such races, say the 38,000 general participants who signed up for the Mar 1 race will not be allowed to compete, a person with knowledge of the issue told Reuters. Instead, the event will be limited to top-level competitors. A total of 176 elite runners and 30 elite wheelchair athletes are registered for the race. Shares of some of the marathon's sponsors fell. Seiko Holdings, the maker of watches and clocks, slid 3.5 per cent, as did shoe and sportswear maker ASICS. The broader Tokyo market was little changed. The marathon is not the only international sporting event in Japan the virus has affected: The FIBA Asia Cup 2021 postponed a qualifying basketball game between Japan and China, originally scheduled to be held near Tokyo this week. NURSE TESTS POSITIVE As the number of people infected in Japan has risen above 400, most of them passengers on a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, a hospital outside Tokyo said it would stop admitting new patients after one of its staff tested positive for the virus. The hospital in Sagamihara, 50km west of Tokyo, said a nurse was infected after treating an inpatient who died of the disease this month. On Monday morning, a fifth government-chartered flight carrying 65 Japanese arrived in Tokyo from Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the outbreak, bringing the total number repatriated from the city to 763, broadcaster NHK reported. Hundreds of passengers are preparing to be evacuated from the quarantined cruise ship, and one member of the testing team from Japan's health ministry has tested positive for the disease, the ministry said. Companies are stepping up measures to prevent the spread of the virus as a growing number of cases have been reported in people who have neither visited China nor have had direct contact with people arriving from there. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp, one of Japan's biggest companies, said it was urging its roughly 200,000 group-wide employees to work from home or stagger their commutes. On Friday, NTT Data Corp said a contract employee who worked at one of its buildings was confirmed infected. The company has ordered 14 workers who were in close contact with that person to work at home, it said.

18 Feb 2020 09:36AM,More than 80% of COVID-19 patients have mild disease and recover: WHO chief,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners GENEVA: The new novel coronavirus only causes mild disease for 80 per cent of infected patients, said the World Health Organization on Monday (Feb 17). The COVID-19 virus death toll has surpassed 1,800 in China, where it has infected more than 70,500. Speaking to reporters, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that 14 per cent of patients would have severe diseases such as pneumonia. ""Around five percent of cases are considered critical with possible multi-organ failure, septic shock and respiratory failure and, in some cases, death,"" he added. Tedros also said there were ""relatively few cases"" among children and more research was needed to understand why. It ... appears that COVID-19 is not as deadly as other coronaviruses including SARS and MERS. WHO WARNS AGAINST ""BLANKET MEASURES"" The WHO chief also warned against ""blanket measures"" over the novel coronavirus outbreak, pointing out the epidemic outside of China was only affecting a ""tiny"" proportion of the population. WHO officials rejected the suggestion that all cruises should be halted to avoid risking a new nest of infection like the one on the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess off Japan. ""Measures should be taken proportional to the situation. Blanket measures may not help,"" Tedros stressed. The outbreak has battered manufacturing and tourism across the region and led to multiple travel restrictions including for flights and cruises. ""If we are going to disrupt every cruise ship in the world on the off chance that there might be some potential contact with some potential pathogen then where do we stop?"" said Michael Ryan, head of WHO's health emergencies programme. Ryan said that even at the epicentre of the crisis in the city of Wuhan in central Hubei Province, the ""attack rate"" - a measure of the speed of spread of the virus - was four per 100,000. ""This is a very serious outbreak and it has the potential to grow, but we need to balance that in terms of the number of people infected. Outside Hubei this epidemic is affecting a very, very tiny, tiny proportion of people,"" he said. Tedros also referred to an apparent decline in new cases of the disease in recent days but said that the trend ""must be interpreted very cautiously"". ""Trends can change as new populations are affected. It is too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table,"" he said.

18 Feb 2020 10:48PM,"Most COVID-19 infections are mild, says Chinese study","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: Most people infected by the new coronavirus in China have mild symptoms, with older patients and those with underlying conditions most at risk from the disease, according to a study by Chinese researchers. The disease has now killed nearly 1,900 people and infected more than 72,000 in China since it first emerged in the central city of Wuhan late last year. A paper published in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology looked at 72,314 confirmed, suspected, clinically diagnosed, and asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 illness across China as of Feb 11. It is the biggest study on novel coronavirus patients since the outbreak began in late December. Here are the main findings from the paper by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC): ELDERLY, SICK AT RISK About 80.9 per cent of infections are classified as mild, 13.8 per cent as severe and only 4.7 per cent as critical. The findings reinforce the statements made by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday that the coronavirus causes only mild disease for most patients. The highest fatality rate is for people aged 80 and older, at 14.8 per cent. The study finds that patients with cardiovascular disease are most likely to die of complications from the novel coronavirus, followed by patients with diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and hypertension. There were no deaths among children aged up to 9, despite at least two cases of newborn babies infected through their mothers. Up to age 39, the death rate remains low at 0.2 per cent. The fatality rate increases gradually with age. For people in their 40s it is 0.4 per cent, in their 50s it is 1.3 per cent, in their 60s it is 3.6 per cent and their 70s it is 8.0 per cent. Men are more likely to die (2.8 per cent) than women (1.7 per cent). The overall death rate from the virus stood at 2.3 per cent. While the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002-2003 affected fewer people, the fatality rate was nearly 10 per cent. The US Centres for Disease Control says between 26 million to 36 million Americans contracted seasonal flu between October 2019 and Feb 8 this year, and there were between 14,000 to 36,000 deaths - a fatality rate of around 0.1 per cent. 'WUHAN EXPOSURE' Nearly 86 per cent of those who have contracted the illness had either lived in or travelled to Wuhan, where a seafood market that illegally sold wild animals is believed to be the original source of the virus. The city in central China's Hubei province has been under lockdown since Jan 23. RISK TO MEDICAL WORKERS A total of 3,019 health workers have been diagnosed, 1,716 of whom were confirmed cases, and five had died as of Feb 11, the report said. An analysis of 1,688 severe cases among medical staff showed that 64 per cent of them were working in Wuhan. ""The percentage of severe cases among Wuhan medical staff has gradually decreased from 38.9 per cent at the peak (on Jan 28) to 12.7 per cent in early February,"" the report said. A hospital director in Wuhan died from the illness on Tuesday. Earlier this month Wuhan ophthalmologist Li Wenliang, who had been punished by authorities for sounding the alarm about the virus, also died. 'DOWNWARD TREND' The epidemic reached its ""first peak"" between Jan 24 and 26, the report said. It suggests there is has been a ""downward trend"" in the overall epidemic curve since Feb 11 - meaning the spread of the disease, especially outside Hubei province, was slowing. On Feb 13, China broadened its definition of confirmed cases to include those who were clinically diagnosed through lung imaging, in addition to those with a positive lab test result. The report hints that China's decision to lock down Wuhan - a city of 11 million people -- and impose strict transport curbs in other affected areas may have paid off. POSSIBLE REBOUND The virus spread as millions of people criss-crossed the country for the Chinese New Year holiday in late January. The authors warn that with many people returning from the holiday, the country needs to brace itself for a ""possible rebound of the epidemic"". Coronaviruses may continue to ""adapt over time and become more virulent"", the report warns and urges doctors to ""remain vigilant"".

18 Feb 2020 06:07AM,COVID-19 outbreak: What you need to know about the Public Health Preparedness Clinics,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: About 900 general practitioner (GP) clinics will be reactivated as Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) starting Tuesday (Feb 18), to care for patients with respiratory symptoms in light of the COVID-19 outbreak. The Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Friday that it expects the number of confirmed cases in Singapore to increase, partly due to the enhanced disease surveillance. ˚Ä˚We are quite concerned that many of the local confirmed cases have remained in the community and some have gone back to work even when they were ill and even after they have seen a doctor. This is not helpful in our efforts to reduce the risk of community transmission,˚Ä˚ Health Minister Gan Kim Yong had said on Friday. What makes these clinics different and where can you find them? Here˚Ä˚s what you need to know: WHAT ARE PHPCS The PHPCs are ˚Ä˚an important line of defence˚Ä˚ during public health outbreaks, Mr Gan had said. The activation of PHPCs and polyclinics would allow the virus to be detected in patients earlier and reduce the risk of further transmission, according to the Health Ministry. The PHPCs, which provide subsidised treatment and medication during public health outbreaks, were previously activated to deal with haze and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. The clinics are familiar with the appropriate care protocols according to the assessed risk and diagnosis of each patient, and will be supplied with the necessary personal protective equipment, said the ministry. From Tuesday, about 900 clinics will be ÅEÄÅEprogressively activatedÅEÄÅE to care for patients with respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat and runny nose. These clinics will also help refer pat"" to a hospital if they are suspected to have pneumonia.   WHERE ARE THE CLINICS? The clinics can be identified by a PHPC decal, and members of the public can find an updated list of PHPCs at https://www.flugowhere.gov.sg from Tuesday. GPs undergo a ÅEÄÅEprocess of enrolmentÅEÄÅE when they apply to join the PHPC scheme, said MOHÅEÄÅEs director of medical services Kenneth Mak on Friday. This includes teaching them the importance of infection control and training them to use personal protective equipment. ""ere is a little bit more work done in order to make sure they are better prepared to deal with patients that have infectious diseases,"" added Associate Professor Mak. ""It is not that ordinary GPs cannot manage such conditions, but these GPs (PHPCs) have been given additional training, additional preparation that they've done such that in times like this, we have a ready group of doctors and their clinics who are able to stand up and then further support as we then manage an outbreak in a crisis."" WHO SHOULD GO TO PHPCS Patients with respiratory symptoms, such as fever, cough, sore throat and runny nose should visit PHPCs. These clinics will provide special subsidies for those diagnosed with respiratory symptoms, to encourage those who are ill to seek treatment, said MOH. Patients with such symptoms can also go to polyclinics, where the subsidies will also apply.   Singapore citizens and permanent residents diagnosed with respiratory illnesses at the PHPCs and polyclinics will pay a flat subsidised rate of S$10 for their consultation and treatment. Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation seniors will pay S$5. The ministry also advised patients to return to the same doctor to seek further treatment if their symptoms persist or deteriorate. ""Patients must recognise the importance of staying home when unwell,"" it said in a media release on Friday. ""Mixing in large crowds, or continuing to go to work or school when ill, even with mild symptoms, will put others at risk."" WHY THE NEED FOR 5-DAYS MC In light of the COVID-19 outbreak, healthcare professionals have also been advised to provide medical certificates (MCs) of five days for patients with respiratory symptoms. Patients will be referred for further medical assessment and tests if they do not recover within five days, said the ministry. Most patients with respiratory symptoms are not infected with COVID-19, noted the health ministry, but extra precautions must be taken. MOH stressed that anyone with respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat and runny nose should seek medical treatment early and stay home throughout their illness. ""We urge all individuals and employers to cooperate and follow strictly the five-day MC regime that has been put in place."" Addressing the five-day period, Assoc Prof Mak explained on Friday that the majority of patients with respiratory problems will recover within three to four days. ""Most people with minor conditions would have recovered by then, and it (five days) allows us to look and determine whether there ",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-phpc-public-health-clinic-need-to-know-subsidies-where-12441664
15 Feb 2020 06:30AM,How wide the spread of COVID-19 might actually be,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners The mortality rate of the new coronavirus has been lower than SARS, but the nature of the virus suggests that it might be moving faster and further than efforts to contain it, the programme Insight discovers. SINGAPORE: For every person with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it seems that at least three or four others are going to be infected too. That is how contagious the new coronavirus is, and that is a ÅEÄÅEvery conservativeÅEÄÅE estimate, said Dr Asok Kurup, chairman of the Chapter of Infectious Disease Physicians, Academy of Medicine, Singapore. ÅEÄÅEThe numbers are likely to be much more expon""ÅEÄÅE The outbreak may seem similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2002-2003, but it is becoming apparent to infectious disease specialists like him and Dr Leong Hoe Nam how the new coronavirus is different. First, the evidence is that the fatality rate in China ÅEÄÅE 2.14 per cent ÅEÄÅE has been lower than that for SARS globally ÅEÄÅE 9.56 per cent ÅEÄÅE a point noted by Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong on Friday (Feb 14). But because of the ""ree of infection"", experts believe COVID-19 may spread at a much faster rate, ˚Ä˚(By) coming close or talking, you may spread the infection, not like SARS,˚Ä˚ said Dr Leong, who practises at Mount Elizabeth Novena Specialist Centre, on the programme Insight. WATCH: Just how contagious is COVID-19? (5:47)  In fact, COVID-19˚Ä˚s transmission mechanism is ˚Ä˚closer to H1N1 or influenza˚Ä˚ than SARS, said Mr Wong, co-chair of the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on COVID-19. ˚Ä˚Like influenza, (our researchers) have found that COVID-19 is infectious when the symptoms are mild. Because of this ˚Äf it˚Ä˚s also the case that COVID-19, like influenza, can spread quite quickly.˚Ä˚ This ease of spread means not only that the virus is harder to contain than SARS, but also that the current scale of contagion could be more serious than thought, the programme Insight finds out. (Watch the episode here.) ˚Ä˚UNPRECEDENTED SPREAD˚Ä˚ The SARS virus infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 worldwide over nine months, but the novel coronavirus has infected more than 63,000 people ˚Ä˚ with over 1,300 dead ˚Ä˚ in barely two months. The thing is, the incubation period ˚Ä˚ the time between exposure and the onset of symptoms ˚Ä˚ is typically two to seven days for SARS patients. And they are most likely to be contagious only when they have symptoms, such as fever or cough. ˚Ä˚Infection ˚Äf happens best in the second half of the illness, after the first seven days,˚Ä˚ said Dr Leong. But there have been suggestions that novel coronavirus could possibly be spread by asymptomatic individuals, that is, those who are not showing signs of being ill, both Dr Kurup and Dr Leong noted. If this is so, it means these people could be spreading the virus undetected, before the onset of illness. ˚Ä˚This allows the virus to propagate very quickly, across large swathes of area (with) many, many people. Hence we˚Ä˚re seeing these numbers ˚Äf of infections,˚Ä˚ said Dr Leong, who called it an ˚Ä˚unprecedented spread˚Ä˚. The patients whom doctors end up seeing and treating, however, are the sickest ˚Ä˚10, 20 per cent˚Ä˚, he reckons. The bulk who are asymptomatic or have minor symptoms that can be taken for, say, the common cold might be ÅEÄÅE(four) times more than (the patients) weÅEÄÅEre seeing nowÅEÄÅE, he warned.

19 Feb 2020 03:38AM,China's Hubei to adopt thorough checks on patients to curb COVID-19,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The central Chinese province of Hubei will adopt more thorough and forceful measures to find patients with fever to further help contain the new coronavirus epidemic, the state media reported on Tuesday (Feb 18). Hubei will check records of all fever patients who have visited doctors since Jan 20, and people who have bought over-the-counter cough and fever medications at both brick-and-mortar and online drug stores, Xinhua reported, citing a notice by the province's epidemic control headquarters. The people will get health check-ups and, if necessary, be put in quarantine or hospitalised, the report added, citing the notice. China reported on Tuesday its fewest COVID-19 infections since January and its lowest daily death toll for a week, but the World Health Organization said data suggesting the epidemic had slowed should still be viewed with caution. China said figures showing a slowdown in new cases in recent days show that aggressive steps it has taken to curb travel and commerce are slowing the spread of the disease beyond Hubei and the province's capital, Wuhan.

BEIJING: China˚Ä˚s COVID-19 outbreak has also sparked an epidemic of online panic. When SARS hit in 2003, 6 per cent of China˚Ä˚s population was online; now almost 60 per cent are. The average user of WeChat, the country˚Ä˚s dominant social media platform, spends 90 minutes a day on the app. As a result, while more than 40,000 patients in China are fighting the virus, the entire country is facing an onslaught of online media ˚Ä˚ much of it disinformation. COVID-19 ON SOCIAL MEDIA There are important upsides to the proliferation of social media in China. It enables citizen reporting of a kind rarely seen in the country ˚Ä˚ such as video blogs from Wuhan, the city at the heart of the epidemic. Such independent reporting is essential in China˚Ä˚s tightly state-controlled media environment. At the same time, however, the flow of information is bigger than ever. Receiving information straight to your phone, in real time, can make you feel like the virus is closing in on you ˚Ä˚ even if it˚Ä˚s not. Being surrounded by panic-inducing headlines, whether true or false, has its own impact on health. A recent study in the Lancet about the impact of the Hong Kong protests on mental health found that spending more than two hours a day following such events on social media was associated with an increased likelihood of post-traumatic stress and depression, although the direction of causality is unclear. REAL OR FAKE?   Amid the deluge of coronavirus news, some find it hard to distinguish between real and fake. Last week, my grandpa texted me on WeChat: ˚Ä˚Viruses are scared of acid. Twice a day ...˚Ä˚dab a cotton bud with strong vinegar and stick it inside your nose. It will help greatly with the current virus outbreak.˚Ä˚ I didn˚Ä˚t reach for the cotton buds. Friends told me they had received similar messages from relatives, asking them to dab sesame oil in their nostrils or avoid wearing wool. They often came via that most tricky of social arenas: the family group chat. Many messages, like my grandpa˚Ä˚s, were copy-and-paste rumours that looked at first glance like genuine texts. Many begin with conversational openings: ˚Ä˚A friend who works in a hospital told me˚Äf˚Ä˚ Others include a cry of urgency: ˚Ä˚I just got this message!˚Ä˚ Or: ˚Ä˚Important news.˚Ä˚ Such messages remind me of those that circulated ahead of last December˚Ä˚s UK election, after the Yorkshire Evening Post reported the story of a sick child forced to sleep on the floor of a hospital because of a lack of beds. Once the story broke, social media posts trying to discredit it proliferated, often opening with: ÅEÄÅEA friend who is a nurse told meÅEÄ¶ÅEÄÅE In response, James Mitchinson, editor of the Post, asked one critic: ÅEÄÅEWhy do you trust (this social media accountÅEÄÅEs) claim over the newspaper youÅEÄÅEve taken for years in good faith?ÅEÄÅE DISPELLING MISINFORMATION   In China, though, people are increasingly unsure whether they can take the media in good faith. There has been widespread anger at the government over its hushing up of virus cases in the early stages of the outbreak, and over the police punishment of the young whistle-blower doctor who had warned of a new strain of coronavirus, and who, tragically, died from it last week.

13 Feb 2020 06:48PM,"Amid fears of 80% revenue loss due to COVID-19 outbreak, restaurants hope for rent rebates","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Restaurant operators in Singapore are bracing for a significant hit on their revenue - with some expecting as much as an 80 per cent drop - over the next three months as tourists stay away and locals avoid public places amid the outbreak of a deadly novel coronavirus. To avoid ˚Ä˚a big collapse˚Ä˚ in the food and beverage (F&B) industry, the Restaurant Association of Singapore (RAS) said on Thursday (Feb 13) that it has written to 24 major shopping mall landlords requesting for a temporary cut in rent. ˚Ä˚Looking at the situation right now, we are hoping at least 50 per cent rental rebate for the first 3 months,˚Ä˚ said RAS president Vincent Tan Rent and wages typically make up for more than half of a restaurant˚Ä˚s operating cost here. Meanwhile, profitability of restauranteurs has been low at about 1.7 per cent even before the virus outbreak, said Mr Tan, who is also the managing director of food service provider Select Group. ˚Ä˚If your sales drop by 50 per cent and your margin is about 1.7 per cent, you just imagine how difficult we are at this moment,˚Ä˚ he told reporters. The industry group˚Ä˚s appeal to the landlords, including CapitaLand and Frasers Property, was sent out on Monday. Some landlords have responded, although none has committed to a rental rebate. ˚Ä˚So far, their response is towards wanting to understand this a little bit more and they want to speak to the individual tenants in more detail,˚Ä˚ said RAS executive director Edwin Fong. On the other hand, Jewel Changi Airport has reached out to its tenants with a 50 per cent rent rebate for February and March, Mr Tan told reporters, describing this as an ˚Ä˚impactful decision˚Ä˚ that will help restaurant operators to preserve jobs. Katrina Group˚Ä˚s CEO Alan Goh told CNA that its So Pho store at Jewel Changi Airport has seen an 80 per cent drop in business after authorities raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange last Friday. Describing the rent rebate as a helpful move, he said: ˚Ä˚We hope we can appeal to the rest of the landlords to take up Jewel˚Ä˚s initiative.˚Ä˚ Other restaurant operators at the press conference echoed that and appealed for landlords to partner them through this difficult period. RAS vice president Andrew Kwan pointed to how major shopping mall landlords in Hong Kong are offering cuts in February rent by as much as 60 per cent to help tenants ride out the effects of the coronavirus outbreak. If there is no reduction in rent for local restaurant operators, it is likely that some players may have to close down ˚Ä˚because it is not tenable to pay rent and wages while revenues are wiped out˚Ä˚, he added. Noting that landlords have a ˚Ä˚social responsibility to help (tenants) protect jobs˚Ä˚, RAS president advisor Andrew Tjioe said: ˚Ä˚You can see how most of our landlords are performing financially ˚Ä˚ there is an imbalance of the distribution of income. Many of us are operating in the REIT malls and rents over there are increasing year by year. It˚Ä˚s a very heavy burden for F&B operators.˚Ä˚ ˚Ä˚If we don˚Ä˚t survive, they too can˚Ä˚t survive,˚Ä˚ added Mr Tjioe, founder of the Tung Lok chain of restaurants. ˚Ä˚It˚Ä˚s better for us to work closely together.˚Ä˚ Apart from appealing to the landlords, the association said it has also been in constant dialogue with government agencies over the past two weeks. In a letter addressed to Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing on Monday, it said it is hoping for help in the form of a suspension in foreign worker levy, wage support in terms of covering half the employers˚ÄÅE CPF contribution, higher access to working capital loans, as well as rental subsidies in government-owned and managed properties.

As of Saturday, 72 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in Singapore, with the Government earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. As Singapore deals with these challenges, the authorities are doing their utmost to fight the outbreak, said Mr Heng in his remarks. ˚Ä˚While dealing with the immediate challenges, I want to assure Singaporeans that we are doing our best, mobilising our full resources across Government and society, to fight the outbreak and to better protect you,˚Ä˚ he said.  His remarks come after Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Friday warned the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak could have a significant impact on the local economy. Workers and firms are ˚Ä˚understandably concerned˚Ä˚ about the impact of the outbreak on the economy, said Mr Heng. ÅEÄÅESome sectors have been ""d hit, such as tourism and transport, and we have already taken targeted measures to support them.

The Government will also support firms and workers ÅEÄÅEto make the best use of this periodÅEÄÅE to carry out restructuring, training and upgrading, in order to ÅEÄÅEemerge stronger when the eventual upturn comesÅEÄÅE. Help will also be given to households concerned about the cost of living, he added. ÅEÄÅEIn this time of uncertainty, I know that households are more concerned about their expenses,ÅEÄÅE he said.

""With all these additional support measures, you have my assurance that we will rebound from this. Never fear."" TURN FEAR, ANXIETY INTO ˚Ä˚CONCRETE ACTION˚Ä˚ In addition to support for companies and workers, Singapore will also need to strengthen its ˚Ä˚social and psychological resilience˚Ä˚ in the fight against COVID-19, said the Deputy Prime Minister. Mr Heng called for people to ˚Ä˚turn our fears and anxieties into concrete action˚Ä˚ to tackle the outbreak, including looking after themselves and taking care of others. This means taking measures such as observing good personal hygiene, seeing a doctor and staying home if unwell and staying updated on the situation from credible sources. ˚Ä˚If you are well, carry on with normal life as far as possible,˚Ä˚ he said. After Singapore raised its DORSCON level to Orange, the country saw a surge in demand for groceries, with some stores reporting stock shortages. Authorities moved to assure Singaporeans that the country˚Ä˚s supply chain remains robust and that there was no need to rush for essential supplies. In his remarks on Sunday, Mr Heng urged people not to panic buy or spread rumours. ˚Ä˚We have enough supplies of food, and an adequate stockpile of masks and other essential items, if used responsibly,ÅEÄÅE he said. ÅEÄÅEWe are actively replenishing our supplies and stockpiles from a diverse range of sources.

18 Feb 2020 06:44AM,Apple to miss revenue forecast as iPhone supply hit by COVID-19,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SAN FRANCISCO: Apple announced on Monday (Feb 17) it would miss its March quarter revenue forecast and global iPhone supplies would fall because of the deadly coronavirus epidemic, triggering a fall in Asian stock markets. The COVID-19 death toll now exceeds 1,800 in China, where it has infected more than 72,000 after emerging in the central province of Hubei in December. The virus has sparked global economic jitters, with travel bans and mass quarantines inside China forcing factories to suspend operations and shops to close. Apple, which depends on components from Chinese suppliers and has a big market in China, has been hammered on both fronts. ""We are experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated,"" Apple said in a statement. ""As a result, we do not expect to meet the revenue guidance we provided for the March quarter."" Apple had forecast revenue of $63 billion to $67 billion for the second quarter to March. The US tech giant did not disclose how much it expected the outbreak to shave off its revenues. But it said that worldwide iPhone supply would be ""temporarily constrained"" as its manufacturing partners in China were only slowly ramping up work after being closed because of the travel restrictions. Consumer demand in the crucial Chinese market had also been dampened after all Apple stores were shut. ""Stores that are (now) open have been operating at reduced hours and with very low customer traffic,"" the company said. ""We are gradually reopening our retail stores and will continue to do so as steadily and safely as we can."" Apple analyst and Loup Ventures co-founder Gene Munster told Bloomberg that the company was feeling the hit from its dependence on Chinese consumers. ""This is the double-edged sword of being in China,"" he said. ""They're the only big (US tech) company with China exposure, so they are working through the pain of what has largely been a success for the company over the past decade."" Other Silicon Valley behemoths - such as Facebook, Amazon and Google parent company Alphabet - either have limited access to the market or are blocked outright by China's internet firewall. However supply chains of global firms such as Apple supplier Foxconn and auto giant Toyota have also been disrupted with production facilities in China temporarily closed. Sportswear giants Nike and Adidas also shuttered hundreds of stores in the country this month and warned of a negative impact on their earnings. STOCK MARKET CONTAGION Apple suppliers suffered in Tuesday trade after the forecast. Sony, which provides Apple with key imaging components, lost 2.5 percent, while electronic parts maker Murata Manufacturing plunged more than three percent on the Tokyo bourse. ""Traders were downhearted about Apple's announcement,"" Chibagin Asset Management's Yoshihiro Okumura told AFP. Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed down 1.4 per cent - its fourth straight session in the red, while Hong Kong's main market was down 1.3 per cent. Monday marked the second time in as many years that Apple cut earnings forecasts due to setbacks in the Chinese market. It followed a downgrade for the 2019-20 financial year due to a lag in iPhone sales, which the company blamed on the US-China trade war. International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva has said there could be a cut of up to 0.2 percentage points to global growth because of the virus. Outside of hardest-hit Hubei, which has been effectively locked down to try to contain the virus, the number of new cases has been slowing and China's national health authority has said the outbreak is under control. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the trend ""must be interpreted very cautiously"". Further moves by China's central bank on Monday to cushion the world's second-largest economy against the health crisis appear to have done little to allay concerns. State media said China may postpone its annual parliamentary session, which has been held in March for the past 35 years.

In the announcement published on its website, SIA provided a link to the list of flights that will be affected by the decision. Key affected destinations include Frankfurt, Jakarta, London, Los Angeles, Mumbai, Paris, Seoul, Sydney and Tokyo, the airline said. ""Singapore Airlines and SilkAir will temporarily reduce services across our network due to weak demand as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak,"" the carrier said. ""We will continue to monitor the situation and make further adjustments as necessary."" The airline added that affected customers will be ""notified and re-accommodated onto other flights. ""If you have booked your tickets through a travel agency, please contact your agent for assistance. If you have booked your tickets directly with Singapore Airlines, please contact the SIA reservations team at (+65) 6223-8888 if you need any assistance,"" the airline said. The cuts follow major reductions already announced in services to mainland China and Hong Kong. In the Dec quarter, flights to mainland China made up 11 per cent of capacity for the airline, and more than that for budget arm Scoot. ""It's not a surprise to see some cuts in flights, given the weak forward bookings that can be expected from the current environment,"" said DBS analyst Paul Yong. Demand on flights to South Korea and Japan had been hit hardest after China, Yong quoted Singapore Airlines' management team as having told analysts at a results briefing on Monday. Those were the areas of the biggest cutbacks in Tuesday's announcement. Singapore's tally of 77 cases of the virus is one of the highest outside mainland China, where more than 1,800 people have been killed in the epidemic. Last week, the Asian tourism and travel hub said it expected visitor numbers to drop by a quarter or more this year, hit by the virus outbreak. Besides visitors to the city-state, Singapore Airlines also relies heavily on transit traffic. Premium travel has suffered after many business events were cancelled across Asia because of the virus. Hong Kong-based rival Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd has said it is cutting 40 per cent of capacity across its network, up from 30 per cent earlier, due to weak demand.

16 Feb 2020 06:01AM,"Cruise liners steer clear of mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore over COVID-19 fears","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Instances of cruise ships being stuck at sea have prompted enhanced measures, including maintaining a clean environment and conducting health checks for those on board. SINGAPORE: Major cruise liners have changed their itineraries in Asia to avoid calling at major ports like Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore amid fears of COVID-19. Concurrently, they have imposed restrictions on passengers and stepped up health checks as well as cleaning protocols to assuage fears. When asked by CNA, British-American cruise line Cunard said that one of its ships, the Queen Mary 2, will skip a scheduled stop in Singapore this month. Passengers who were due to embark in Singapore will have the option of joining them from Freemantle, Australia and set sail on an Australian itinerary. Royal Caribbean and Celebrity Cruises have also reportedly cancelled sailings to Singapore in the coming weeks. As of Saturday (Feb 15), Singapore reported more than 70 confirmed cases for COVID-19. Earlier, the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level was raised to Orange from Yellow. Additionally, for Regent Seven Seas Cruises, its ship the Seven Seas Voyager has removed Hong Kong from its Feb 12, Mar 1 and Mar 13 voyages. Meanwhile, Princess Cruise Line has also modified the itinerary for at least two of its ships ˚Ä˚ the Sapphire Princess and Sun Princess. For the Sapphire Princess, its voyages departing on Apr 16, May 2 and May 18 will arrive in Tokyo instead of Shanghai. As for the Sun Princess, its scheduled calls to Hong Kong on Apr 28 and Jul 14, and Shanghai on May 1 and Jul 17, have been cancelled and replaced with calls to Seoul and Jeju in South Korea. Mainland China, where the outbreak is said to have originated, has reported more than 1,500 deaths and over 65,000 infections.   Concerns over COVID-19 have been amplified by how one of Princess Cruise Line˚Ä˚s ship, the Diamond Princess, has become the largest single cluster of cases outside China. The ship has been quarantined in the Japanese port of Yokohama and its 3,600 passengers and crew have been stuck at sea. More than 200 people who were on board have been tested positive for the virus and they have been transferred to a local health facility for treatment. Moreover, another cruise ship MS Westerdam carrying 1,455 passengers and 802 crew members was finally permitted to dock at the Cambodian port city of Sihanoukville after it spent the last two weeks at sea having been turned away by five counties over fears of the coronavirus.   These recent developments have prompted more measures by cruise liners to avoid an outbreak on board as this can lead to bad publicity and hurt them financially, said infectious diseases specialist Professor Sanjaya Senanayake. ÅEÄÅEThereÅEÄÅEs a lot of incentive for cruises to look after and maintain a clean environment. We know that more than 20 million people in the world travel on cruises in a year and a lot of them have a wonderful time,ÅEÄÅE said Prof Senanayake, who is with the Australian National University. RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED ON PASSENGERS Beside making itinerary changes, cruises liners are restricting some passengers, based on their nationality and recent travel history.   Regent Seven Seas Cruise said that guests who hold a Chinese, Hong Kong or Macau passport, regardless of where they reside, will not be allowed to board its ships until Apr 8. Meanwhile, Cunard and Princess Cruises said that any passenger who has travelled through China, Macau or Hong Kong within 14 days of the start of the cruise will not be permitted to board the vessel. As a further precautionary measure, Cunard said any passenger who has travelled fr""hrough Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Singapore or Malaysia within 14 days of embarkation will be subject to enhanced pre-boarding screening to determine whether permission is given to embark. ENHANCED DISINFECTION PROTOCOLS Cruise lines have also intensified environmental disinfection on board, in addition to existing cleaning and sanitation protocols. For Princess Cruises, a spokesperson told CNA that its ships and medical staff are well equipped to prevent and contain the spread of contagiousÅEÄØillnesses, includingÅEÄØcoronavirus. ÅEÄÅEWe are taking extra precautions andÅEÄØare beingÅEÄØguidedÅEÄØin consultation withÅEÄØinternational and localÅEÄØhealthÅEÄØauthorities,ÅEÄÅE the spokesperson""g the precautions that are being taken include enhanced screeningÅEÄØofÅEÄØguestsÅEÄØand crew, as well as temperature checks for those with fever or respiratory symptoms. When a passenger exhibits symptoms of the virus while onboard, Regent Seven Seas Cruises said they could be screened for the coronavirus and may be subjected to potential quarantine and disembarkation. For passengers who were on board the Diamond Princess that have been under quarantine, Princess Cruise Line said that its guests will ""eive a full refund of cruise expenses"" considering the ""extraordinary circumstances"". These expenses include cruise fares, hotels expenses before and after the cruise and air transfers. Passengers will also receive a 100 per cent future cruise credit equal to the fare they paid for the voyage, redeemable before Feb 28. CRUISE TERMINALS SHUT, SCREENING MEASURES ENHANCED Some cruise terminals have been shut for now, while others have stepped up screening measures.   Hong Kong has closed off its two cruise terminals: Kai Tak and Ocean. Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam made the announcement as part of measures to suspend 10 out of 13 border crossings with mainland China, in a bid to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Ms Lam said the closures would reduce the number of Chinese mainlanders entering Hong Kong and allow officials to focus resources on two land entry points as well as the airport. Over at MalaysiaÅEÄÅEs Boustead Cruise Centre in Port Klang, thermal scanners have been installed and authorities would check passenger manifests before allowing cruise passengers to disembark.   During a visit to the cruise centre on Thursday, MalaysiaÅEÄÅEs Transport Minister Anthony Loke said the cruise centre would not allow",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/coronavirus-covid-19-cruise-liners-avoid-asia-12435530

Council chairman Mr S Manogaran said that the decision to postpone the festival - originally scheduled to be held from Apr 4 to May 3 - was not easy. ˚Ä˚However, many of our festival programmes are meant for students and families. Their safety and well-being, as well as that of our partners is our priority. ˚Ä˚As such, we have decided to postpone the Festival, which is in line with the Ministry of Health˚Ä˚s (MOH) advisory to cancel or defer large-scale events in view of the COVID-19 situation,˚Ä˚ he said. Mr Manogaran added that he would like to thank the festival˚Ä˚s funding, programme and venue partners, as well as the community for their understanding and support. He said that the council will continue to monitor the situation as well as work closely with supporting agencies and community partners. Three new COVID-19 cases were confirmed on Sunday, bringing Singapore˚Ä˚s total number of cases to 75. Following several cases of COVID-19 without any links to previous cases or travel history to mainland China, Singapore on Feb 7 raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange from Yellow.

Hubei will check records of all fever patients who have visited doctors since Jan 20, and people who have bought over-the-counter cough and fever medications at both brick-and-mortar and online drug stores, Xinhua reported, citing a notice by the province's epidemic control headquarters. The people will get health check-ups and, if necessary, be put in quarantine or hospitalised, the report added, citing the notice. China reported on Tuesday its fewest COVID-19 infections since January and its lowest daily death toll for a week, but the World Health Organization said data suggesting the epidemic had slowed should still be viewed with caution. China said figures showing a slowdown in new cases in recent days show that aggressive steps it has taken to curb travel and commerce are slowing the spread of the disease beyond Hubei and the province's capital, Wuhan.

Nearly 72,500 people nationwide have been infected by the new COVID-19 strain of the virus, which first emerged in December before spiralling into a nationwide epidemic. There were 1,886 new cases reported Tuesday - a decline on Monday's figure, and the lowest single-day figure of new cases so far this month. Most of the deaths were in Hubei province, the hard-hit epicentre of the outbreak, with five reported elsewhere in the country. Hubei has been locked down to try to contain the virus, with tens of millions of people placed under effective quarantine in the province. The number of new cases reported outside Hubei province was just 79, down from 890 on Feb 4. It marks the lowest number of new cases outside the virus-struck province since Jan 23. China's national health authority has said the declining numbers are a sign that the outbreak is under control. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the trend ""must be interpreted very cautiously"". ""Trends can change as new populations are affected. It is too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table,"" he told reporters on Monday. Chinese health officials have urged patients who recovered from the coronavirus to donate blood so that plasma can be extracted to treat others who are critically ill. Plasma from patients who have recovered from a spell of pneumonia triggered by COVID-19 contains antibodies that can help reduce the virus load in critically ill patients, an official from the National Health Commission told a press briefing Monday. More than 12,000 people have recovered and been discharged, according to health commission figures.

13 Feb 2020 03:35AM,Spain's World Mobile Congress cancelled over COVID-19 fears,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners MADRID: Organisers of the World Mobile Congress said on Wednesday (Feb 12) they have cancelled the world's top mobile trade fair due to fears stemming from the coronavirus, following an exodus of industry heavyweights. The mobile fair is one of the biggest events worldwide to be cancelled so far owing to the virus that has killed more than 1,100 people to date. The announcement came after the GSMA, the mobile trade association that organises the annual show, held a meeting to decide the fate of the event that had been planned to run in Barcelona from Feb 24-27. ""The GSMA has cancelled MWC Barcelona 2020 because the global concern regarding the coronavirus outbreak, travel concern and other circumstances, make it impossible for the GSMA to hold the event,"" a statement said. It said the decision was made with ""due regard to the safe and healthy environment in Barcelona and the host country,"" adding that host city parties understood the cancellation. Just hours before the meeting took place, Vodafone, Nokia, Deutsche Telekom, Britain's BT and Rakuten of Japan had pulled out, following in the footsteps of Intel, Facebook, Cisco and China's Vivo. A source close to the event had said that organisers were wary of being left with a cancellation bill of about 100 million euros (US$110 million). They faced resistance from authorities about declaring a health emergency in Spain which would allow insurance to cover the costs. So far, Spain has only registered two confirmed cases of infection. The annual Barcelona-based congress normally draws more than 100,000 people, including between 5,000 and 6,000 participants from China, organisers say. But this year, participation has been hit by the viral outbreak which has infected around 44,600 people. 'FINISH US OFF' The decision is certain to be a major blow for Barcelona, as the huge trade show was forecast to bring in almost 500 million euros, organisers said. ""It's the high point of the year,"" said Ignacio Arias, manager of the AC Som Marriott hotel which lies very close to the venue where the conference has been held since 2006. ""During the four days of the congress, the hotel is fully occupied with the highest rates of the year. There's no other week like it,"" he said, with his words echoed by fellow hoteliers. ""We were supposed to host the team assembling Sony's stand but they haven't turned up. Ericsson has cancelled 30 rooms, and Intel and LG have cancelled their meeting rooms,"" said the manager of another nearly hotel who did not want to give her name. ""It feels like we've been working for months for nothing. This year has been pretty sluggish so far and this is just going to finish us off."" Ride-sharing firms were also on edge. ""This period accounts for 20 per cent of our yearly income,"" said Jose Maria Goni who runs Unauto, a fleet of vehicles for hire with drivers. TRICKLE TO A DELUGE The cancellations began on Feb 4 when South Korea's LG Electronics, which occupies one of the largest spaces at the show, said it was pulling out to ""remove the risk of exposing hundreds of LG employees to international travel ... as the virus continues to spread across borders"". At that point, just under 500 people had died after contracting the virus. China's top smartphone manufacturer Huawei as well as its smaller rival ZTE, said their plans were unchanged, but pledged executives and staff would undergo a self-imposed two-week quarantine period, while ZTE said its stand and equipment would be disinfected daily. The organisers also sought to reassure exhibitors, saying they would step up security measures, impose restrictions on visitors from China and have staff on hand to take visitors' temperatures. But it wasn't enough, and the trickle of withdrawals quickly turned into a deluge with dozens of companies pulling out of the show.

The new infections were overwhelmingly in Hubei. Outside the epicentre, there were only 56 new cases reported, falling for the 15th day in a row.   A study released by Chinese officials said most patients have mild cases of the illness, and health officials have described the slowing numbers as an indication that the outbreak is under control.

17 Feb 2020 05:34PM,"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  Singapore reported two new COVID-19 cases on Monday, bringing its total to 77 confirmed cases. In all, 24 patients have fully recovered and been discharged from hospital, while 53 remain in hospital. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. ""The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added. The Government said it will continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order ""need to be separated from other people within the home"", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice ""common sense"" good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take ""some precautions"". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Officers will do surprise checks, and use technology, such as video calls to monitor people served the notice, Mr Wong said. As in the case of quarantine orders, eligible employers of those under the SHN can apply to MOM for a S$100 daily allowance. Affected self-employed citizens and PRs under the notice can apply for the S$100 daily allowance as well. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

The majority of these calls, within the timeframe of about a month, were made by members of the public, while some came from general practitioners and polyclinics. Also announced on Wednesday: All SCDF ambulance crew will now don full personal protective equipment (PPE) while attending to all cases. While ambulance crew were already donning PPE when dealing with suspected COVD-19 cases prior to Singapore˚Ä˚s risk assessment being raised DORSCON Orange, these new guidelines now apply to all medical cases, said SCDF.

The public should not be alarmed, they will be wearing PPE when responding to all calls, not just responding to a suspect novel coronavirus (case).˚Ä˚ Currently, the SCDF operations centre triages cases, with operators checking whether callers display possible symptoms as well as have a travel history to China. If they suspect a COVID-19 case, this particular information will be conveyed to the ambulance crew. Members of the ambulance crew will then make a phone call to the suspected case to further confirm this information. After conveying the suspect case to the hospital, a device will be used to decontaminate the ambulance - with the process lasting about 20 minutes while the crew removes and disposes their PPE.   ÅEÄÅEWe have been preparing for this situation, we have got people on standby, we are managing quite OK,ÅEÄÅE added Mr Amrin, when asked about how the SCDF has coped so far. Singapore reported two more confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus on Tuesday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) had said in a daily update. One had worked at the same location as another Bangladeshi coronavirus patient, the other is a Singapore permanent resident who lives in Johor Bahru and works at Resorts World Sentosa Casino. This brings the number of cases in Singapore to 47, with seven in critical condition. Two more patients - cases 17 and 36 - were discharged from hospital on Tue",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wuhan-virus-219-covid-19-suspected-cases-ambulance-scdf-12426652

As of Saturday, 72 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in Singapore, with the Government earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. As Singapore deals with these challenges, the authorities are doing their utmost to fight the outbreak, said Mr Heng in his remarks. ˚Ä˚While dealing with the immediate challenges, I want to assure Singaporeans that we are doing our best, mobilising our full resources across Government and society, to fight the outbreak and to better protect you,˚Ä˚ he said.  His remarks come after Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Friday warned the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak could have a significant impact on the local economy. Workers and firms are ˚Ä˚understandably concerned˚Ä˚ about the impact of the outbreak on the economy, said Mr Heng. ÅEÄÅESome sectors have been ""d hit, such as tourism and transport, and we have already taken targeted measures to support them. But we can expect to see a broader impact on the economy,ÅEÄÅE said Mr Heng. ÅEÄÅEAs confidence is affected, businesses and consumers could cut back on spending,ÅEÄÅE he said. ÅEÄÅEThe disruption to the global supply chain ÅEÄÅE a result of the interruptions to production in China ÅEÄÅE will also affect trade and manufacturing. Our workers and firms are understandably concerned.ÅEÄÅE As such, Mr Heng ÅEÄÅE who is also Finance Minister ÅEÄÅE touched on a set of ÅEÄÅEbroad-based measuresÅEÄÅE to be announced as part of Budget 2020 to support companies, workers and households. ÅEÄÅEOn Budget Day on Tuesday, I will set out a set of broad-based measures to support viable companies and help workers stay in their jobs,""providing wage support to ÅEÄÅEhelp companies preserve jobs for local workersÅEÄÅE, as well as tax rebates and rental waivers to help firms with their cash flow. More support will also be given to sectors that have been harder hit by the outbreak, including food and beverage and retail sectors, said Mr Heng. The Government will also support firms and workers ÅEÄÅEto make the best use of this periodÅEÄÅE to carry out restructuring, training and upgrading, in order to ÅEÄÅEemerge stronger when the eventual upturn comesÅEÄÅE. Help will also be given to households concerned about the cost of living, he added. ÅEÄÅEIn this time of uncertainty, I know that households are more concerned about their expenses,ÅEÄÅE he said. ÅEÄÅESo I will introduce a package to help households with their cost of living.ÅEÄÅE   He reiterated that the Government would do ÅEÄÅEall that is necessaryÅEÄÅE to help those affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.

""I assure you as Finance Minister that this Government will do all that is necessary to get workers and companies hit hard by this global health crisis back on their feet. ""With all these additional support measures, you have my assurance that we will rebound from this. Never fear."" TURN FEAR, ANXIETY INTO ˚Ä˚CONCRETE ACTION˚Ä˚ In addition to support for companies and workers, Singapore will also need to strengthen its ˚Ä˚social and psychological resilience˚Ä˚ in the fight against COVID-19, said the Deputy Prime Minister. Mr Heng called for people to ˚Ä˚turn our fears and anxieties into concrete action˚Ä˚ to tackle the outbreak, including looking after themselves and taking care of others. This means taking measures such as observing good personal hygiene, seeing a doctor and staying home if unwell and staying updated on the situation from credible sources. ˚Ä˚If you are well, carry on with normal life as far as possible,˚Ä˚ he said. After Singapore raised its DORSCON level to Orange, the country saw a surge in demand for groceries, with some stores reporting stock shortages. Authorities moved to assure Singaporeans that the country˚Ä˚s supply chain remains robust and that there was no need to rush for essential supplies. In his remarks on Sunday, Mr Heng urged people not to panic buy or spread rumours. ˚Ä˚We have enough supplies of food, and an adequate stockpile of masks and other essential items, if used responsibly,ÅEÄÅE he said. ÅEÄÅEWe are actively replenishing our supplies and stockpiles from a diverse range of sources.

13 Feb 2020 06:48PM,"Amid fears of 80% revenue loss due to COVID-19 outbreak, restaurants hope for rent rebates","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Restaurant operators in Singapore are bracing for a significant hit on their revenue - with some expecting as much as an 80 per cent drop - over the next three months as tourists stay away and locals avoid public places amid the outbreak of a deadly novel coronavirus. To avoid ˚Ä˚a big collapse˚Ä˚ in the food and beverage (F&B) industry, the Restaurant Association of Singapore (RAS) said on Thursday (Feb 13) that it has written to 24 major shopping mall landlords requesting for a temporary cut in rent. ˚Ä˚Looking at the situation right now, we are hoping at least 50 per cent rental rebate for the first 3 months,˚Ä˚ said RAS president Vincent Tan Rent and wages typically make up for more than half of a restaurant˚Ä˚s operating cost here. Meanwhile, profitability of restauranteurs has been low at about 1.7 per cent even before the virus outbreak, said Mr Tan, who is also the managing director of food service provider Select Group. ˚Ä˚If your sales drop by 50 per cent and your margin is about 1.7 per cent, you just imagine how difficult we are at this moment,˚Ä˚ he told reporters. The industry group˚Ä˚s appeal to the landlords, including CapitaLand and Frasers Property, was sent out on Monday. Some landlords have responded, although none has committed to a rental rebate. ˚Ä˚So far, their response is towards wanting to understand this a little bit more and they want to speak to the individual tenants in more detail,˚Ä˚ said RAS executive director Edwin Fong. On the other hand, Jewel Changi Airport has reached out to its tenants with a 50 per cent rent rebate for February and March, Mr Tan told reporters, describing this as an ˚Ä˚impactful decision˚Ä˚ that will help restaurant operators to preserve jobs. Katrina Group˚Ä˚s CEO Alan Goh told CNA that its So Pho store at Jewel Changi Airport has seen an 80 per cent drop in business after authorities raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange last Friday. Describing the rent rebate as a helpful move, he said: ˚Ä˚We hope we can appeal to the rest of the landlords to take up Jewel˚Ä˚s initiative.˚Ä˚ Other restaurant operators at the press conference echoed that and appealed for landlords to partner them through this difficult period. RAS vice president Andrew Kwan pointed to how major shopping mall landlords in Hong Kong are offering cuts in February rent by as much as 60 per cent to help tenants ride out the effects of the coronavirus outbreak. If there is no reduction in rent for local restaurant operators, it is likely that some players may have to close down ˚Ä˚because it is not tenable to pay rent and wages while revenues are wiped out˚Ä˚, he added. Noting that landlords have a ˚Ä˚social responsibility to help (tenants) protect jobs˚Ä˚, RAS president advisor Andrew Tjioe said: ˚Ä˚You can see how most of our landlords are performing financially ˚Ä˚ there is an imbalance of the distribution of income. Many of us are operating in the REIT malls and rents over there are increasing year by year. It˚Ä˚s a very heavy burden for F&B operators.˚Ä˚ ˚Ä˚If we don˚Ä˚t survive, they too can˚Ä˚t survive,˚Ä˚ added Mr Tjioe, founder of the Tung Lok chain of restaurants. ˚Ä˚It˚Ä˚s better for us to work closely together.˚Ä˚ Apart from appealing to the landlords, the association said it has also been in constant dialogue with government agencies over the past two weeks. In a letter addressed to Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing on Monday, it said it is hoping for help in the form of a suspension in foreign worker levy, wage support in terms of covering half the employers˚ÄÅE CPF contribution, higher access to working capital loans, as well as rental subsidies in government-owned and managed properties.

17 Feb 2020 12:44AM,Americans leave quarantined cruise ship in Japan as COVID-19 cases hit 355,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners YOKOHAMA, Japan: Americans began leaving a quarantined cruise ship off Japan on Monday (Feb 17) to board chartered flights home as the number of new coronavirus cases diagnosed on the vessel jumped to 355. The evacuation came as Japanese authorities stepped up warnings over the deadly outbreak, urging citizens to avoid crowds and ""non-essential gatherings."" The Diamond Princess was placed in a 14-day quarantine in early February after a former passenger tested positive for the virus. But US authorities announced on Saturday they would offer Americans on board the option to leave the ship and fly home, where they will face another 14-day isolation period. Several other governments have announced plans to remove their citizens from the ship as well. Late Sunday and into the early hours of Monday, Americans who opted to leave were brought off the ship in groups, passing through a makeshift passport control but undergoing no health checks, American passenger Sarah Arana told AFP. They boarded buses driven by personnel in head-to-toe protective suits and were told that the more than a dozen vehicles would travel in a convoy.   ""I am happy and ready to go,"" Arana told AFP before leaving the ship. ""We need a proper quarantine, this was not it."" The US government should have intervened ""much sooner, at the beginning,"" the 52-year-old medical social worker said. ""This was too much for Japan, and they shouldn't have had to bear the burden,"" she added. ""The people of Japan did not deserve this. I am full of gratitude."" DECLINING TO LEAVE But other Americans on board declined the evacuation, despite being warned they will still have to wait two weeks and test negative for the virus before being allowed back to the United States. ""My health is fine. And my two-week quarantine is almost over. Why would I want to be put on a bus and a plane with other people they think may be infected when I have spent nearly two weeks isolated from those people?"" tweeted Matt Smith, an American lawyer on the ship with his wife. He described a fellow American passenger standing on her balcony chanting ""USA, USA"" as buses arrived to collect them. ""Of course, in contravention of the rules of quarantine, she's not wearing a face mask, and she's talking with a passenger on the adjacent balcony ... And you wanted me to get on a bus with her?"" Earlier on Sunday, Japan's Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said 1,219 people on the ship had now been tested for the virus, with 355 diagnosed with the illness. Japan has not been able to test all those on board due to limited supplies of testing kits, facilities and manpower, which are also needed by authorities tracking the spread of the virus on land. But the health ministry said on Saturday that passengers older than 70 are being examined and those testing negative and in good health will be allowed to leave the ship from Wednesday. Tests on younger passengers were expected to start on Sunday and healthy people will be allowed to disembark after Wednesday, it said. 'A NEW PHASE' Other governments announced though that they too would seek to repatriate their nationals, with Hong Kong announcing plans to charter a flight for 330 city residents on the ship. Canada announced a similar decision, while Australia and Taiwan are considering such a move, local media said. In Japan, the number of new infections has continued to rise, with six new cases reported on Sunday, most of them in Tokyo. At least 59 cases have now been confirmed, including more than a dozen among the hundreds of Japanese nationals and their relatives repatriated from Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the outbreak. A fifth evacuation flight left to China on Sunday night. With the rise in local infections, Kato warned the country was ""entering a new phase."" ""We are seeing infection cases that we are unable to trace back their transmission routes,"" he told reporters. ""We want to ask the public to avoid non-urgent, non-essential gatherings. We want elderly and those with pre-existing conditions to avoid crowded places,"" he added. ""I think it's important that we exercise Japan's collective strength.""

13 Feb 2020 08:30AM,"Hubei reports nearly 15,000 new COVID-19 cases with new method of diagnosis","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: China's Hubei province on Thursday (Feb 13) reported a sharp rise in confirmed coronavirus cases and a surge in the death toll after the adoption of new methodology for diagnosis, health officials said. The death toll leapt by a record 242, more than double the prior provincial daily record of 103 set on Monday, , while the number of new cases soared by 14,840 - also a daily record - to a total of 48,206 cases in Hubei. Health officials in the province, the epicentre of the epidemic, said they had started including people diagnosed using the new methods from Thursday. Excluding cases confirmed using the new methods, the number of new cases rose by only 1,508, the official data showed. The provincial health commission said last week that it would begin recognising computerised tomography (CT) scan results as confirmation of infections, allowing hospitals to isolate patients more quickly. It also said it had revised its old data and previous assessments of suspected cases.  Hubei health commission said the change would mean patients could get treatment ""as early as possible"" and be ""consistent"" with the classification used in other provinces. It said it had made the change ""as our understanding of pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus deepens, and as we accumulate experience in diagnosis and treatment"".  In a update on Wednesday afternoon, the toll across China went up by 254 from the previous day to reach 1,367 deaths, with 15,152 new infections bringing the total to 59,805.   Experts questioned the change, with Victor Shih, a specialist in Chinese politics at the School of Global Policy & Strategy at UC San Diego, saying the sudden jump in new cases raises questions about China's commitment to transparency. ""The adjustment of the data today proved without doubt that they have had two sets of numbers for confirmed infected all along,"" he said. ""If that were not the case, the government could not have added so many new cases in one day. ""A very disturbing aspect of todayÅEÄÅEs new numbers is that the vast majority of new cases accrued to Wuhan, but what if the rest of Hubei province still did not adjust their reporting methods?"" Hubei had previously only allowed infection to be confirmed by RNA tests, which can take days to process and delay treatment. RNA, or ribonucleic acid, carries genetic information allowing for identification of organisms like viruses. Using CT scans that reveal lung infection would help patients receive treatment as soon as possible and improve their chances of recovery, the commission said. It could also lead to a spike in the death toll, according to Raina McIntyre, head of biosecurity research at the Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. ""Presumably, there are deaths which occurred in people who did not have a lab diagnosis but did have a CT. It is important that these also be counted,"" she told Reuters. She said the numbers could all be revised retrospectively from December, and it now depended on whether the more severely ill patients were confirmed by lab diagnoses and therefore included in the original numbers. If many of them were diagnosed using the newly included CT method and only now added to the total number of cases, then the death rate could rise. ""I think the new category 'positive test' (which is different from 'confirmed case') is more likely to reflect asymptomatic cases. Ideally these should be reported too, or we do not get a complete picture,"" said McIntyre. A shortage of RNA test kits in Hubei's capital Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated, has been a problem and may have delayed patients from being properly diagnosed and treated, contributing to the spread of the virus in the early days of the outbreak. China has placed around 56 million people in virtual quarantine in Hubei since late last month and restricted movements of millions more in cities far from the epicentre in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus.

Among the measures being taken is an increase in the number of hand sanitisers from 160 bottles to more than 1,200 bottles. They have been placed at high-traffic locations, such as check-in rows, departure and arrival immigration areas, as well as food and retail outlets. CAG has also doubled the frequency in cleaning and disinfecting high-contact areas. Disinfectants are used instead of general purpose cleaning solutions for the cleaning of surfaces including floors, countertops, railings and door handles. For frequently touched surfaces such as the the touchscreens of automated check-in kiosks and lift buttons, CAG has started to use a protective disinfectant coating that prevents viruses and bacteria from remaining on these surfaces. ""With a single application sprayed onto surfaces, the compound used reduces the chance of viruses and bacteria staying on them,"" CAG said. Approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as safe and eco-friendly, each application of the disinfectant - quaternary ammonium chloride - lasts between three and six months.   CAG is also using ÅEÄÅEozone-infused waterÅEÄÅE to disinfect toilet bowls and urinals as well as the floors of its restrooms. ÅEÄÅECompared to chlorine, the most liquid disinfection chemical, ozone is a much stronger and faster disinfectant,ÅEÄÅE CAG said.

18 Feb 2020 06:22AM,"Commentary: Disruptive tech is coming for COVID-19 threat, but needs more funding","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Artificial intelligence has shown a potential to be a game-changer this coronavirus outbreak. We must double-down on such investments, says Jonathan Chang. SINGAPORE: There isn˚Ä˚t a conversation going around these days that doesn't touch on the subject of COVID-19 ˚Ä˚ and the virus spreading to dozens of countries around the world. People are in fear, rightly so. People are worried for their own safety and their loved ones. Healthcare workers and policymakers are figuring out the best ways to contain the virus while the public does what it can. Non-profit and grassroots organisations come together offering assistance. Grab recently piloted a programme that provides round-the-clock rides to healthcare workers, a show of camaraderie on the part of drivers in this trying time for Singapore. In my recent Grab rides, drivers are offering the use of hand sanitisers for free, even though one driver told me he paid a fortune for a bottle.   HOW ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CAN HELP WITH EARLY WARNING AND DETECTION A larger question that some people have pondered is whether a technology solution could have detected and prevented a large-scale spread of a contagious disease like COVID-19. There is precedence. A Canadian start-up called BlueDot used its proprietary artificial intelligence technology and natural language processing to canvas a vast amount of information to look for signs and predict where an infectious disease will turn up next. BlueDot scoured through 100,000 news reports in 65 languages on a daily basis. The result: BlueDot sent an alert to its clients to avoid Wuhan on Dec 31, 2019, two weeks before the official announcement from the World Health Organization on Jan 9. Using global airline ticketing data, it also predicted that the virus would spread to Seoul, Bangkok, Taipei and Tokyo primarily. BlueDot is not without a track record, it had also successfully predicted the SARS pandemic. This is certainly an interesting usage of artificial intelligence and machine learning beyond the standard tools employed by e-commerce and social media to throw up shopping recommendations or provide better search results capabilities. The question is how to have this information readily available to the public and relevant organisations. There is a similar early warning tool Ushahidi developed in Kenya by a non-profit organization headquartered in Nairobi. Ushahidi uses crowdsourcing for social activism and public accountability, combining citizen journalism and geospatial information. Ushahidi allows people to submit reports through SMS, apps, social media and the Internet, creating a temporal and geospatial archive of events. The Ushahidi platform is often used for crisis response, human rights reporting and election monitoring. In Singapore, AI has also been enlisted to aid with detection. AI-powered temperature screening equipment piloted at Serangoon North and St Andrew˚Ä˚s Community Hospital in Simei does away with the need for manual screening, often time-consuming and manpower-intensive, and can detect and alert staff to individuals with high temperatures even if they were wearing spectacles or headgear.   RESEARCH INSTITUTES ARE ALSO PART OF THIS ECOSYSTEM John Hopkins University is the leading institution leveraging the geographic information system (GIS) technology ˚Ä˚ this is a system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyse, manage, and present all types of geographical data. GIS technology uses data-mining to detect areas where people talk about the disease and creates heatmaps. These maps can help healthcare professionals and other key stakeholders in better tracking and zooming into a specific location to tackle the spread of a disease. Harvard Medical School professor and Chief Innovation Officer at Boston Children˚Ä˚s Hospital John Brownstein had his team build Healthmap after the 2003 SARS epidemic, which scrapes news reports, chatrooms and more to build a visual picture of how the coronavirus is spreading. It supplements data-gathering techniques by governments around the world and is also used in the WHO˚Ä˚s Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources Initiative. TACKLING MISINFORMATION Another area technology could help us in is to make sense of the misinformation spreading online fuelling unnecessary hysteria and fear ˚Ä˚ and in some cases xenophobia ˚Ä˚ sometimes pushed by bots to create the false impression of many people talking about a particular subject and launch coordinated campaigns.

14 Feb 2020 06:54PM,Public Health Preparedness Clinics reactivated to reduce risk of COVID-19 spread,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Hundreds of general practitioner (GP) clinics will be reactivated as Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) as part of efforts to better detect and manage COVID-19 infections, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Friday (Feb 14). The ministry added that this is a ""proactive step"" to reduce the risk of further community spread. Many local confirmed cases had continued to ""circulate in the community"" or gone to work when they were already ill, the health ministry noted. ""This is why MOH had earlier given guidance to doctors to provide medical certificates (MCs) of five days for patients with respiratory symptoms so they could stay home to recover,"" said the ministry in a press release. The National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) has also observed that a ""significant number"" of Singapore's COVID-19 cases had mild symptoms in the initial phase of infection. ""Similar to influenza, these patients typically experience mild flu-like symptoms such as fever and cough. And similar to influenza, they can be infectious during this initial period of mild symptoms,"" said MOH. ""The risk of their infecting others can be reduced with appropriate measures."" SUBSIDIES AT PHPCS, POLYCLINICS There are currently about 900 GP clinics designated as PHPCs. From Feb 18, the PHPCs will be ""progressively activated"" to care for patients with respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat and runny nose, said MOH. Patients suspected to have pneumonia will be referred to hospitals for further tests and care.  These clinics, which provide subsidised treatment, investigations and medication during public health outbreaks, were previously activated to deal with haze and the H1N1 influenza pandemic. ""These preparedness clinics are an important line of defence during our public health outbreaks,"" said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong. ""The activation of these preparedness clinics is not new."" The PHPCs will provide ""special subsidies"" for Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents (PRs) diagnosed with respiratory illnesses, said MOH. Patients with respiratory symptoms can also go to polyclinics, where the subsidies will also apply. Singapore citizens and PRs diagnosed with respiratory illnesses at the PHPCs and polyclinics will pay a flat subsidised rate of S$10 for their consultation and treatment. Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation seniors will pay S$5. ""The activation of PHPCs and polyclinics will allow us to enhance and tighten disease surveillance. We would be able to detect the virus earlier, and reduce the risk of further transmission,"" MOH added. The clinics can be identified by a PHPC decal. Members of the public can also visit https://www.flugowhere.gov.sg/, where a list of PHPCs will be updated from Feb 18.   MOH's director of medical services Kenneth Mak told reporters that GPs undergo a ""process of enrolment"" when they apply to join the scheme. This includes teaching them the importance of infection control and training them to use personal protective equipment, Associate Professor Mak said. ""So, there is a little bit more work done in order to make sure they are better prepared to deal with patients that have infectious diseases,"" he added. ""It is not that ordinary GPs cannot manage such conditions, but these GPs (PHPCs) have been given additional training, additional preparation that they've done such that in times like this, we have a ready group of doctors and their clinics who are able to stand up and then further support as we then manage an outbreak in a crisis."" These PHPCs will help refer patients to hospital if they are suspected to have pneumonia FOLLOW 5-DAY MC Most patients with respiratory symptoms are not infected with COVID-19, said the health ministry. ""But we must take extra precautions,"" MOH added. ""It is therefore important that anyone with respiratory symptoms (such as fever, cough, sore throat and runny nose) seek medical treatment early, and stay home throughout their illness. ""We urge all individuals and employers to cooperate and follow strictly the five-day MC regime that has been put in place."" Healthcare professionals have been advised to provide MCs of five days for patients with respiratory symptoms. Patients will be referred for further medical assessment and tests if they do not recover within five days.   When asked how MOH decided on the five-day period, Assoc Prof Mak said the ministry looked at the normal duration which patients with respiratory problems recover from their illness.  ""The majority of people will recover within three to four days,"" he added. ""Having therefore a little bit of extra period to allow them to properly recover, setting that duration of about five days allows us to reduce the noise factor. ""Most people with minor conditions would have recovered by then, and it (five days) allows us to look and determine whether there are other patients who are still not getting better, who might be getting worse, and we then want them to come back to the GP ... to reassess - these are the patients that might be referred to the hospital for further testing."" The ministry also advised patients to return to the same doctor to seek further treatment if their symptoms persist or deteriorate. ""Patients must recognise the importance of staying home when unwell,"" it added. ""Mixing in large crowds, or continuing to go to work or school when ill, even with mild symptoms, will put others at risk.""   The ministry added it would be taking further pre-emptive measures to reduce the risk of community transmission. With enhanced detection and surveillance, it expects to see more confirmed COVID-19 cases in the coming days, it said. ""Activating the PHPCs is a proactive step to reduce the risk of further community spread of the virus,"" MOH added. ""I hope we can work together to fight this disease. If each of us play our role and be socially responsible, we can minimise the risk, reduce the risk of further community transmission,"" Mr Gan said.  On Friday, Singapore confirmed nine new cases of COVID-19, taking the total number of people infected to 67. The coronavirus started in the Chinese city of Wuhan but has since spread to more than 25 countries. More than 1,300 people have died from the coronavirus and more than 63,000 people have been infected, the vast majority in China.

18 Feb 2020 12:55PM,Singapore Airlines to cut flights as COVID-19 outbreak hits demand,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore Airlines (SIA) will temporarily cut flights across its global network in the three months to May, it said on Tuesday (Feb 18), as a coronavirus epidemic hits demand for services to the Asian city state, as well as through the key transit hub. In the announcement published on its website, SIA provided a link to the list of flights that will be affected by the decision. Key affected destinations include Frankfurt, Jakarta, London, Los Angeles, Mumbai, Paris, Seoul, Sydney and Tokyo, the airline said. ""Singapore Airlines and SilkAir will temporarily reduce services across our network due to weak demand as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak,"" the carrier said. ""We will continue to monitor the situation and make further adjustments as necessary."" The airline added that affected customers will be ""notified and re-accommodated onto other flights. ""If you have booked your tickets through a travel agency, please contact your agent for assistance. If you have booked your tickets directly with Singapore Airlines, please contact the SIA reservations team at (+65) 6223-8888 if you need any assistance,"" the airline said. The cuts follow major reductions already announced in services to mainland China and Hong Kong. In the Dec quarter, flights to mainland China made up 11 per cent of capacity for the airline, and more than that for budget arm Scoot. ""It's not a surprise to see some cuts in flights, given the weak forward bookings that can be expected from the current environment,"" said DBS analyst Paul Yong. Demand on flights to South Korea and Japan had been hit hardest after China, Yong quoted Singapore Airlines' management team as having told analysts at a results briefing on Monday. Those were the areas of the biggest cutbacks in Tuesday's announcement. Singapore's tally of 77 cases of the virus is one of the highest outside mainland China, where more than 1,800 people have been killed in the epidemic. Last week, the Asian tourism and travel hub said it expected visitor numbers to drop by a quarter or more this year, hit by the virus outbreak. Besides visitors to the city-state, Singapore Airlines also relies heavily on transit traffic. Premium travel has suffered after many business events were cancelled across Asia because of the virus. Hong Kong-based rival Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd has said it is cutting 40 per cent of capacity across its network, up from 30 per cent earlier, due to weak demand.

17 Feb 2020 06:19PM,MTI inspects 3 Stars' premises amid complaints of COVID-19 mask profiteering,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) is taking further action against 3 Stars, after the retailer failed to respond adequately to the ministry's queries on why its mask prices were so high, amid the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. A letter of demand was sent to the retailer last week following complaints from consumers. The letter asked 3 Stars to explain ""the basis of their selling prices for the sale of masks"", including cost price and profit margins. However despite ""repeated exchanges"" with 3 Stars, the information it provided remained incomplete and its pricing practices have not changed, said MTI in a news release on Monday (Feb 17). ""MTI has therefore exercised powers under the (Price Control Act) to conduct inspections on Feb 17, 2020 at 3 StarsÅEÄÅE registered business address and warehouse, as well as five of its retail outlets,""t said. The ministry said it would assess the need for further action after reviewing 3 Stars' responses and information gathered from the inspections. The retailer is required by law to provide complete information and documentation explaining the basis of their selling prices, including invoices and sales receipts. If it fails to fully comply, it could be penalised under the Price Control Act. The Government has been ""closely monitoring"" retail practices and complaints from consumers regarding profiteering, said MTI. Letters of demand will be issued to those suspected of profiteering. Last month, the ministry issued five letters - one letter of demand to Deen Express and four requests for information to e-commerce platforms Lazada, Carousell, Qoo10 and Shopee. The supply of masks has proven a contentious topic amid the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization chief warned the world was running out of masks and other protective equipment against the novel coronavirus. The organisation said prices for some items were up to 20 times higher than normal, and its chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters the problem was being made worse by ""inappropriate use"" of masks by people who were neither sick nor medical staff. Singapore authorities last month announced that each Singapore household would receive four surgical face masks, after reports of long queues for masks at retailers across the island. The country has confirmed 75 cases of the disease as of Sunday.

13 Feb 2020 04:05PM,Commentary: What to do with all these health rumours and forwarded messages in the time of COVID-19?,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners As developments over the coronavirus outbreak unfold, all of us will have to exercise patience and care in fighting falsehoods, says an observer. BEIJING: China˚Ä˚s COVID-19 outbreak has also sparked an epidemic of online panic. When SARS hit in 2003, 6 per cent of China˚Ä˚s population was online; now almost 60 per cent are. The average user of WeChat, the country˚Ä˚s dominant social media platform, spends 90 minutes a day on the app. As a result, while more than 40,000 patients in China are fighting the virus, the entire country is facing an onslaught of online media ˚Ä˚ much of it disinformation. COVID-19 ON SOCIAL MEDIA There are important upsides to the proliferation of social media in China. It enables citizen reporting of a kind rarely seen in the country ˚Ä˚ such as video blogs from Wuhan, the city at the heart of the epidemic. Such independent reporting is essential in China˚Ä˚s tightly state-controlled media environment. At the same time, however, the flow of information is bigger than ever. Receiving information straight to your phone, in real time, can make you feel like the virus is closing in on you ˚Ä˚ even if it˚Ä˚s not. Being surrounded by panic-inducing headlines, whether true or false, has its own impact on health. A recent study in the Lancet about the impact of the Hong Kong protests on mental health found that spending more than two hours a day following such events on social media was associated with an increased likelihood of post-traumatic stress and depression, although the direction of causality is unclear. REAL OR FAKE?   Amid the deluge of coronavirus news, some find it hard to distinguish between real and fake. Last week, my grandpa texted me on WeChat: ˚Ä˚Viruses are scared of acid. Twice a day ...˚Ä˚dab a cotton bud with strong vinegar and stick it inside your nose. It will help greatly with the current virus outbreak.˚Ä˚ I didn˚Ä˚t reach for the cotton buds. Friends told me they had received similar messages from relatives, asking them to dab sesame oil in their nostrils or avoid wearing wool. They often came via that most tricky of social arenas: the family group chat. Many messages, like my grandpa˚Ä˚s, were copy-and-paste rumours that looked at first glance like genuine texts. Many begin with conversational openings: ˚Ä˚A friend who works in a hospital told me˚Äf˚Ä˚ Others include a cry of urgency: ˚Ä˚I just got this message!˚Ä˚ Or: ˚Ä˚Important news.˚Ä˚ Such messages remind me of those that circulated ahead of last December˚Ä˚s UK election, after the Yorkshire Evening Post reported the story of a sick child forced to sleep on the floor of a hospital because of a lack of beds. Once the story broke, social media posts trying to discredit it proliferated, often opening with: ÅEÄÅEA friend who is a nurse told meÅEÄ¶ÅEÄÅE In response, James Mitchinson, editor of the Post, asked one critic: ÅEÄÅEWhy do you trust (this social media accountÅEÄÅEs) claim over the newspaper youÅEÄÅEve taken for years in good faith?ÅEÄÅE DISPELLING MISINFORMATION   In China, though, people are increasingly unsure whether they can take the media in good faith. There has been widespread anger at the government over its hushing up of virus cases in the early stages of the outbreak, and over the police punishment of the young whistle-blower doctor who had warned of a new strain of coronavirus, and who, tragically, died from it last week. The first step in dispelling misinformation is establishing an alternative source of credibility.

19 Feb 2020 04:08PM,COVID-19: Elated passengers leave Cambodia cruise ship after virus all-clear,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia: Dozens of passengers stuck for nearly a week on a US cruise ship in Cambodia disembarked Wednesday (Feb 19), after being given the all-clear from a deadly coronavirus. The Westerdam made shore in Sihanoukville on Feb 13 after being rejected by five countries over fears its passengers could be carrying the new virus, which has killed more than 2,000 people. Hundreds were allowed off after basic health checks - among them an 83-year-old American woman who was later diagnosed with the virus while in transit in Malaysia. That raised fears many other Westerdam passengers could be spreading the virus as they scattered, although no other cases have been recorded. Once the American woman's case was discovered, the remaining passengers on the Westerdam were ordered to stay on board, but they have now all been given a clean bill of health. Swabs from the more than 700 crew members aboard were still being collected, a Sihanoukville provincial spokesman told AFP. Cambodia's wily premier Hun Sen squeezed PR value from the arrival of the US-owned ship, greeting the first passengers to leave the ship with hugs and flowers. ""Thank you very much Mr. Prime Minister,"" a jubilant passenger - one among 230 who disembarked on Wednesday - told local TV as she left the ship. ""I didn't know him before so I am just grateful that he let us in."" The head of cruise operator Holland America said he was thankful for the help Cambodia provided. ""It's been a whirlwind, and I want to take a moment to say how sincerely appreciative of each and every one of you we are,"" Orlando Ashford told a crowd of passengers and crew, later walking off to the Sister Sledge song ""We are Family"".   In Phnom Penh, former passengers staying at a luxury hotel since Saturday rejoiced after Cambodia's health ministry said more than 700 people tested over the past two days have been cleared. ""All passengers have normal health with no noticeable problems and no-one had high temperatures,"" the ministry said in a statement. American Christina Kerby said it was ""great news"", but she was worried about the stigma dogging Westerdam passengers - especially once they return home. ""I want people to remember that ... there's a human behind each of these stories, and those who are ill deserve compassion,"" she told AFP. The news comes as Southeast Asian foreign ministers prepared for a summit in Laos on Thursday with their Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the COVID-19 outbreak. Cambodia, like many of its regional neighbours, is a staunch ally of Beijing. It receives billions of dollars in soft loans, infrastructure, and investment from China.

12 Feb 2020 08:23PM,Cruise ship stranded by COVID-19 fears to dock in Cambodia,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BANGKOK: Cambodia has agreed to let a cruise ship, that has been turned away by five countries over fears that someone aboard may have the coronavirus, to dock and disembark its passengers, the Holland America Line said on Wednesday (Feb 12). For nearly two weeks, the MS Westerdam, a ship of healthy passengers, had been sailing throughout Asia after being turned away by Japan, Taiwan, Guam and the Philippines over fears that someone on the cruise could have the new flu-like virus that has killed more than 1,100 people, almost all of them in China. ""We will immediately begin making our way to Sihanoukville in Cambodia,"" Westerdam captain Vincent Smit told passengers, according to a recording of the announcement reviewed by Reuters. ""There will be a brief health inspection on board by the Cambodian authorities which will take place at anchor just before we arrive alongside,"" said Smit. The ship is expected to arrive in Cambodia around 7am on Thursday, he said. The latest country to shun the ship, which has 1,455 passengers and 802 crew on board, had been Thailand, where the health minister refused to grant the Westerdam permission to dock. ""The staff has tried to bolster spirits but you can only play so many games of trivia,"" Angela Jones, a business consultant from the US state of Georgia, told Reuters in a video recording sent before the news that Cambodia would take the ship. ""I've asked others who say they are napping a lot."" Like many on board, Jones had embarked in Hong Kong for a much-anticipated cruise through the region in early February. It was scheduled to be a two-week cruise, but with that period running out this week, there had been worries about fuel and food supplies. Many on board are elderly and there was also concerns they could be running out of medicines. CHESS AND SQUABBLES To kill time and break up the monotony of endless ocean scrolling past cabin windows, the ship's crew have organised dozens of activities to keep people occupied, tourists on board the vessel told Reuters. People could be seen playing chess and doing puzzles on Wednesday, in some of the first pictures published by media of life aboard the ship. Other activities on offer included colouring-in for adults; teeth whitening; poker tournaments; whisky tasting; even a lecture on modern China which delved into the economics of collective farming, according to passengers on board and a copy of the ship's activity programme seen by Reuters. Passengers on board the ship have been subjected to regular health checks, according to Holland America, the ship operator and a unit of Miami-based Carnival Corp. There have been no reported cases of the coronavirus on board. Stoking fears of authorities in countries on the ship's route has been the ongoing quarantine in Japan of the Diamond Princess, cruise ship, also managed by a unit of Carnival Corp. A total of 175 out of the 3,700 people on board the Diamond Princess have tested positive for the coronavirus. Late on Wednesday, the Westerdam changed its course away from Bangkok and began heading towards Cambodia, according to data published by the Marine Traffic ship tracking website. Earlier, the Thai Navy ""Bhumibol Adulyadej"" warship could be seen escorting the Westerdam in waters just off the Thai coast, according to passengers and Marine Traffic. Despite the uncertainty, crew members had staged a farewell ceremony for passengers on Wednesday morning, singing to the tune of the 1979 hit ""We Are Family"" by Sister Sledge. Elsewhere on board, the patience of some passengers has been tested by the prolonged uncertainty, Jones said, as some people pushed and shoved for access to one of the ship's only available computers and printers, to re-book flights home. ""Hard to imagine these senior cruisers coming to blows but guess that happened,"" said Jones. ""It's funny and sad at the same time"".

For the transport sector, the Government, taxi and private-hire operators have already announced a S$77 million package to help taxi and private-hire drivers affected by the outbreak. The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) has said it will waive licence fees for hotels, travel agents and tour guides, as well as defray the cleaning costs of hotels that accommodated confirmed and suspected cases of the virus. STB said on Tuesday that the tourism sector will take a ˚Ä˚significant hit˚Ä˚ due to the outbreak, with visitor arrivals estimated to tumble by 25 to 30 per cent this year. The Government has also said it is expecting a knock-on impact on related industries and firms, adding that it is prepared to support companies and workers in the event of a broad-based slowdown in the com""ng months. This includes measures like helping firms retain and train their employees by supporting part of their wage costs.

18 Feb 2020 12:32AM,Chinese doctors 'using plasma therapy' on COVID-19 patients,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SHANGHAI: Doctors in Shanghai are using infusions of blood plasma from people who have recovered from the coronavirus to treat those still battling the infection, reporting some encouraging preliminary results, a Chinese professor said on Monday (Feb 17). A top emergency expert at the World Health Organization (WHO) said later that using convalescent plasma was a ""very valid"" approach to test, but that it was important to get the timing right to maximise the boost to a patient's immunity. The coronavirus epidemic is believed to have originated in a seafood market in the central city of Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, and has so far killed 1,770 people and infected more than 70,000 in mainland China. China's financial hub of Shanghai on Monday had 332 infected cases, one of whom died in recent weeks. Lu Hongzhou, professor and co-director of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre, said that 184 cases were still hospitalised, including 166 mild cases, while 18 were in serious and critical conditions.   He said the hospital had set up a special clinic to administer plasma therapy and was selecting patients who were willing to donate. The blood would be screened to check if he or she had other diseases like hepatitis B or C, he added. ""We are positive that this method can be very effective in our patients,"" he said. There are no fully licensed treatments or vaccines against the new coronavirus, and the process of developing and testing drugs can take many months and even years. 'VERY IMPORTANT AREA' Convalescent plasma has been proven ""effective and life-saving"" against other infectious diseases, including rabies and diphtheria, Dr Mike Ryan, head of WHO's health emergencies programme, told reporters in Geneva. ""It is a very important area to pursue,"" Ryan said. ""Because what hyperimmune globulin does is it concentrates the antibodies in a recovered patient. You are essentially giving the new victim's immune system a boost of antibodies to hopefully get them through the very difficult phase. ""So it must be given at the right time, because it mops up the virus in the system, and it just gives the new patient's immune system a vital push at the time it needs it. But it has to be carefully timed and it's not always successful."" Ryan added: ""So it is a very important area of discovery, and I believe they are starting trials on that in China. But it is a very valid way to explore therapeutics, especially when we don't have vaccines and we don't have specific antivirals."" As well as using plasma therapies, the Chinese doctors are also trying antiviral drugs licensed for use against other infections to see if they might help. Scientists are testing two antiviral drugs and preliminary results are due in weeks, while the head of a Wuhan hospital had said plasma infusions from recovered patients had shown some encouraging preliminary results.

The death toll leapt by a record 242, more than double the prior provincial daily record of 103 set on Monday, , while the number of new cases soared by 14,840 - also a daily record - to a total of 48,206 cases in Hubei. Health officials in the province, the epicentre of the epidemic, said they had started including people diagnosed using the new methods from Thursday. Excluding cases confirmed using the new methods, the number of new cases rose by only 1,508, the official data showed. The provincial health commission said last week that it would begin recognising computerised tomography (CT) scan results as confirmation of infections, allowing hospitals to isolate patients more quickly. It also said it had revised its old data and previous assessments of suspected cases.  Hubei health commission said the change would mean patients could get treatment ""as early as possible"" and be ""consistent"" with the classification used in other provinces. It said it had made the change ""as our understanding of pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus deepens, and as we accumulate experience in diagnosis and treatment"".

Experts questioned the change, with Victor Shih, a specialist in Chinese politics at the School of Global Policy & Strategy at UC San Diego, saying the sudden jump in new cases raises questions about China's commitment to transparency. ""The adjustment of the data today proved without doubt that they have had two sets of numbers for confirmed infected all along,"" he said. ""If that were not the case, the government could not have added so many new cases in one day. ""A very disturbing aspect of todayÅEÄÅEs new numbers is that the vast majority of new cases accrued to Wuhan, but what if the rest of Hubei province still did not adjust their reporting methods?"" Hubei had previously only allowed infection to be confirmed by RNA tests, which can take days to process and delay treatment. RNA, or ribonucleic acid, carries genetic information allowing for identification of organisms like viruses. Using CT scans that reveal lung infection would help patients receive treatment as soon as possible and improve their chances of recovery, the commission said. It could also lead to a spike in the death toll, according to Raina McIntyre, head of biosecurity research at the Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. ""Presumably, there are deaths which occurred in people who did not have a lab diagnosis but did have a CT. It is important that these also be counted,"" she told Reuters. She said the numbers could all be revised retrospectively from December, and it now depended on whether the more severely ill patients were confirmed by lab diagnoses and therefore included in the original numbers. If many of them were diagnosed using the newly included CT method and only now added to the total number of cases, then the death rate could rise. ""I think the new category 'positive test' (which is different from 'confirmed case') is more likely to reflect asymptomatic cases. Ideally these should be reported too, or we do not get a complete picture,"" said McIntyre. A shortage of RNA test kits in Hubei's capital Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated, has been a problem and may have delayed patients from being properly diagnosed and treated, contributing to the spread of the virus in the early days of the outbreak. China has placed around 56 million people in virtual quarantine in Hubei since late last month and restricted movements of millions more in cities far from the epicentre in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus.

To date, Malaysia has a total of 22 confirmed novel coronavirus cases. In a press conference, Minister for Health Dzulkefly Ahmad said the two who recovered are both Malaysians who were treated at the Sungai Buloh Hospital. ÅEÄÅEThe first one is Case 17, which is the 65-year old woman who was found to have contact with Case 9 and was confirmed positive for the virus on Feb 9. ÅEÄÅEThe second case, Case 18, is the 31-year old male who works in Macau. He was also confirmed positive on Feb 9,ÅEÄÅE said the minister. Case 17 is the mother-in-law of a Malaysian man who attended a conference at the Grand Hyatt in Singapore. He became the first Malaysian citizen to be infected with the virus.   ""T BE COMPLACENT"" Dr Dzulkefly however quickly added that Malaysians should not be complacent and should continue to take precautions. ÅEÄÅEI am very thankful to all the medical personnel who worked had for this to be possible. However I may say please do not be complacent. ÅEÄÅEBecause just across the causeway of Johor Bahru, Singapore ... raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) risk assessment level to Orange,ÅEÄÅE he said. The Singapore Ministry of Health had raised the DORSCON level from Yellow to Orange on Feb 7. Dr Dzulkefly stressed that it was important for anyone who has flu symptoms to continue using face masks and for others to maintain good hygiene by sanitising often.   JOINT WORKING GROUP TO MEET The minister also confirmed that his deputy will be meeting with the deputy health minister of Singapore next Tuesday. This meeting between the health ministries of both countries would be the first meeting since the nations set up a joint working committee on Feb 11.

14 Feb 2020 06:54PM,"9 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore, including 6 linked to Grace Assembly of God cluster","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore reported nine more confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Friday (Feb 14), the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a daily update. Of them, six are linked to a cluster from the Grace Assembly of God church, director of medical services at MOH Kenneth Mak said at a press conference. This brings the total number of novel coronavirus cases in Singapore to 67, with six patients in critical condition.   Two more patients, case 30 and 45, have been discharged from hospital as of Friday, meaning 17 people have now fully recovered from the disease. Case 30 is a 27-year-old man who attended a private business meeting at Grand Hyatt Singapore, which has also been identified as a cluster, while case 45 is a two-year-old girl who was among the 92 Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30. Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said on Friday that the Government is concerned that many of confirmed cases had remained in the community, and some went to work while ill. ""This is not helpful in our efforts to reduce the risk of community transmission,"" he said. He announced that 900 GP clinics will be re-activated as Public Health Preparedness Clinics to provide subsidised treatment for patients with respiratory symptoms. This will help the authorities to detect the virus earlier and reduce the risk of further transmission, MOH said in a statement. One of the newly confirmed cases on Friday is an employee at PUB, the national water agency said. PUB said in a media statement that the employee is an administrative staff member who works in the agencyÅEÄÅEs Environment Building, and is not involved in plant ""field operations. All employees on the affected level of the building - 70 staff members in total - were asked to leave the office and telecommute for the rest of the day, so that the space could be disinfected. The first two cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God church, which has a branch in Tanglin and another in Bukit Batok, were announced on Wednesday, while five others were announced on Thursday. There are 13 in the cluster after six more were announced on Friday. When asked about whether there was a ""super spreader"" related to the Grace Assembly of God cluster, Mr Mak said there was not enough information as of now to identify a particular individual as being a super spreader, or to suspect that this is indeed the case.  ""Within the cluster, individuals possibly may have spread within the family. ItÅEÄÅEs not necessarily the case that itÅEÄÅEs one individual being a super spreader and spreading it,""said.   MOH also gave more details on five of the cases (54, 55, 56, 57, 58) it announced on Thursday. Among them was a 30-year-old man who worked on Pulau Bukom, where Shell has a refinery. On Friday night, Shell confirmed that a contractor working on its Pulau Bukom manufacturing site had contracted COVID-19. DORSCON RED RUMOUR Singapore last week raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange, prompting additional precautionary measures. Mr Gan urged media at the press conference to help ""him stop the rumour"" that Singapore was moving into DORSCON Red, the most severe phase in the colour-coded system. ""It is difficult enough, challenging enough for us to try to stop the spread of the virus. We donÅEÄÅEt really want to have to spend effort in stopping the spread of the rumours. I want to say categorically that we have no plans to go to DORSCON Red,""e said.  Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong, who is co-chair of a multi-ministry task force set up to deal with COVID-19 said that that the strategy in Singapore might change if there is widespread community transmission both here and overseas. ""We are unlikely to continue contact tracing every single individual ... we will move away from that strategy. Instead we will look at the patients who come forward,"" he said. He quoted a World Health Organisation (WHO) study on 17,000 people that showed that a majority - 82 per cent - had mild symptoms. Those who show mild symptoms here can visit a GP, make sure they take necessary precautions, rest and avoid going and they will ""recover in due course"", Mr Wong said. Singapore is bracing itself for the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on its economy, with Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat saying that the upcoming Budget statement on Feb 18 will contain detailed measures for the hardest-hit sectors - tourism and transport. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Friday that the ongoing COVID-19 situation will have a significant impact on the countryÅEÄÅEs economy for the next couple of quarters, calling the current outbreak ÅEÄÅEvery intenseÅEÄÅE. The disease, officially named COVID-19 on Tuesday, has killed nearly 1,400 people, with tens of thousands infected, mostly in mainland China. It has now spread beyond China to more than 25 countries, with the World Health Organization declaring a public health emergency last month. Japan on Thursday reported its first death of a person infected with the virus - a woman in her 80s living in Kanagawa prefecture, west of Tokyo. Her death brings to three the number of fatalities from the virus outside mainland China. ABOUT THE CONFIRMED CASES Case 59 is a 61-year-old Singaporean man w""recent travel history to China. He is currently warded in an isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). He reported onset of symptoms on Feb 7 and sought treatment at Farrer Park HospitalÅEÄÅEs emergency care clinic three days later. He had a fever and was the only patient at the time, Farrer Park Hospital told CNA in response to a query. Staff at the emergency clinic followed infection control protocol strictly and wore full personal protective equipment, a Farrer Park Hospital spokesperson said. The service officer who was in contact with him also wore a surgical mask that night. "" in after every suspect case, we carried out terminal cleaning and disinfected all rooms, corridors and areas that this patient had been in contact with while he was at [the] emergency clinic,"" the spokesperson said. He went to the emergency department at Mount Elizabeth Hospital on Feb 12 and was conveyed by ambulance to NCID the next day. Prior to hospital admission, he had mostly stayed home at Wilkinson Road except to seek medical treatment. He works as an anaesthesiologist at a private hospital in Singapore, and was not at work since the onset of symptoms. He has no known interactions with past cases. CASE 60, 61, 62, 63, 66, 67 LINKED TO CHURCH Case 60 is a 51 year-old Singaporean woman who is an employee of the Grace Assembly of God church with no recent travel history to China.

She went to NCID four days later and was immediately isolated. Prior to hospital admission, she had mostly stayed at her home at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 and went to work at the Tanglin branch of the church. Case 61 is a 57-year-old Singaporean man with no recent travel history to China. He is currently warded in an isolation room at the National University Hospital (NUH). He is linked to the cluster at Grace Assembly of God. He reported onset of symptoms on Feb 6 and sought treatment at a GP clinic on the same day and again two days later. He went to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital the next day, and to Pioneer Polyclinic on Feb 11 and 12. Prior to hospital admission, he reported that he had mostly stayed at home at Jurong West Street 64, except to go to work for a day at Legacy Office Supplies Pte Ltd in Senang Crescent in Chai Chee. Case 62 is a 44-year-old Singaporean woman with no recent travel history to China. She is currently warded in an isolation room at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH). She is linked to the cluster at Grace Assembly of God. She reported onset of symptoms on Feb 9 and sought treatment at a GP clinic the next day. She went to SGH on Feb 12, and was immediately isolated. Subsequent test results confirmed COVID-19 infection on Feb 13 afternoon. Prior to hospital admission, she reported that he had mostly stayed at home at Tanjong Pagar Road, except to seek medical treatment. Case 63 is a 54-year-old Singaporean woman with no recent travel history to China. She is linked to the cluster at Grace Assembly of God, as is Case 66, a 28-year-old Singaporean man with no recent travel history to China.

18 Feb 2020 09:36AM,More than 80% of COVID-19 patients have mild disease and recover: WHO chief,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners GENEVA: The new novel coronavirus only causes mild disease for 80 per cent of infected patients, said the World Health Organization on Monday (Feb 17). The COVID-19 virus death toll has surpassed 1,800 in China, where it has infected more than 70,500. Speaking to reporters, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that 14 per cent of patients would have severe diseases such as pneumonia. ""Around five percent of cases are considered critical with possible multi-organ failure, septic shock and respiratory failure and, in some cases, death,"" he added. Tedros also said there were ""relatively few cases"" among children and more research was needed to understand why. It ... appears that COVID-19 is not as deadly as other coronaviruses including SARS and MERS. WHO WARNS AGAINST ""BLANKET MEASURES"" The WHO chief also warned against ""blanket measures"" over the novel coronavirus outbreak, pointing out the epidemic outside of China was only affecting a ""tiny"" proportion of the population. WHO officials rejected the suggestion that all cruises should be halted to avoid risking a new nest of infection like the one on the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess off Japan. ""Measures should be taken proportional to the situation. Blanket measures may not help,"" Tedros stressed. The outbreak has battered manufacturing and tourism across the region and led to multiple travel restrictions including for flights and cruises. ""If we are going to disrupt every cruise ship in the world on the off chance that there might be some potential contact with some potential pathogen then where do we stop?"" said Michael Ryan, head of WHO's health emergencies programme. Ryan said that even at the epicentre of the crisis in the city of Wuhan in central Hubei Province, the ""attack rate"" - a measure of the speed of spread of the virus - was four per 100,000. ""This is a very serious outbreak and it has the potential to grow, but we need to balance that in terms of the number of people infected. Outside Hubei this epidemic is affecting a very, very tiny, tiny proportion of people,"" he said. Tedros also referred to an apparent decline in new cases of the disease in recent days but said that the trend ""must be interpreted very cautiously"". ""Trends can change as new populations are affected. It is too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table,"" he said.

15 Feb 2020 08:26AM,"Death toll in China COVID-19 epidemic surges past 1,500","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic surged past 1,500 on Saturday (Feb 15) after 139 more people died in Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak. The province's health commission also reported 2,641 new cases of the COVID-19 strain, about half the number from the previous day. At least 1,523 people have now died from the outbreak that first emerged in Hubei's capital, Wuhan, in December and snowballed into a nationwide epidemic a month later. More than 66,000 people have now been infected, with most deaths occurring in Hubei. National Health Commission official Liang Wannian told a news conference the government would continue to try to contain the spread of virus in Wuhan, which has been under virtual lockdown for three weeks. The number of deaths in Hubei rose by 139 as of Friday, 107 of those in Wuhan. A total of 1,123 people in Wuhan have now died from the coronavirus.   The scale of the epidemic swelled this week after authorities in Hubei changed their criteria for counting cases, adding thousands of new patients to their tally. Cases ""clinically diagnosed"" through lung imaging are now counted in addition to those that have shown up positive in laboratory tests. The revision added nearly 15,000 patients to Hubei's tally on Thursday, with the World Health Organization noting that cases going back weeks were retroactively counted. There were more than 4,800 cases reported in Hubei on Friday. Authorities said 1,716 medical workers have been infected during the outbreak, with six dying from the illness. Most of the infections among health workers were in Hubei's capital, Wuhan, where many have lacked proper masks and gear to protect themselves in hospitals dealing with a deluge of patients. The grim figures come a week after grief and public anger erupted over the death of a whistleblowing doctor who had been reprimanded and silenced by police in Wuhan after raising the alarm about the virus in December.   China is struggling to get the world's second-largest economy going after the Lunar New Year holiday, which was extended by 10 days to help contain the virus. China would maintain a prudent monetary policy and help companies resume production as soon as possible, the vice governor of the central bank told a news conference. The official Beijing Daily newspaper said people failing to obey government orders to quarantine themselves on return from the holidays would be punished. But it was not immediately clear how that would be enforced, or whether the restrictions would apply to non-residents or foreigners arriving from abroad. ""From now on, all those who have returned to Beijing should stay at home or submit to group observation for 14 days after arriving,"" Beijing's virus prevention working group said in a notice cited by the Beijing Daily. ""Those who refuse to accept home or centralised observation and other prevention and control measures will be held accountable under the law,"" it said. The WHO has cautioned that it was ""way too early"" to make any predictions about the disease's trajectory. An international team of WHO experts will arrive in Beijing this weekend for a joint mission with Chinese counterparts. The joint team will inspect three provinces and cities to review the prevention and control measures, visit research centres, and make recommendations for containing the epidemic, according to National Health Commission spokesman Mi Feng.

In a published document, it said police cars, ambulances, vehicles carrying essential goods, or other vehicles related to public service would be exempted. It added that the province will carry out regular health checks on all residents in the province. It also stated that companies cannot resume work without first receiving permission from the government. The number of new cases from China's coronavirus epidemic dropped for a third consecutive day on Sunday, as the World Health Organization (WHO) chief warned it was ""impossible"" to predict how the outbreak would develop. The novel coronavirus has killed 1,665 in mainland China and more than 68,000 people have now been infected - but the number of new cases of the COVID-19 strain continued to decline. In hardest-hit Hubei, the number of new cases slowed for a third consecutive day and at 139 on Saturday. Global concern remains high about the spread of the virus, which first emerged in China's central Hubei province in December, with the first death outside Asia reported in France this weekend.

12 Feb 2020 08:40PM,"COVID-19: Supply chain remains robust, 'panic buying' situation has stabilised, says Lawrence Wong","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The panic buying situation that was seen after Singapore raised its coronavirus risk assessment level last week has stabilised, although some outlets may not be fully stocked yet due to manpower and logistics issues, said Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong. Even so, Singapore's supply chain remains robust and the major retailers should resume ""normal stock levels in a day or two"", he said at a press conference on Wednesday (Feb 12). During the surge in demand, retailers had to move stock very quickly from the warehouse into their stores, he said. Many of them activated extra people to stock shelves and contracted additional logistics companies to support their operations, Mr Wong added. Many people had to work overtime as well in order to make sure shelves were restocked, said Mr Wong, as he thanked those involved for stepping up their response.  Last week, Singapore raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange after clusters of the coronavirus surfaced locally. This prompted a ""wave of panic buying"", said Mr Wong. Stores in Singapore saw a sudden surge in demand for groceries, leaving some shops temporarily out of stock. But the fact that Singapore was able to meet that sudden demand proves that its diversification strategy is able to protect the system from any sudden shocks, Mr Wong said.  ""So we just want to continue to assure Singaporeans that our supply chains, when it comes to food and grocery items, remain robust. Our diversification strategy ensures that we are protected from any sudden shocks,"" he said. ""We were able to meet that demand. It was simply a matter of getting the supplies out from the warehouse into the retail outlets, and the supply chain that we have remain robust,"" he added. PANIC ""SPREADS FASTER"" ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAN THE TRUTH Authorities can understand why people were concerned and anxious, said the minister, but the response from the public last week demonstrates the challenges in conveying ""accurate information"" to the public in such situations. ""When we went around asking, there was some misunderstanding, or even a lack of clarity around what was going on, what DORSCON Orange meant, despite our best efforts at explaining to all of you,"" he told reporters. ""We briefed editors beforehand, but you know, in times like this, it just goes to show how challenging it is to get accurate information out,"" he said. ""In today's world of social media, fear, uncertainty and panic spreads a lot faster on social media than the truth, which is boring and nobody wants to share."" The authorities will ""double down"" on efforts to ""continue to push out information in a timely manner"". ""We are doing daily briefings now to the media. We hope all of you will help us too, to get the information across,"" he told reporters.  The Government will disseminate any information it has that is ""relevant and useful"", said the minister. However, if it is something it does not know about or is unable to make an accurate assessment of, ""we will have to be honest and we will tell you that we do not know,"" he added. He gave the example of people asking how the novel coronavirus situation will unfold in the coming days and weeks. ""The honest answer is ÅEÄÅE it is still too early to tell,""aid Mr Wong. ""We really can't say whether it will get better, whether it will get worse, what sort of situation is going to unfold."" As Singapore steps up its surveillance and does more testing of cases, the country can expect to see more cases coming up ""in the coming days and weeks"", he said. DON'T SPECULATE ABOUT WHETHER DORSCON WILL CHANGE COLOUR The minister also spoke about the DORSCON framework, saying that people should not speculate about when the colour-coded framework will change. ""Let's not get into this thing about speculating, anticipating, worrying whether it's going to turn from Orange to Red, which I think to some extent happened when it went from Yellow to Orange, and then it created that sense of panic and concern,"" he said.  The focus instead should be on the measures put in place, because each colour can contain a range of measures. ""We are in Orange, and within Orange we can put in place a whole range of measures that are more than what we have today,"" he said. Singapore authorities on Wednesday confirmed three new cases of the novel coronavirus, taking the total number of people who have tested positive in Singapore to 50. Eight of them are in critical condition. Six more patients have been discharged, the authorities said on Wednesday, meaning that 15 people have fully recovered.

18 Feb 2020 06:41PM,"Singapore will continue monitoring COVID-19 situation, prepare for different scenarios: Gan Kim Yong","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Health Minister Gan Kim Yong on Tuesday (Feb 18) expressed confidence in Singapore˚Ä˚s ability to overcome the COVID-19 outbreak and ˚Ä˚emerge stronger as a nation˚Ä˚. Rsponding to questions from Members of Parliament (MPs), Mr Gan said in Parliament that Singapore will continue to monitor the situation and prepare for different scenarios. ˚Ä˚Together, with everyone playing our part and staying united, we are confident that we will overcome this outbreak and emerge stronger as a nation,˚Ä˚ he said. Singapore has reported 77 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of Monday. Of these, 53 are still in hospital, including four who are in the intensive care unit. The COVID-19 virus has infected more than 72,000 people and killed nearly 1,900, mostly in mainland China, where it is believed to have originated. More than 20 of the cases in Singapore were imported. Many are Chinese nationals who entered Singapore on or before Jan 23, the date China authorities imposed a lockdown on Wuhan to prevent the spread of the virus. At least six of the imported cases are Singaporeans who were evacuated from Wuhan on Scoot flights on Jan 30 and Feb 9. They include a two-year-old girl who was diagnosed with the virus on Feb 10 and a one-year-old boy confirmed on Feb 16. Several local clusters have also been identified. ˚Ä˚Contact tracing has helped us identify five local clusters and investigations on these clusters are ongoing. Contact tracing is also underway for the remaining seven locally transmitted cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to mainland China,˚Ä˚ Mr Gan said. PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES MP Lim Biow Chuan asked what other measures Singaporeans can take to protect themselves from being infected by the coronavirus. Mr Gan cited the precautionary measures Singapore has put in place since January, including travel restrictions, contact tracing and placing identified close contacts under quarantine. ˚Ä˚Today, we activated the Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) to strengthen our defences at the primary care front to better detect and manage COVID-19 cases,˚Ä˚ he said, adding that the clinics will provide subsidised care for patients with respiratory illness. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has instructed doctors to provide medical certificates of five days to patients who present respiratory symptoms so that they can stay at home while they recover. This follows observations that several local confirmed cases had mingled in public or gone to work, even when they were ill. ÅEÄÅEWe urge individuals with respiratory symptoms (such as fever, cough, sore throat and runny nose) to seek medical treatment at the PHPCs or polyclinics early, and stay home throughout their MC period,ÅEÄÅE he said. INSIGHTS INTO VIRUS Mr Gan also responded to MP Rahayu M"", who asked if there are new insights on how the virus is spread. ÅEÄÅEKnowledge of COVID-19 is still evolving as scientists around the world work to better understand the virus,ÅEÄÅE said Mr Gan. ÅEÄÅEMOH studies the latest reports, consults international infectious diseases experts and keeps in touch with other health authorities to gain greater knowledge of the virus and how it is transmitted. ÅEÄÅEThe current medical assessment still points to COVID-19 spreading mainly through droplets and physical contact from an infected person. Based on evidence available in China, an expert from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has said that there is c""no evidence that the virus can be transmitted through aerosol.ÅEÄÅE Mr Gan also reiterated the importance of each person helping to curb the spread of disease by being socially responsible and practising good personal hygiene. ÅEÄÅEEach person should also monitor his or her health closely, take temperature twice daily, see a doctor when unwell and stay home to rest, and if they must go out, for example to see a doctor, wear a mask,ÅEÄÅE he said.

17 Feb 2020 08:11AM,Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. ˚Ä˚Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,˚Ä˚ the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore˚Ä˚s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. ˚Ä˚As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,˚Ä˚ Mr Lim said. ˚Ä˚MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.˚Ä˚ The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI˚Ä˚s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government˚Ä˚s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018˚Ä˚s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country˚Ä˚s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018˚Ä˚s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a ˚Ä˚modest growth˚Ä˚ in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board˚Ä˚s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON ˚Ä˚STRONG˚Ä˚ BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a ˚Ä˚strong˚Ä˚ relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million ˚Ä˚ way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003˚Ä˚s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. ÅEÄÅEA strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,ÅEÄÅE he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a ÅEÄÅEsizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset packageÅEÄÅE. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: ÅEÄÅEPolicymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response ",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764
19 Feb 2020 01:40PM,Construction at Seletar Aerospace Heights halted since first COVID-19 case reported,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The real estate company behind the Seletar Aerospace Heights work sites linked to five cases of COVID-19 ""immediately halted construction"" after it was notified of the first confirmed case on Feb 9. Boustead Projects confirmed in a media release on Tuesday (Feb 18) that the five Bangladeshi Work Pass holders - identified as Cases 42, 47, 52, 56 and 69 by the Ministry of Health (MOH) - are all workers under the companyÅEÄÅEs subcontractors. They had worked at a project site at Seletar Aerospace Heights, where construction was ongoing to expand the Singapore Service Centre of Canadian aviation firm Bombardier. The five workers are not known to have worked or entered the existing facility, the Bombardier Service Centre at 10 Seletar Aerospace Heights, and their activities were limited to the expansion sites at 8 and 12 Seletar Aerospace Heights, said Boustead in the release. The company had previously confirmed on Feb 12 that three of its employees were under quarantine. Some Boustead employees are still under quarantine orders, said a company spokesperson on Wednesday in response to CNA queries, but he declined to comment on the exact number of employees or subcontractors' workers under quarantine. Construction was halted to conduct cleaning and disinfection of the""velopment site and the existing facility as a precautionary measure, the company said. After it was notified about the second confirmed case on Feb 11, Boustead collaborated with MOH to conduct further contract tracing and inspection of the development site. Bombardier had said in an earlier statement to CNA that the patients had worked under a third-party contractor at its Singapore Service Centre expansion sites, and are are not employees of Bombardier. Cases 42 and 47 had worked on different buildings on the expansion sites and never had access to the company's existing facility, a Bombardier spokesperson had said. No cases of the virus have been reported among employees at its service centre at 10 Seletar Aerospace Heights. ""The health and safety of our employees is always a top priority at Bombardier, and out of an abundance of caution, Bombardier continues to take the necessary steps to ensure its operations and employees remain safe,"" said the companyÅEÄÅEs spokesperson.   Before the first confirmed case linked to the construction site, Boustead had already put in place temperature screening measures and compulsory health and travel declarations at all of its project sites since Jan 28, it said.

19 Feb 2020 07:06AM,"China's COVID-19 death toll surges past 2,000","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped past 2,000 on Wednesday (Feb 19) after 136 more people died, with the number of new cases falling for a second straight day, according to the National Health Commission. This brings the total number of confirmed cases in mainland China to 74,185. The death toll rose to 2,004, with most of the deaths in central Hubei province, where the virus first emerged in December before spiralling into a nationwide epidemic. In its daily update, the National Health Commission reported 1,749 new cases of people infected with the virus nationwide, the lowest number of new cases this month. The new infections were overwhelmingly in Hubei. Outside the epicentre, there were only 56 new cases reported, falling for the 15th day in a row.   A study released by Chinese officials said most patients have mild cases of the illness, and health officials have described the slowing numbers as an indication that the outbreak is under control. President Xi Jinping, in a phone call with the British prime minister, said China's measures were achieving ""visible progress"", according to state media on Tuesday. However, the World Health Organization has cautioned that it is too early to tell if the decline will continue. On Tuesday the director of a hospital in the central Hubei city of Wuhan became the seventh medical worker to succumb to the COVID-19 illness.

14 Feb 2020 02:30PM,COVID-19 to have 'significant' impact on economy: PM Lee Hsien Loong,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The ongoing COVID-19 situation will have a significant impact on Singapore's economy for the next couple of quarters, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Friday (Feb 14). The current outbreak is ""very intense"", he said. He noted the economies of the region are much more interlinked now than when Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) hit 17 years ago, noting the much bigger role played by China in the region now.    ""I can't say whether we will have a recession or not,"" said Mr Lee. ""It's possible, but definitely our economy will take a hit."" The Prime Minister noted that in a message to the country last week, he had said Singapore may eventually have to change its approach to tackling the virus should the number of confirmed cases continue to grow.   ""I don't think we've reached that point yet,"" he said. ""But it is an evolving situation. Every day brings new developments."" While numbers are high, recent cases have mostly been traceable, he noted. He added life here has to continue, even as the country has to make ""sensible judgements"" on the best course of action in tackling the virus. On whether Singapore must accept temperature screenings and other measures as the new normal, Mr Lee said how long such measures are required depends on how the outbreak develops in Singapore, the region and the rest of the world.   While Singapore was declared SARS-free in less than four months, the COVID-19 ""may not be so fast"", he said. ""It will eventually pass, and we will be back to normal, but I cannot say for sure how long it will take."" On the joint working committee between Malaysia and Singapore, Mr Lee said while the two are separate countries, they are ""one area"" from a public health perspective, noting the high traffic travelling back and forth between the two countries each day.   As such, Malaysia and Singapore had to work through the problem together, he said. Vietnam, as the current ASEAN chair, will also coordinate the group's response to the virus, he noted.   He noted a similar regional approach was taken during the SARS crisis. ""For us in Singapore, if the region has a problem it's going to be very, very difficult for Singapore to isolate ourselves and to keep the problem outside of our boundaries."" Mr Lee was speaking to the media on the sidelines of a visit to Changi Airport Terminal 3 on Friday.   Changi Airport is on the frontlines of the current coronavirus situation, said Mr Lee, noting the air travel industry has been badly hit, with fewer flights now. Accompanied by Senior Minister of State for Transport and Health Lam Pin Min, he met with various members of the airport's staff, including baggage handlers, check-in staff and immigration officers.

""Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases,"" MOH said in a press release. This brings the total number of cases in Singapore to 58. Five of the new cases are linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster, while two are linked to the cluster at Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site. One of the new cases is a family member of a DBS employee, who tested positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday. Contact tracing is under way for the other seven locally transmitted cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to mainland China.   FIVE NEW CASES LINKED TO CHURCH Cases 51, 53, 54, 57 and 58 are all linked to the cluster associated with the Grace Assembly of God churches, where there have been two previously confirmed cases (48 and 49). The five new cases have no recent travel history to China. CASE 51 Case 51 is a 48-year-old Singaporean man who developed symptoms on Feb 4 and sought treatment at a GP clinic on Feb 5 and Feb 10. He went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 11 and was tested positive for the coronavirus a day later. Prior to hospital admission, he went to work at the Tanglin and Bukit Batok branches of the church. He stays at Bishan St 13. CASE 53 Case 53 is a 54-year-old Singaporean man who reported symptoms on Feb 10 and went to NCID two days later. He was tested positive for the coronavirus on the same day. Prior to being admitted to hospital, he mostly stayed at home at Hillview Avenue, MOH said. He works at the National University of Singapore but had not interacted with students and colleagues after the onset of symptoms. CASES 54, 57 and 58 A 54-year-old Singaporean woman (Case 54), a 26-year-old Singaporean man (Case 57) and a 55-year-old Singaporean man (Case 58) are all linked to the cluster at the churches. They were confirmed to have the coronavirus on Thursday morning and are warded in separate isolation rooms at NCID. No more information was given about their movements prior to hospital admission. TWO NEW CASES LINKED TO CONSTRUCTION SITE Two of the new patients ˚Ä˚ cases 52 and 56 ˚Ä˚ are linked to the cluster at Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site, where there have been two previously confirmed cases. Both new cases have no recent travel history to China. CASE 52 Case 52 is a 37-year-old Bangladesh national who is a Singapore work pass holder. He reported the onset of symptoms on Feb 7 and was identified as a close contact to cases 42 and 47, who worked at the construction site. On Feb 11, he was taken by ambulance to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where he tested positive for the coronavirus a day later. Prior to hospital admission, he had gone to work at the construction site. He reported he had mostly stayed at his rental apartment in Campbell Lane since the onset of symptoms. CASE 56 Case 56 is a 30-year-old Bangladesh national who was confirmed to have the COVID-19 infection on Thursday morning. He is currently warded at NCID. No other information about his movements prior to hospital admission has been announced. DBS EMPLOYEE AND FAMILY MEMBER CASE 55 One of the new cases, case 55, is a 30-year-old Singaporean with no recent travel history to China. He is a family member of case 50, a DBS employee who tested positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday. On Thursday, case 55 was tested positive for the infection and is currently warded at NCID. MOH provided more information on Thursday about the DBS employee. Case 50 is a 62-year-old Singaporean man with no recent travel history to China. He had reported symptoms on Feb 7 and went to two GP clinics on Feb 7, Feb 10 and Feb 11. He was admitted to NCID on Feb 11 and tested positive for the infection on Feb 12. Prior to hospital admission, he had gone to work at DBS Asia Central at Marina Bay Financial Centre in 12 Marina Boulevard. He had also stayed at his home in Mei Hwan Drive other than to seek medical treatment. On Thursday, MOH said case 44 ÅEÄÅE a Certis Cisco officer who served quarantine orders on two ""ple from Wuhan - was ""a contact of cases 13 and 26"". Case 13 was a 73-year-old woman from Wuhan who had arrived in on Jan 21, the same day as her daughter, who was case 26. It is unclear if the Certis Cisco officer served quarantine orders on cases 13 and 26. Besides the clusters linked to Grace Assembly of God and the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site, MOH has identified three other clusters and possible clusters. Three of the previous cases - cases 30, 36 and 39 - are linked to a private business meeting at Grand Hyatt Singapore from Jan 20 to Jan 22. The meeting is also linked to several other cases in Malaysia, South Korean and Britian. A possible cluster of five cases - cases 8, 9, 31, 33 and 38 - is linked to The Life Church and Missions Singapore at 146B Paya Lebar Road.

The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) has said it will waive licence fees for hotels, travel agents and tour guides, as well as defray the cleaning costs of hotels that accommodated confirmed and suspected cases of the virus. STB said on Tuesday that the tourism sector will take a ˚Ä˚significant hit˚Ä˚ due to the outbreak, with visitor arrivals estimated to tumble by 25 to 30 per cent this year. The Government has also said it is expecting a knock-on impact on related industries and firms, adding that it is prepared to support companies and workers in the event of a broad-based slowdown in the com""ng months.

Global concern remains high about the spread of the virus, which first emerged in China's central Hubei province in December, with the first death outside Asia reported in France this weekend. The death toll jumped to 1,665 in mainland China on Sunday after 142 more people died from the virus. More than 68,000 people have now been infected - but the number of new cases of the COVID-19 strain continued to decline. In hardest-hit Hubei, the number of new cases slowed for a third consecutive day and at 139, the number of deaths was level with Saturday's toll. The number of new cases in other parts of the country has dropped for twelve straight days. The WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned however that it was ""impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". ""We ask all governments, companies, and news organisations to work with us to sound the appropriate level of alarm without fanning the flames of hysteria,"" he said, speaking at the Munich Security Conference. ""China has bought the world time. We don't know how much time."" The UN health body has asked China for more details on how diagnoses are being made. An international team of WHO experts will arrive in Beijing this weekend for a joint mission with Chinese counterparts. QUARANTINED CRUISE SHIP The scale of the epidemic ballooned on Thursday after authorities in Hubei changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding thousands of new patients to their tally. Hubei added more than 14,000 cases in a single day after officials there started counting people clinically diagnosed through lung imaging, in addition to those with a positive lab test result. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. Local authorities around the country have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading. Beijing's municipal government has enacted a rule requiring all people coming to the capital to quarantine themselves for 14 days, warning that violators would be punished, according to official media. Outside mainland China, an 80-year-old Chinese tourist in France was the fourth person to die from the new coronavirus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong and Japan. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship off Japan, with 335 infections now as dozens more cases were confirmed. A US State Department spokesperson said Americans stranded on the vessel would be evacuated, and would face a further quarantine of two weeks in the United States. Hong Kong authorities also announced it would charter a flight for city residents on the ship, who would stay at a quarantine centre for 14 days on their return. Several countries have banned arrivals from China and major airlines have cut services to the country. SOCIAL STABILITY The virus spread last month as millions travelled across the country for the Chinese New Year holiday, which was extended to try and prevent more infections. People have slowly started to return to work in the past two weeks, though many are doing their jobs from home and schools remain closed. With the government facing criticism over its handling of the crisis, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for tighter policing to protect social stability. The government must ""increase use of police force and strengthen the visible use of police"", to ensure stability during the crisis, Xi said in a February 3 speech published by state media on Saturday. China's central bank said it will also disinfect banknotes with ultraviolet light or high temperatures and store them for up to 14 days before they are put back into circulation.

12 Feb 2020 08:40PM,"COVID-19: Supply chain remains robust, 'panic buying' situation has stabilised, says Lawrence Wong","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The panic buying situation that was seen after Singapore raised its coronavirus risk assessment level last week has stabilised, although some outlets may not be fully stocked yet due to manpower and logistics issues, said Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong. Even so, Singapore's supply chain remains robust and the major retailers should resume ""normal stock levels in a day or two"", he said at a press conference on Wednesday (Feb 12). During the surge in demand, retailers had to move stock very quickly from the warehouse into their stores, he said. Many of them activated extra people to stock shelves and contracted additional logistics companies to support their operations, Mr Wong added. Many people had to work overtime as well in order to make sure shelves were restocked, said Mr Wong, as he thanked those involved for stepping up their response.  Last week, Singapore raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange after clusters of the coronavirus surfaced locally. This prompted a ""wave of panic buying"", said Mr Wong. Stores in Singapore saw a sudden surge in demand for groceries, leaving some shops temporarily out of stock. But the fact that Singapore was able to meet that sudden demand proves that its diversification strategy is able to protect the system from any sudden shocks, Mr Wong said.  ""So we just want to continue to assure Singaporeans that our supply chains, when it comes to food and grocery items, remain robust. Our diversification strategy ensures that we are protected from any sudden shocks,"" he said. ""We were able to meet that demand. It was simply a matter of getting the supplies out from the warehouse into the retail outlets, and the supply chain that we have remain robust,"" he added. PANIC ""SPREADS FASTER"" ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAN THE TRUTH Authorities can understand why people were concerned and anxious, said the minister, but the response from the public last week demonstrates the challenges in conveying ""accurate information"" to the public in such situations. ""When we went around asking, there was some misunderstanding, or even a lack of clarity around what was going on, what DORSCON Orange meant, despite our best efforts at explaining to all of you,"" he told reporters. ""We briefed editors beforehand, but you know, in times like this, it just goes to show how challenging it is to get accurate information out,"" he said. ""In today's world of social media, fear, uncertainty and panic spreads a lot faster on social media than the truth, which is boring and nobody wants to share."" The authorities will ""double down"" on efforts to ""continue to push out information in a timely manner"". ""We are doing daily briefings now to the media. We hope all of you will help us too, to get the information across,"" he told reporters.  The Government will disseminate any information it has that is ""relevant and useful"", said the minister. However, if it is something it does not know about or is unable to make an accurate assessment of, ""we will have to be honest and we will tell you that we do not know,"" he added. He gave the example of people asking how the novel coronavirus situation will unfold in the coming days and weeks. ""The honest answer is ÅEÄÅE it is still too early to tell,""aid Mr Wong. ""We really can't say whether it will get better, whether it will get worse, what sort of situation is going to unfold."" As Singapore steps up its surveillance and does more testing of cases, the country can expect to see more cases coming up ""in the coming days and weeks"", he said. DON'T SPECULATE ABOUT WHETHER DORSCON WILL CHANGE COLOUR The minister also spoke about the DORSCON framework, saying that people should not speculate about when the colour-coded framework will change. ""Let's not get into this thing about speculating, anticipating, worrying whether it's going to turn from Orange to Red, which I think to some extent happened when it went from Yellow to Orange, and then it created that sense of panic and concern,"" he said.  The focus instead should be on the measures put in place, because each colour can contain a range of measures. ""We are in Orange, and within Orange we can put in place a whole range of measures that are more than what we have today,"" he said. Singapore authorities on Wednesday confirmed three new cases of the novel coronavirus, taking the total number of people who have tested positive in Singapore to 50.

The Malaysian Health Ministry said in a statement that the patient, who is 83 years old, was among the passengers aboard a cruise that docked in Cambodia on Thursday. ÅEÄÅEThe Cambodian government allowed all passengers and crew members to return to their home countries after announcing that health screening had been carried out on them,ÅEÄÅE said Health director-general Noor Hisham Abdullah. Out of the 145 passengers of the said cruise who flew to Malaysia on Friday, the woman and her husband were found to be symptomatic upon arrival at Kuala Lumpur International Airport and were referred to the Sungai Buloh Hospital for further checks, he said. The patient tested positive for COVID-19 on Saturday and is now in a stable condition, said Dr Noor Hisham. The test result for her 85-year-old husband, meanwhile, was negative. He is being warded and observed at the same hospital, Dr Noor Hisham added. This brings the total number of confirmed cases in Malaysia to 22. The statement did not specify which cruise liner the woman had travelled on. There have been instances of cruise ships stuck at the sea since the virus outbreak triggered fears of a gl""pandemic. A Princess Cruise LineÅEÄÅEs ship, the Diamond Princess, has become the largest single cluster of cases outside China, with more than 200 people tested positive for the virus.

14 Feb 2020 06:12AM,Commentary: Fighting fear is key part in battling COVID-19,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners A perceived lack of transparency and accountability has seen governments around the world deal with trust issues as they tackle the outbreak, says Eugene K B Tan. SINGAPORE: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak will eventually come to an end ˚Ä˚ hopefully sooner rather than later. But the impact of the outbreak, be it to governments, healthcare systems, the economy, people˚Ä˚s lives, may linger for some time to come. However, as countries endeavour to deal with the public health threat, they will also have to inspire and provide confidence that they (and the people) are equal to the task. Unfortunately, fear of the virus has spread faster than the virus itself. SELF-CENTRED ATTITUDES IN SINGAPORE In Singapore, this has resulted in people engaging in self-centred or irrational behaviour, which often make matters worse. The irresponsible use of social media has given virility to fear and panic. Notwithstanding the valiant efforts by frontline healthcare, security, and other professionals, a foreboding sense of dread or even apocalyptic premonition appears to have developed over the outbreak. For example, last weekend we saw people heading in droves to supermarkets to panic buy and hoard basic necessities and essentials. Face masks, bread, rice, formula milk, instant noodles, and even toilet paper, were some of the more coveted items. Besides the panic-buying, some Singaporeans also felt entitled to frown upon nurses in their uniforms using public transport. A social media post by Education Minister Ong Ye Kung on Feb 10 pointed out that people were also shunning Victoria Junior College students in uniforms because one of its teachers was recently reported infected with the coronavirus.   Such social distancing measures are not only socially irresponsible but will fuel exclusionary and dehumanising responses against certain groups. Previously, it was xenophobic reactions to mainland Chinese in our midst; now, it˚Ä˚s nurses using public transport and refusing to serve students. Might others in the frontline combating the outbreak and those who recover from the virus be next? PUBLIC CONFIDENCE LOST ELSEWHERE Elsewhere in the world, there have been examples of what can happen when there is a lack of general trust in efforts to address the outbreak. In China, public trust in the management of the threat is critically low primarily due to an initial cover-up by the provincial authorities. Not only was precious time lost in preventing the spread but it accelerated many more infections within and without China. There remain concerns China has been vastly undercounting cases of the virus. Dr Li Wenliang, the whistleblower doctor in Wuhan, had in December last year first raised a red-flag on a mysterious virus infecting people in the city but was quickly silenced. He had said in a subsequent interview: If the officials had disclosed information about the epidemic earlier ... I think it would have been a lot better. There should be more openness and transparency. Similarly, distrust in the Hong Kong government˚Ä˚s strategy prompted protests and strikes by healthcare workers to demand full border closure with the mainland to stem the infections. In South Korea, the not-in-my-backyard attitudes have emerged as residents in two towns protested when the government planned to quarantine Korean evacuees from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, in their towns. This was primarily because of poor initial communication by the government in explaining the rationale of the move and to assure residents that their safety is of priority.   Such protests also emerged in Natuna in Indonesia where the country has quarantined about 280 citizens and flight crew evacuated from Wuhan. It did not help matters that the Indonesian Health Minister˚Ä˚s claims that the country has taken all the precautions needed to maintain zero cases was met with wide public ridicule, cynicism and disbelief. The government˚Ä˚s nonchalance has raised severe doubts whether it is ready to tackle the virus. THE CURIOUS CASE OF SINGAPORE As such, the reaction of Singaporeans in these aspects is curious. The Government here has done relatively well in keeping communications open and fluid. Press conferences helmed by the multi-agency task force chairs, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, have provided important information and timely updates. Pre-emptive measures and swift and decisive action were and are being taken to manage the public health threat. There has also been transparency. Collectively, they provide stability and normalcy amid a rapidly evolving situation. The number of cases in Singapore appear relatively high given the aggressive and methodical approach to detecting cases. Trust that the healthcare system is well prepared, coupled with free medical treatment for those infected with the virus and financially assisting those in isolation have incentivised those unwell to come forward. The containment of clusters of local transmission has helped prevent the virus from spreading. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted in his remarks to the nation last Saturday that the current outbreak may morph into widespread infection. But he also used his speech, in Malay, English and Mandarin, to calm the palpable public fear and assure Singaporeans that Singapore is prepared for the outbreak. He also contextualised this outbreak against other outbreaks in the past.   Government leaders have also come out firmly to caution against unsavoury behaviour. When the panic-buying began last Friday afternoon, several leaders had come out that evening to urge calm, explain and provide assurance that national stockpiles of essential items like rice are plenty. Supermarkets also quickly followed up and replenished stocks to assure Singaporeans that there is enough for everyone without hoarding. And when assurances werenÅEÄÅEt enough, NTUC supermarkets imposed purchase controls on some key items to prevent over-buying. Many of SingaporeÅEÄÅEs leaders, like Ministers Chan Chun Sing, Desmond Lee, Masagoes Zulkifli, Ong Ye Kung and K Shanmugam, have also called out inappropriate behaviour of shunning healthcare workers and students or engaging in xenophobia. Where needed and relevant, the Government has also used the legal tools at its disposal to thwart profiteering, disinformation and divisive comments. The fear and anxiety among ""poreans has probably little to do with a lack of trust and confidence in SingaporeÅEÄÅEs ability to fight. It is perhaps more the belief that individual self-help, on top of governmentÅEÄÅEs efforts, is preferred. Perhaps memories of the SARS episode of 2003 may have returned to instil fear. Or perhaps the fact that the virus cannot seem to be localised, contained, and is spreading means that fear is being continually stoked. But one canÅEÄÅEt levy too much blame on Singaporeans for this fear. After all, not much is still known of the virus and it was only around the Chinese New Year period that its severity dawned on us. To keep things in perspective, it is worth noting that there have been 15 million cases and 8,200 deaths worldwide",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/fear-and-panic-singapore-wuhan-virus-12425832
18 Feb 2020 06:05PM,COVID-19 in Malaysia: List of patients who have recovered,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners KUALA LUMPUR: Fifteen COVID-19 patients in Malaysia have been discharged from hospital after making a full recovery, as of Wednesday (Feb 19). Ten of them are Chinese nationals while five are Malaysians. The total number of confirmed cases in Malaysia is 22 so far. The foreign patients were cleared for return to their home country, and will be subject to medical screening by the Chinese authorities once they land in China. Earlier, a spokesperson from Malaysia's Health Ministry said its Chinese counterpart will then share their latest condition with Malaysia. Here is what we know about the discharged cases: CASE 6 Who: A four-year-old girl from Guangdong, China. She was discharged from Langkawi˚Ä˚s Sultanah Maliha Hospital on Feb 4.   Details: Together with her parents and younger sister, the girl arrived at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Jan 20 and travelled to Langkawi on Jan 24. Both children developed fever, cough and flu, and sought medical treatment at the hospital on Jan 26. She tested positive for the novel coronavirus on Jan 28 and was treated in an isolation ward, while the test result was negative for her sister. Subsequently, during the treatment phase, two clinical samples were taken and she tested negative for the virus. She was the first novel coronavirus patient in Malaysia to make a full recovery. The ministry said her case proved that those infected may be treated and it was possible for patients to recover completely, as reported among many other cases in China. ˚Ä˚Many believe that this virus would be fatal to those infected but this is not accurate,˚Ä˚ the ministry said in a statement. Malaysian media reported that the girl and her family have flown back to Guangzhou.   CASE 4 Who: A 40-year-old man from Wuhan, China. He was discharged from Johor˚Ä˚s Permai Hospital on Feb 8. Details: He arrived in Johor Bahru on Jan 22 after travelling by bus from Singapore. The bus carried 17 tourists including the man˚Ä˚s wife and child, authorities said. He developed a fever on Jan 23 and was warded the next day for high fever and pneumonia. His condition worsened the next day, and he required additional oxygen support. The Crisis Preparedness and Response Centre received a report on Jan 25 that he tested positive for the coronavirus. The hospital began treating him with antiviral medicine Kaletra, an HIV drug, on Jan 28. After eight days of treatment, the patient˚Ä˚s condition improved and he fully recovered. He tested negative three times for the novel coronavirus and was discharged. CASE 10 Who: A 63-year-old man from Wuhan, China. He was discharged from Kuala Lumpur Hospital on Feb 9. Details: The man arrived in Malaysia via Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Jan 18. He was down with light fever on Jan 23 and received outpatient treatment in a private hospital in Kuala Lumpur. His case was referred to the Health Ministry and he was placed under home surveillance for 14 days. He was sent to Kuala Lumpur Hospital as his fever persisted. He tested positive on Feb 3. He was stable and received symptomatic treatment and continuous monitoring. He did not require antiviral medication. Health Director-General Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah confirmed he tested negative for the virus on two tests conducted on Feb 7 and Feb 8.  CASE 1 Who: An 11-year-old boy from Wuhan, China. He was discharged from Sungai Buloh Hospital on Feb 14, along with his three other family members - his grandmother, mother and brother. Details: The boy is part of the same family of eight Chinese nationals who were in close contact with the first person to test positive for the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore. The family had travelled from Guangzhou to Singapore on Jan 20. Two members of the family, a 66-year-old man and his son, showed symptoms and were tested positive for the virus in Singapore on Jan 23. Singapore's Health Ministry then alerted its Malaysian counterparts that the man's wife, daughter-in-law, two grandchildren and another family of four had made their way to Johor Bahru. This allowed authorities to reach out to the eight family members and isolate them in a hotel in Johor Bahru. They were later transferred to Sungai Buloh Hospital for COVID-19 tests. Cases 1, 2 and 3 were confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 by Malaysia authorities on Jan 25. CASE 2 Who: A two-year-old boy from Wuhan, China. He was discharged from Sungai Buloh Hospital on Feb 14. Details: He is the grandchild of Case 3 and brother to Case 1. CASE 3 Who: A 65-year-old woman from Wuhan, China.

19 Feb 2020 04:11AM,China sees fall in COVID-19 deaths as WHO urges caution,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: China reported its fewest new coronavirus infections since January on Tuesday (Feb 18) and its lowest daily death toll for a week, but the World Health Organization said data suggesting the epidemic had slowed should still be viewed with caution. The head of a leading hospital in China's central city of Wuhan, epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, died of the disease, becoming one of the most prominent victims since the disease first appeared at the end of last year. Illustrating the impact of the outbreak on worldwide growth and corporate profits, oil prices tumbled and equity markets slid after Apple Inc issued a revenue warning due to the disruption the disease is causing to global supply chains. Chinese officials reported 1,886 new cases - the first time the daily figure has fallen below 2,000 since Jan 30 - bringing the mainland China total to 72,436. A figure of 98 new deaths marked the first time the daily toll in China had fallen below 100 since Feb 11, bringing the total to 1,868.   World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Chinese data ""appears to show a decline in new cases"" but any apparent trend ""must be interpreted very cautiously"". Outside China, there have been 827 cases of COVID-19 and five deaths, according to a Reuters count based on official statements. More than half of those cases have been on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan. Tedros said there had been 92 cases of human-to-human spread of the coronavirus in 12 countries outside China but the WHO did not have the data to make meaningful comparisons to what was going on in China. ""We have not seen sustained local transmission of coronavirus except in specific circumstances like the Diamond Princess cruise ship,"" he said. China says figures indicating a slowdown in new cases in recent days show that aggressive steps it has taken to curb travel and commerce are slowing the spread of the disease beyond central Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan.   The WHO's Mike Ryan said China had had success with ""putting out the fire"" first in Hubei and ensuring that people returning to Beijing from the Lunar New Year holiday are monitored. The numbers appear encouraging, said Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Britain's University of Edinburgh, who described himself as cautious. ""Though it is unrealistic to reduce the transmission rate to zero it may have been reduced to a level where the epidemic is brought under control,"" Woolhouse said. ""It may be that the epidemic is simply running its natural course, and is starting to run out of new people to infect. It could also be that the unprecedented public health measures introduced in China are having the desired effect."" Chinese state television said Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuhan Wuchang Hospital, died on Tuesday, the seventh health worker to fall victim. The hospital was designated solely for treating virus-infected patients. GLOBAL REPERCUSSIONS Despite global concerns about the economic impact of the disease, China's ambassador to the European Union said on Tuesday this would be ""limited, short-term and manageable"" and that Beijing had enough resources to step in if needed. Chinese state television quoted President Xi Jinping as saying China could still meet its economic growth target for 2020 despite the epidemic. Economists are warning of potential mass layoffs in China later this year if the virus is not contained soon. ""The employment situation is OK in the first quarter, but if the virus is not contained by end-March, then from the second quarter, we'll see a big round of layoffs,"" said Dan Wang, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). Job losses could run as high as 4.5 million, he forecast. Britain's biggest car manufacturer, Jaguar Land Rover, has flown Chinese parts in suitcases to Britain to maintain production and could run out after two weeks because of the coronavirus. Components made in China are used in millions of vehicles assembled around the world and Hubei province is a major hub for vehicle parts production and shipments. South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the economy there was in an emergency situation and required stimulus as the epidemic had disrupted demand for South Korean goods. Ryan said the WHO had ""prioritised supplies"" of protective equipment for reclusive North Korea, which is technically still at war with the South after their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, at the same time as saying there was no indication of any coronavirus cases there. Singapore announced a S$4 billion financial package to help contain the outbreak and weather its economic impact. Japan, where the economy was already shrinking and the epidemic has created fears of recession, the spread of the virus has prompted Tokyo to put limits on public crowds while some companies are telling employees to work from home. And, starting on Thursday, Russia will suspend entry of Chinese citizens for employment, private, educational and tourist purposes, health authorities said, adding that the move would be temporary.

18 Feb 2020 08:24PM,"Philippine workers allowed to travel to Hong Kong, Macau amid COVID-19 fear","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners MANILA: The Philippines on Tuesday (Feb 18) allowed Filipino workers to travel to Hong Kong and Macau, relaxing the travel ban it imposed on China and its special administrative regions to control the spread of the coronavirus. The Philippines announced its decision before Hong Kong reported that a Filipina domestic helper became its 61st case of coronavirus in the country. There are more than 180,000 Filipinos in Hong Kong, many working as helpers, according to the Philippines Labour Ministry. The Philippines had imposed a travel ban on China and its special administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau. It later included Taiwan in the ban, but lifted it a few days after. There was no immediate comment from Philippine officials on how the latest development in Hong Kong will affect its decision to relax its travel restriction. The Philippines also said it would allow foreign spouses or children of Filipinos and holders of diplomatic visas travelling from China, Macau and Hong Kong to enter the country but they will be subjected to a 14-day quarantine. Initially, only Filipinos and holders of permanent resident visas travelling from these areas were allowed entry. Recruiters have appealed to the government to exempt Filipino workers from the travel ban because many of them are breadwinners. They could also lose their visas if they failed to report for work on time, the Society of Hong Kong Accredited Recruiters of the Philippines has said. In 2019, Filipino workers in Hong Kong sent home US$801 million in foreign exchange remittances, central bank data showed. Filipinos leaving for Hong Kong and Macau for study and employment will be required to sign a declaration that they know the risks of going there, health officials said. The Philippine government also said it will repatriate Filipino crew and passengers from the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess who wish to come home. The cruise ship, owned by Carnival Corp and carrying some 3,700 passengers and crew, has been quarantined in Yokohama since Feb. 3, after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong before it travelled to Japan was diagnosed with the virus. The Philippine Foreign Ministry said 35 of the 538 Filipinos onboard had tested positive for the coronavirus, including the eight new cases, who are all crew members. In the Philippines, there have been three confirmed cases of coronavirus, including one death.

18 Feb 2020 06:07AM,COVID-19 outbreak: What you need to know about the Public Health Preparedness Clinics,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: About 900 general practitioner (GP) clinics will be reactivated as Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) starting Tuesday (Feb 18), to care for patients with respiratory symptoms in light of the COVID-19 outbreak. The Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Friday that it expects the number of confirmed cases in Singapore to increase, partly due to the enhanced disease surveillance. ˚Ä˚We are quite concerned that many of the local confirmed cases have remained in the community and some have gone back to work even when they were ill and even after they have seen a doctor. This is not helpful in our efforts to reduce the risk of community transmission,˚Ä˚ Health Minister Gan Kim Yong had said on Friday. What makes these clinics different and where can you find them? Here˚Ä˚s what you need to know: WHAT ARE PHPCS The PHPCs are ˚Ä˚an important line of defence˚Ä˚ during public health outbreaks, Mr Gan had said. The activation of PHPCs and polyclinics would allow the virus to be detected in patients earlier and reduce the risk of further transmission, according to the Health Ministry. The PHPCs, which provide subsidised treatment and medication during public health outbreaks, were previously activated to deal with haze and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. The clinics are familiar with the appropriate care protocols according to the assessed risk and diagnosis of each patient, and will be supplied with the necessary personal protective equipment, said the ministry. From Tuesday, about 900 clinics will be ÅEÄÅEprogressively activatedÅEÄÅE to care for patients with respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat and runny nose. These clinics will also help refer pat"" to a hospital if they are suspected to have pneumonia.   WHERE ARE THE CLINICS? The clinics can be identified by a PHPC decal, and members of the public can find an updated list of PHPCs at https://www.flugowhere.gov.sg from Tuesday. GPs undergo a ÅEÄÅEprocess of enrolmentÅEÄÅE when they apply to join the PHPC scheme, said MOHÅEÄÅEs director of medical services Kenneth Mak on Friday. This includes teaching them the importance of infection control and training them to use personal protective equipment. ""ere is a little bit more work done in order to make sure they are better prepared to deal with patients that have infectious diseases,"" added Associate Professor Mak. ""It is not that ordinary GPs cannot manage such conditions, but these GPs (PHPCs) have been given additional training, additional preparation that they've done such that in times like this, we have a ready group of doctors and their clinics who are able to stand up and then further support as we then manage an outbreak in a crisis."" WHO SHOULD GO TO PHPCS Patients with respiratory symptoms, such as fever, cough, sore throat and runny nose should visit PHPCs. These clinics will provide special subsidies for those diagnosed with respiratory symptoms, to encourage those who are ill to seek treatment, said MOH. Patients with such symptoms can also go to polyclinics, where the subsidies will also apply.   Singapore citizens and permanent residents diagnosed with respiratory illnesses at the PHPCs and polyclinics will pay a flat subsidised rate of S$10 for their consultation and treatment. Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation seniors will pay S$5. The ministry also advised patients to return to the same doctor to seek further treatment if their symptoms persist or deteriorate. ""Patients must recognise the importance of staying home when unwell,"" it said in a media release on Friday. ""Mixing in large crowds, or continuing to go to work or school when ill, even with mild symptoms, will put others at risk."" WHY THE NEED FOR 5-DAYS MC In light of the COVID-19 outbreak, healthcare professionals have also been advised to provide medical certificates (MCs) of five days for patients with respiratory symptoms. Patients will be referred for further medical assessment and tests if they do not recover within five days, said the ministry. Most patients with respiratory symptoms are not infected with COVID-19, noted the health ministry, but extra precautions must be taken. MOH stressed that anyone with respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat and runny nose should seek medical treatment early and stay home throughout their illness. ""We urge all individuals and employers to cooperate and follow strictly the five-day MC regime that has been put in place."" Addressing the five-day period, Assoc Prof Mak explained on Friday that the majority of patients with respiratory problems will recover within three to four days. ""Most people with minor conditions would have recovered by then, and it (five days) allows us to look and determine whether there ",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/covid-19-phpc-public-health-clinic-need-to-know-subsidies-where-12441664
18 Feb 2020 12:55PM,Singapore Airlines to cut flights as COVID-19 outbreak hits demand,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore Airlines (SIA) will temporarily cut flights across its global network in the three months to May, it said on Tuesday (Feb 18), as a coronavirus epidemic hits demand for services to the Asian city state, as well as through the key transit hub. In the announcement published on its website, SIA provided a link to the list of flights that will be affected by the decision. Key affected destinations include Frankfurt, Jakarta, London, Los Angeles, Mumbai, Paris, Seoul, Sydney and Tokyo, the airline said. ""Singapore Airlines and SilkAir will temporarily reduce services across our network due to weak demand as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak,"" the carrier said. ""We will continue to monitor the situation and make further adjustments as necessary."" The airline added that affected customers will be ""notified and re-accommodated onto other flights. ""If you have booked your tickets through a travel agency, please contact your agent for assistance. If you have booked your tickets directly with Singapore Airlines, please contact the SIA reservations team at (+65) 6223-8888 if you need any assistance,"" the airline said. The cuts follow major reductions already announced in services to mainland China and Hong Kong. In the Dec quarter, flights to mainland China made up 11 per cent of capacity for the airline, and more than that for budget arm Scoot. ""It's not a surprise to see some cuts in flights, given the weak forward bookings that can be expected from the current environment,"" said DBS analyst Paul Yong. Demand on flights to South Korea and Japan had been hit hardest after China, Yong quoted Singapore Airlines' management team as having told analysts at a results briefing on Monday. Those were the areas of the biggest cutbacks in Tuesday's announcement. Singapore's tally of 77 cases of the virus is one of the highest outside mainland China, where more than 1,800 people have been killed in the epidemic. Last week, the Asian tourism and travel hub said it expected visitor numbers to drop by a quarter or more this year, hit by the virus outbreak. Besides visitors to the city-state, Singapore Airlines also relies heavily on transit traffic. Premium travel has suffered after many business events were cancelled across Asia because of the virus. Hong Kong-based rival Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd has said it is cutting 40 per cent of capacity across its network, up from 30 per cent earlier, due to weak demand.

The head of a leading hospital in China's central city of Wuhan, epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, died of the disease, becoming one of the most prominent victims since the disease first appeared at the end of last year. Illustrating the impact of the outbreak on worldwide growth and corporate profits, oil prices tumbled and equity markets slid after Apple Inc issued a revenue warning due to the disruption the disease is causing to global supply chains. Chinese officials reported 1,886 new cases - the first time the daily figure has fallen below 2,000 since Jan 30 - bringing the mainland China total to 72,436. A figure of 98 new deaths marked the first time the daily toll in China had fallen below 100 since Feb 11, bringing the total to 1,868.   World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Chinese data ""appears to show a decline in new cases"" but any apparent trend ""must be interpreted very cautiously"". Outside China, there have been 827 cases of COVID-19 and five deaths, according to a Reuters count based on official statements. More than half of those cases have been on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan. Tedros said there had been 92 cases of human-to-human spread of the coronavirus in 12 countries outside China but the WHO did not have the data to make meaningful comparisons to what was going on in China. ""We have not seen sustained local transmission of coronavirus except in specific circumstances like the Diamond Princess cruise ship,"" he said. China says figures indicating a slowdown in new cases in recent days show that aggressive steps it has taken to curb travel and commerce are slowing the spread of the disease beyond central Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan.   The WHO's Mike Ryan said China had had success with ""putting out the fire"" first in Hubei and ensuring that people returning to Beijing from the Lunar New Year holiday are monitored. The numbers appear encouraging, said Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Britain's University of Edinburgh, who described himself as cautious. ""Though it is unrealistic to reduce the transmission rate to zero it may have been reduced to a level where the epidemic is brought under control,"" Woolhouse said. ""It may be that the epidemic is simply running its natural course, and is starting to run out of new people to infect. It could also be that the unprecedented public health measures introduced in China are having the desired effect."" Chinese state television said Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuhan Wuchang Hospital, died on Tuesday, the seventh health worker to fall victim. The hospital was designated solely for treating virus-infected patients. GLOBAL REPERCUSSIONS Despite global concerns about the economic impact of the disease, China's ambassador to the European Union said on Tuesday this would be ""limited, short-term and manageable"" and that Beijing had enough resources to step in if needed. Chinese state television quoted President Xi Jinping as saying China could still meet its economic growth target for 2020 despite the epidemic. Economists are warning of potential mass layoffs in China later this year if the virus is not contained soon. ""The employment situation is OK in the first quarter, but if the virus is not contained by end-March, then from the second quarter, we'll see a big round of layoffs,"" said Dan Wang, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). Job losses could run as high as 4.5 million, he forecast. Britain's biggest car manufacturer, Jaguar Land Rover, has flown Chinese parts in suitcases to Britain to maintain production and could run out after two weeks because of the coronavirus. Components made in China are used in millions of vehicles assembled around the world and Hubei province is a major hub for vehicle parts production and shipments. South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the economy there was in an emergency situation and required stimulus as the epidemic had disrupted demand for South Korean goods. Ryan said the WHO had ""prioritised supplies"" of protective equipment for reclusive North Korea, which is technically still at war with the South after their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, at the same time as saying there was no indication of any coronavirus cases there. Singapore announced a S$4 billion financial package to help contain the outbreak and weather its economic impact. Japan, where the economy was already shrinking and the epidemic has created fears of recession, the spread of the virus has prompted Tokyo to put limits on public crowds while some companies are telling employees to work from home. And, starting on Thursday, Russia will suspend entry of Chinese citizens for employment, private, educational and tourist purposes, health authorities said, adding that the move would be temporary.

19 Feb 2020 10:29AM,Hong Kong reports second COVID-19 death,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners HONG KONG: Hong Kong recorded its second death caused by the new coronavirus on Wednesday (Feb 19). The 70-year-old man, who had underlying illnesses, was one of the 62 confirmed cases in the city, said a spokesperson from Princess Margaret Hospital. The spokesperson added that the elderly man's condition had deteriorated before he died at the hospital on Wednesday morning. Hong Kong officials said the man was taken to hospital on Feb 12 after a fall at home. He had a fever and tested positive for the coronavirus before he died a week later. The city's first fatality from COVID-19 was a 39-year-old man who had travelled to Wuhan in January. Officials said the man also had diabetes, but had been stable until his condition suddenly deteriorated before he died on Feb 4. The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped past 2,000 on Wednesday after 136 more people died. This brings the total number of confirmed cases in mainland China to 74,185. Hong Kong is on edge over the coronavirus partly because of its own tragic history of experiencing a deadly disease. In 2003, 299 Hong Kongers were killed by an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - 40 per cent of the global total fatalities. In the last fortnight, the international business hub has been hit by a wave of panic-buying, with supermarket shelves emptied of staple goods such as toilet paper, hand sanitiser and rice. Authorities say the supply of goods remains stable and says panic-buying is itself causing shortages. Face masks, however, remain in short supply with queues cropping up across the city whenever a local pharmacy or store announces a new delivery.

14 Feb 2020 09:27PM,"'Clearly emerging' that COVID-19 is different from SARS, more similarities to H1N1: Lawrence Wong","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: It is ""clearly emerging"" that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said on Friday (Feb 14). The COVID-19 fatality rate in China is lower than SARS, said Mr Wong, but it is more infectious and may spread at a faster rate than SARS. Over the past week, the multi-ministry taskforce dealing with the COVID-19 situation in Singapore has learnt more about the nature of COVID-19 based on emerging trends in China and around the world, and also based on research by experts. Mr Wong said COVID-19 is ""different in several ways"" from SARS.  COVID-19 TRANSMISSION, FATALITY RATE DIFFERENT FROM SARS ""The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,"" said the minister. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he said. Like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild, the researchers found. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like influenza, can spread ""quite quickly"", said the minister. ""With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down ÅEÄÅE we continue going out even though we donÅEÄÅEt really feel well, and thatÅEÄÅEs how the virus transmits,""id. The other difference between COVID-19 and SARS is the severity, he said, adding that the fatality rate in China for COVID-19 is lower than SARS. ""Outside of Hubei province in China, it is even lower. Outside of China, it is low too. So mortality rates are lower than SARS,"" he said. The fatality rate of SARS globally during the 2002-2003 outbreak was 9.56 per cent, as compared to a 2.14 per cent fatality rate for COVID-19 so far. The SARS outbreak led to 774 deaths out of 8,098 cases, according to figures from the World Health Organization (WHO), while COVID-19 has so far killed at least 1,380 people out of about 64,400 cases. He cited a study by the WHO based on 17,000 patients, which found that 82 per cent had ""mild symptoms"", 15 per cent severe symptoms and 3 per cent had critical symptoms. ""It is not a mild illness at all, but certainly not of the severity of SARS. These are the facts that we know about COVID-19 today,"" Mr Wong said. Because of the ""higher degree of infection"", experts believe COVID-19 may spread at a much faster rate than SARS, which means COVID-19 is more similar to H1N1. COVID-19 STRATEGY COULD CHANGE If there is evidence of widespread community transmission in Singapore, Mr Wong said the Government could change its strategy on fighting the virus. For instance, it could stop contact tracing because the large numbers make it impractical, and start sending confirmed COVID-19 cases with mild symptoms home to recover in isolation. ""If that takes place, the same precautions and advice we give to patients now still must prevail,"" the Ministry of Health (MOH) director of medical services Kenneth Mak said. ""Such patients must stay at home, they must not mix with other people, they must not go into crowded places. ""Therefore, even if a person has an infection and even if he does well, the potential for him then to spread this to other people is then controlled."" Those who need more acute care ÅEÄÅE possibly because they are old and vulnerable or have mobility issues ÅEÄÅE can still be admitted to hospital. Associate Professor Mak said the Government will not decide on adopting this strategy solely based on the total number of confirmed cases. ""ÅEs actually on the basis of how we see each case arising, where we think the method of transmission is, whether it still remains confined perhaps within a cluster, whether itÅEÄÅEs possible still for us to ring fence and limit further spread within that cluster,"" explained. Until then, Mr Wong said the current strategy of contact tracing and containment remains ""relevant"" for Singapore, adding that other countries are also doing the same. ""But as I said, there is growing evidence about how transmissible it is, how difficult it is to detect because it is transmissible and infectious when symptoms are mild,"" he added. VIRUS MAY HAVE SPREAD UNDETECTED IN SOUTHEAST ASIA Given so, it could be that the disease may have spread undetected to other countries, said Mr Wong. ""Experts are already saying that that spread of the virus to other countries may already be happening, but itÅEÄÅEs undetected, particularly in Southeast Asia as well,""e said. Mr Wong cited a Harvard study that looked at airline travel volume which concluded that the virus may have spread undetected to various countries, including Indonesia and Thailand. Researchers at the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health in the United States, said in a study last week that Indonesia should rapidly strengthen outbreak surveillance and control, and that its lack of confirmed cases ""may suggest the potential for undetected cases"". The study also cited Thailand as a country that could have undetected cases, based on the researchers' model. Public health experts have concluded that the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside of China ""cannot possibly remain at current levels"", he said. ""It will eventually rise, and itÅEÄÅEs a matter of time before you see a lot of people around the world getting the disease.""e gave the example of the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, which saw ""10 per cent to 20 per cent"" of the global population contracting the illness and more than 400,000 people in Singapore contracting H1N1 in less than a year. ""WeÅEÄÅEre not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. ItÅEÄÅEs a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,""said. ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world. ""At this stage, as we have emphasised, if you look at the number of cases we have, if you look at the number of cases around the world outside of China, at this stage, there is no widespread community transmission of the virus in Singapore. ""There is no widespread community transmission of the virus in any country outside of China."" Mr Wong's remarks came as Singapore on Friday confirmed nine new cases of the disease, taking the total number of people who have tested positive for the coronavirus to 67. MOH said hundreds of general practitioner clinics will be reactivated as Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) as part of efforts to better detect and manage COVID-19 infections. This is a ""proactive step"" to reduce the risk of further community spread, said MOH. Singapore is ""doing everything"" to reduce the risk of further spread of COVID-19, Mr Wong said. ""But this is a fast-changing situation. We are getting new information every day and we are learning more about the virus every day,"" he said. ""We will also reassess and update our strategies to deal with this evolving situation.""

14 Feb 2020 03:36AM,Spike in China's COVID-19 cases doesn't show big shift in epidemic: WHO,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners GENEVA: The spike in COVID-19 cases reported from China reflects reclassifying a backlog of suspect cases using patients' chest images and not necessarily the ""tip of an iceberg"" of a wider epidemic, a top World Health Organization official said on Thursday (Feb 13). Michael Ryan, head of WHO's health emergencies programme, said that more than 13,300 cases reported in Hubei province overnight came after a change to include results from quicker computerised tomography (CT) scans that reveal lung infections, rather than relying on laboratory tests.   ""Crucially we understand that most of these cases relate to a period going back over days and weeks and are retrospectively reported as cases, sometimes back to the beginning of the outbreak itself,"" he told a news conference at WHO headquarters. ""We've seen this spike in the number of cases reported in China, but this does not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the outbreak,"" he said. In addition China has reported a total of 46,550 lab-confirmed cases since the outbreak began in December, WHO figures show. No significant shifts in mortality or severity patterns had been detected, Ryan said. Conducting household studies and developing serology tests that determine the level of antibodies in a community to a virus would deepen understanding of the epidemic's extent, he said. ""But this idea that this iceberg is absolutely massive and in some way we're only detecting 1 or 2 or 5 per cent, this is all based on modelling. This is based on certain assumptions,"" he said. ""And those assumptions and those speculations are as valid as speculations in the other direction."" Cases are not rising dramatically outside China apart from among passengers on a cruise liner now quarantined off the Japanese port of Yokohama, Ryan said. ""Outside cases on the Diamond Princess cruise ship we are not seeing dramatic increases in transmission outside China."" A further 44 cases were reported on the vessel on Thursday, raising the total to 219 though authorities said some elderly people would finally to be allowed to disembark on Friday. Ryan said that members of a WHO-led mission were expected to start arriving in China over the coming weekend, joining an advance team led by Dr. Bruce Aylward already in Beijing to help investigate the outbreak. ""In terms of the international mission, the advance team and their Chinese counterparts have now finalised the scope of work and design of the mission,"" he said, declining to give details.

16 Feb 2020 11:16AM,COVID-19 cases on Diamond Princess ship rise to 355,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TOKYO: The number of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 on a quarantined ship off Japan's coast has risen to 355, the country's health minister said Sunday (Feb 16). ""So far, we have conducted tests for 1,219 individuals. Of those, 355 people tested positive. Of those, 73 individuals are not showing symptoms,"" Katsunobu Kato told a roundtable discussion on public broadcaster NHK - a rise of 70 from the last government toll. The new figures came as the United States was preparing to evacuate some of its citizens from the Diamond Princess, which has been in quarantine since Feb 5 in the port of Yokohama, near Tokyo. Japan's efforts to control the viral infections on the vessel have prompted international concern. The cruise ship arrived off the Japanese coast in early February with more than 3,700 passengers and crew members from more than 50 countries and regions. It was placed under quarantine after authorities found that a passenger who got off the boat in Hong Kong during its voyage tested positive for the virus. Officials kept finding new infections among the passengers and crew members and transporting them to Japanese hospitals, while others have been told to stay inside their individual cabins during the 14-day quarantine period, which should end on Wednesday. Japan has not been able to test all those on board due to limited supplies of testing kits, facilities and manpower that are also needed by authorities tracking the spread of the virus among the general population. The US, Canada and Hong Kong said those repatriated will go through another two-week quarantine period at home. The US was preparing Sunday to evacuate some of its citizens but said those repatriated will go through another two-week quarantine period at home. An on-board announcement late Sunday said Americans choosing to leave should get ready, according to tweets from passengers. ""Disembarkation will begin at approximately 9pm (1200 GMT),"" the announcement said, asking the group to place their luggage outside their cabin doors. Japan's Self-Defence Forces will use about 20 buses to transport the evacuees to Tokyo's Haneda Airport, according to TV Asahi. LIMITED SUPPLIES ""Based on the high number of COVID-19 cases identified on board the Diamond Princess, the Department of Health and Human Services made an assessment that passengers and crew members on board are at high risk of exposure,"" the US embassy said in a letter to its citizens on the boat. Hong Kong has also said it will offer its 330 city residents on board the chance to take a charter flight back. Canada announced a similar decision to repatriate its nationals, while Australia and Taiwan are considering such a move, according to local media reports. Japan has not been able to test all those on board due to limited supplies of testing kits, facilities and manpower, which are also needed by authorities tracking the spread of the virus on land. But the health ministry said Saturday that passengers older than 70 are being examined and those testing negative and in good health will be allowed to leave the ship from Wednesday. Tests on younger passengers were expected to start Sunday and healthy people will be allowed to get off after Wednesday, it said. Meanwhile, Japan has seen 53 infections across the nation, including a dozen new cases reported on Saturday and 13 cases among more than 760 Japanese nationals and their relatives repatriated from Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the outbreak. Kato said Japan will boost efforts to encourage people with possible infections to quickly seek medical care. ""If you look at the figures, we are seeing changing situations compared with before,"" Kato said on the NHK show. ""What we have to think about now is preventing cases from becoming severe and preventing deaths.""

The cruise ship arrived off the Japanese coast in early February with more than 3,700 passengers and crew members from more than 50 countries and regions. It was placed under quarantine after authorities found that a passenger who got off the boat in Hong Kong during its voyage tested positive for the virus. Officials kept finding new infections among the passengers and crew members and transporting them to Japanese hospitals, while others have been told to stay inside their individual cabins during the 14-day quarantine period, which should end on Wednesday. Japan has not been able to test all those on board due to limited supplies of testing kits, facilities and manpower that are also needed by authorities tracking the spread of the virus among the general population. The US, Canada and Hong Kong said those repatriated will go through another two-week quarantine period at home. The US was preparing Sunday to evacuate some of its citizens but said those repatriated will go through another two-week quarantine period at home. An on-board announcement late Sunday said Americans choosing to leave should get ready, according to tweets from passengers. ""Disembarkation will begin at approximately 9pm (1200 GMT),"" the announcement said, asking the group to place their luggage outside their cabin doors. Japan's Self-Defence Forces will use about 20 buses to transport the evacuees to Tokyo's Haneda Airport, according to TV Asahi. LIMITED SUPPLIES ""Based on the high number of COVID-19 cases identified on board the Diamond Princess, the Department of Health and Human Services made an assessment that passengers and crew members on board are at high risk of exposure,"" the US embassy said in a letter to its citizens on the boat. Hong Kong has also said it will offer its 330 city residents on board the chance to take a charter flight back. Canada announced a similar decision to repatriate its nationals, while Australia and Taiwan are considering such a move, according to local media reports. Japan has not been able to test all those on board due to limited supplies of testing kits, facilities and manpower, which are also needed by authorities tracking the spread of the virus on land. But the health ministry said Saturday that passengers older than 70 are being examined and those testing negative and in good health will be allowed to leave the ship from Wednesday. Tests on younger passengers were expected to start Sunday and healthy people will be allowed to get off after Wednesday, it said. Meanwhile, Japan has seen 53 infections across the nation, including a dozen new cases reported on Saturday and 13 cases among more than 760 Japanese nationals and their relatives repatriated from Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the outbreak. Kato said Japan will boost efforts to encourage people with possible infections to quickly seek medical care. ""If you look at the figures, we are seeing changing situations compared with before,"" Kato said on the NHK show. ""What we have to think about now is preventing cases from becoming severe and preventing deaths.""

14 Feb 2020 06:12AM,Commentary: Fighting fear is key part in battling COVID-19,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners A perceived lack of transparency and accountability has seen governments around the world deal with trust issues as they tackle the outbreak, says Eugene K B Tan. SINGAPORE: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak will eventually come to an end ˚Ä˚ hopefully sooner rather than later. But the impact of the outbreak, be it to governments, healthcare systems, the economy, people˚Ä˚s lives, may linger for some time to come. However, as countries endeavour to deal with the public health threat, they will also have to inspire and provide confidence that they (and the people) are equal to the task. Unfortunately, fear of the virus has spread faster than the virus itself. SELF-CENTRED ATTITUDES IN SINGAPORE In Singapore, this has resulted in people engaging in self-centred or irrational behaviour, which often make matters worse. The irresponsible use of social media has given virility to fear and panic. Notwithstanding the valiant efforts by frontline healthcare, security, and other professionals, a foreboding sense of dread or even apocalyptic premonition appears to have developed over the outbreak. For example, last weekend we saw people heading in droves to supermarkets to panic buy and hoard basic necessities and essentials. Face masks, bread, rice, formula milk, instant noodles, and even toilet paper, were some of the more coveted items. Besides the panic-buying, some Singaporeans also felt entitled to frown upon nurses in their uniforms using public transport. A social media post by Education Minister Ong Ye Kung on Feb 10 pointed out that people were also shunning Victoria Junior College students in uniforms because one of its teachers was recently reported infected with the coronavirus.   Such social distancing measures are not only socially irresponsible but will fuel exclusionary and dehumanising responses against certain groups. Previously, it was xenophobic reactions to mainland Chinese in our midst; now, it˚Ä˚s nurses using public transport and refusing to serve students. Might others in the frontline combating the outbreak and those who recover from the virus be next? PUBLIC CONFIDENCE LOST ELSEWHERE Elsewhere in the world, there have been examples of what can happen when there is a lack of general trust in efforts to address the outbreak. In China, public trust in the management of the threat is critically low primarily due to an initial cover-up by the provincial authorities. Not only was precious time lost in preventing the spread but it accelerated many more infections within and without China. There remain concerns China has been vastly undercounting cases of the virus. Dr Li Wenliang, the whistleblower doctor in Wuhan, had in December last year first raised a red-flag on a mysterious virus infecting people in the city but was quickly silenced. He had said in a subsequent interview: If the officials had disclosed information about the epidemic earlier ... I think it would have been a lot better. There should be more openness and transparency. Similarly, distrust in the Hong Kong government˚Ä˚s strategy prompted protests and strikes by healthcare workers to demand full border closure with the mainland to stem the infections. In South Korea, the not-in-my-backyard attitudes have emerged as residents in two towns protested when the government planned to quarantine Korean evacuees from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, in their towns. This was primarily because of poor initial communication by the government in explaining the rationale of the move and to assure residents that their safety is of priority.   Such protests also emerged in Natuna in Indonesia where the country has quarantined about 280 citizens and flight crew evacuated from Wuhan. It did not help matters that the Indonesian Health Minister˚Ä˚s claims that the country has taken all the precautions needed to maintain zero cases was met with wide public ridicule, cynicism and disbelief. The government˚Ä˚s nonchalance has raised severe doubts whether it is ready to tackle the virus. THE CURIOUS CASE OF SINGAPORE As such, the reaction of Singaporeans in these aspects is curious. The Government here has done relatively well in keeping communications open and fluid. Press conferences helmed by the multi-agency task force chairs, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, have provided important information and timely updates. Pre-emptive measures and swift and decisive action were and are being taken to manage the public health threat. There has also been transparency. Collectively, they provide stability and normalcy amid a rapidly evolving situation. The number of cases in Singapore appear relatively high given the aggressive and methodical approach to detecting cases. Trust that the healthcare system is well prepared, coupled with free medical treatment for those infected with the virus and financially assisting those in isolation have incentivised those unwell to come forward. The containment of clusters of local transmission has helped prevent the virus from spreading. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted in his remarks to the nation last Saturday that the current outbreak may morph into widespread infection. But he also used his speech, in Malay, English and Mandarin, to calm the palpable public fear and assure Singaporeans that Singapore is prepared for the outbreak. He also contextualised this outbreak against other outbreaks in the past.   Government leaders have also come out firmly to caution against unsavoury behaviour. When the panic-buying began last Friday afternoon, several leaders had come out that evening to urge calm, explain and provide assurance that national stockpiles of essential items like rice are plenty. Supermarkets also quickly followed up and replenished stocks to assure Singaporeans that there is enough for everyone without hoarding. And when assurances werenÅEÄÅEt enough, NTUC supermarkets imposed purchase controls on some key items to prevent over-buying. Many of SingaporeÅEÄÅEs leaders, like Ministers Chan Chun Sing, Desmond Lee, Masagoes Zulkifli, Ong Ye Kung and K Shanmugam, have also called out inappropriate behaviour of shunning healthcare workers and students or engaging in xenophobia. Where needed and relevant, the Government has also used the legal tools at its disposal to thwart profiteering, disinformation and divisive comments. The fear and anxiety among ""poreans has probably little to do with a lack of trust and confidence in SingaporeÅEÄÅEs ability to fight. It is perhaps more the belief that individual self-help, on top of governmentÅEÄÅEs efforts, is preferred. Perhaps memories of the SARS episode of 2003 may have returned to instil fear. Or perhaps the fact that the virus cannot seem to be localised, contained, and is spreading means that fear is being continually stoked. But one canÅEÄÅEt levy too much blame on Singaporeans for this fear. After all, not much is still known of the virus and it was only around the Chinese New Year period that its severity dawned on us. To keep things in perspective, it is worth noting that there have been 15 million cases and 8,200 deaths worldwide",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/fear-and-panic-singapore-wuhan-virus-12425832
14 Feb 2020 02:30PM,COVID-19 to have 'significant' impact on economy: PM Lee Hsien Loong,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The ongoing COVID-19 situation will have a significant impact on Singapore's economy for the next couple of quarters, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Friday (Feb 14). The current outbreak is ""very intense"", he said. He noted the economies of the region are much more interlinked now than when Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) hit 17 years ago, noting the much bigger role played by China in the region now.    ""I can't say whether we will have a recession or not,"" said Mr Lee. ""It's possible, but definitely our economy will take a hit."" The Prime Minister noted that in a message to the country last week, he had said Singapore may eventually have to change its approach to tackling the virus should the number of confirmed cases continue to grow.   ""I don't think we've reached that point yet,"" he said. ""But it is an evolving situation. Every day brings new developments."" While numbers are high, recent cases have mostly been traceable, he noted. He added life here has to continue, even as the country has to make ""sensible judgements"" on the best course of action in tackling the virus. On whether Singapore must accept temperature screenings and other measures as the new normal, Mr Lee said how long such measures are required depends on how the outbreak develops in Singapore, the region and the rest of the world.   While Singapore was declared SARS-free in less than four months, the COVID-19 ""may not be so fast"", he said. ""It will eventually pass, and we will be back to normal, but I cannot say for sure how long it will take."" On the joint working committee between Malaysia and Singapore, Mr Lee said while the two are separate countries, they are ""one area"" from a public health perspective, noting the high traffic travelling back and forth between the two countries each day.   As such, Malaysia and Singapore had to work through the problem together, he said. Vietnam, as the current ASEAN chair, will also coordinate the group's response to the virus, he noted.   He noted a similar regional approach was taken during the SARS crisis. ""For us in Singapore, if the region has a problem it's going to be very, very difficult for Singapore to isolate ourselves and to keep the problem outside of our boundaries."" Mr Lee was speaking to the media on the sidelines of a visit to Changi Airport Terminal 3 on Friday.   Changi Airport is on the frontlines of the current coronavirus situation, said Mr Lee, noting the air travel industry has been badly hit, with fewer flights now. Accompanied by Senior Minister of State for Transport and Health Lam Pin Min, he met with various members of the airport's staff, including baggage handlers, check-in staff and immigration officers.

17 Feb 2020 08:11AM,Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. ˚Ä˚Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,˚Ä˚ the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore˚Ä˚s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. ˚Ä˚As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,˚Ä˚ Mr Lim said. ˚Ä˚MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.˚Ä˚ The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI˚Ä˚s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government˚Ä˚s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018˚Ä˚s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country˚Ä˚s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018˚Ä˚s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a ˚Ä˚modest growth˚Ä˚ in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board˚Ä˚s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON ˚Ä˚STRONG˚Ä˚ BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a ˚Ä˚strong˚Ä˚ relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million ˚Ä˚ way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003˚Ä˚s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. ÅEÄÅEA strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,ÅEÄÅE he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a ÅEÄÅEsizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset packageÅEÄÅE. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: ÅEÄÅEPolicymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response ",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764
15 Feb 2020 06:13PM,France announces first COVID-19 death outside Asia,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners PARIS: An 80-year-old Chinese tourist in France has died from COVID-19, said French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn on Saturday (Feb 15). This is the first novel coronavirus death outside of Asia. So far the only reported fatalities outside of the Chinese mainland has been in the Philippines, Japan and Hong Kong. Buzyn said she was informed on Friday that the man, who was treated at the Bichat hospital in northern Paris since Jan 25, had died of a lung infection due to the coronavirus. His condition ""had deteriorated rapidly"" after several critical days, she added. France has recorded 11 cases of the virus, out of a global total of 63,851. Six people with the virus remain in hospital in France, Buzyn said, adding that none was seriously ill. One of them was the dead Chinese tourist's 50-year-old daughter and the rest were British nationals who were infected by a compatriot at a French ski resort. The illness has killed more than 1,500 people and infected at least 66,000 in China while spreading to more than two dozen other countries, sparking an unprecedented containment effort. The scale of the epidemic ballooned this week after officials in the Chinese province of Hubei - the epicentre of the outbreak - changed their criteria for counting cases, adding thousands of new patients to the tally. Around 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan are now living under quarantine, virtually sealed off from the rest of the country in an effort to contain the virus. 'PREPARING FOR PANDEMIC' Away from China, almost 600 cases have been confirmed - roughly 35 of which have been reported in the European Union. The most concentrated number of cases outside China is on a cruise ship quarantined off the Japanese coast, which is holding at least 285 people with the virus among its 3,700 crew and passengers. The US embassy has said it will fly roughly 400 Americans on board the ship back their home country and Buzyn said France was ""always ready to repatriate its nationals"", though she made no firm commitment. There are believed to be four French nationals on the Diamond Princess, where all those on board are mostly confined to their cabins and required to wear masks and keep away from others during brief outings on deck. ""We are following the international situation very closely,"" Buzyn said. ""We need to prepare our health system to deal with a possible pandemic and therefore the circulation of the virus on national territory."" She said she would take stock of the situation on Tuesday in a meeting with health experts and officials.

17 Feb 2020 05:34PM,"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  Singapore reported two new COVID-19 cases on Monday, bringing its total to 77 confirmed cases. In all, 24 patients have fully recovered and been discharged from hospital, while 53 remain in hospital. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. ""The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added. The Government said it will continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order ""need to be separated from other people within the home"", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice ""common sense"" good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take ""some precautions"". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Officers will do surprise checks, and use technology, such as video calls to monitor people served the notice, Mr Wong said. As in the case of quarantine orders, eligible employers of those under the SHN can apply to MOM for a S$100 daily allowance. Affected self-employed citizens and PRs under the notice can apply for the S$100 daily allowance as well. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

This brings the total number of recovered cases to 13, out of 22 confirmed cases in the country. Posting on his Facebook page, Health Director-General Noor Hisham Abdullah said a man and his wife have been discharged from Permai Hospital in Johor Bahru.  The man was admitted on Jan 27 and his condition worsened three days later due to severe oxygen deficiency. He was treated with antiviral drugs and his condition improved. He was tested negative twice for COVID-19 and discharged on Tuesday. His wife was also diagnosed with the coronavirus. She was tested negative for the virus on Feb 5 but had wished to stay on in hospital until her husband had recovered. Earlier in the day, Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad said in a press conference that a 45-year-old man and his nine-year-old son were discharged on Tuesday. They had been evacuated from Wuhan but were diagnosed with the coronavirus after they arrived in Malaysia. The minister also said that all 107 Malaysians and their non-Malaysian family members who were evacuated from Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus outbreak epicentre on Feb 4, have tested negative in repeated tests. They were evacuated from Wuhan on a special AirAsia flight, which carried 500,000 pairs of rubber gloves as a contribution to the Chinese government. All passengers underwent health screening at the Air Disaster Unit at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, before they were ferried to the Higher Education Leadership Academy at Bandar Enstek, Nilai, Negeri Sembilan, where they were quarantined for 14 days. While all returnees were allowed to return home, Dr Dzulkefly said one of them is currently seeking treatment at a hospital for another health issue.   With no new cases reported on Tuesday, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases stands at 22. Separately, Dr Dzulkefly said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of World Health Organization (WHO), has suggested to Malaysia in a teleconference on Tuesday to test severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) patients for COVID-19.

Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

13 Feb 2020 07:29PM,"Eight new COVID-19 cases in Singapore, all linked to previous patients","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Eight new cases of COVID-19 were announced by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Thursday (Feb 13), all linked to previous cases. ""Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases,"" MOH said in a press release. This brings the total number of cases in Singapore to 58. Five of the new cases are linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster, while two are linked to the cluster at Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site. One of the new cases is a family member of a DBS employee, who tested positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday. Contact tracing is under way for the other seven locally transmitted cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to mainland China.   FIVE NEW CASES LINKED TO CHURCH Cases 51, 53, 54, 57 and 58 are all linked to the cluster associated with the Grace Assembly of God churches, where there have been two previously confirmed cases (48 and 49). The five new cases have no recent travel history to China. CASE 51 Case 51 is a 48-year-old Singaporean man who developed symptoms on Feb 4 and sought treatment at a GP clinic on Feb 5 and Feb 10. He went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 11 and was tested positive for the coronavirus a day later. Prior to hospital admission, he went to work at the Tanglin and Bukit Batok branches of the church. He stays at Bishan St 13. CASE 53 Case 53 is a 54-year-old Singaporean man who reported symptoms on Feb 10 and went to NCID two days later. He was tested positive for the coronavirus on the same day. Prior to being admitted to hospital, he mostly stayed at home at Hillview Avenue, MOH said. He works at the National University of Singapore but had not interacted with students and colleagues after the onset of symptoms. CASES 54, 57 and 58 A 54-year-old Singaporean woman (Case 54), a 26-year-old Singaporean man (Case 57) and a 55-year-old Singaporean man (Case 58) are all linked to the cluster at the churches. They were confirmed to have the coronavirus on Thursday morning and are warded in separate isolation rooms at NCID. No more information was given about their movements prior to hospital admission. TWO NEW CASES LINKED TO CONSTRUCTION SITE Two of the new patients ˚Ä˚ cases 52 and 56 ˚Ä˚ are linked to the cluster at Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site, where there have been two previously confirmed cases. Both new cases have no recent travel history to China. CASE 52 Case 52 is a 37-year-old Bangladesh national who is a Singapore work pass holder. He reported the onset of symptoms on Feb 7 and was identified as a close contact to cases 42 and 47, who worked at the construction site. On Feb 11, he was taken by ambulance to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where he tested positive for the coronavirus a day later. Prior to hospital admission, he had gone to work at the construction site. He reported he had mostly stayed at his rental apartment in Campbell Lane since the onset of symptoms. CASE 56 Case 56 is a 30-year-old Bangladesh national who was confirmed to have the COVID-19 infection on Thursday morning. He is currently warded at NCID. No other information about his movements prior to hospital admission has been announced. DBS EMPLOYEE AND FAMILY MEMBER CASE 55 One of the new cases, case 55, is a 30-year-old Singaporean with no recent travel history to China. He is a family member of case 50, a DBS employee who tested positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday. On Thursday, case 55 was tested positive for the infection and is currently warded at NCID. MOH provided more information on Thursday about the DBS employee. Case 50 is a 62-year-old Singaporean man with no recent travel history to China. He had reported symptoms on Feb 7 and went to two GP clinics on Feb 7, Feb 10 and Feb 11. He was admitted to NCID on Feb 11 and tested positive for the infection on Feb 12. Prior to hospital admission, he had gone to work at DBS Asia Central at Marina Bay Financial Centre in 12 Marina Boulevard. He had also stayed at his home in Mei Hwan Drive other than to seek medical treatment. On Thursday, MOH said case 44 ÅEÄÅE a Certis Cisco officer who served quarantine orders on two ""ple from Wuhan - was ""a contact of cases 13 and 26"". Case 13 was a 73-year-old woman from Wuhan who had arrived in on Jan 21, the same day as her daughter, who was case 26. It is unclear if the Certis Cisco officer served quarantine orders on cases 13 and 26. Besides the clusters linked to Grace Assembly of God and the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site, MOH has identified three other clusters and possible clusters. Three of the previous cases - cases 30, 36 and 39 - are linked to a private business meeting at Grand Hyatt Singapore from Jan 20 to Jan 22. The meeting is also linked to several other cases in Malaysia, South Korean and Britian. A possible cluster of five cases - cases 8, 9, 31, 33 and 38 - is linked to The Life Church and Missions Singapore at 146B Paya Lebar Road. Nine of the confirmed cases - case 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 34 and 40 - are linked to the cluster associated with a shop named Yong Thai Hang in 24 Cavan Road.       As of Thursday, 15 people have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Seven are in critical condition in the intensive care unit ÅEÄÅE down from eight cases on Wednesday. Of the 43 confirmed cases still in hospital, most are stable or improving, MOH said. Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing, the ministry added. As o",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/covid19-coronavirus-feb-13-singapore-update-12429952
17 Feb 2020 06:15AM,"The Big Read: Panic buying grabbed the headlines, but a quiet resilience is seeing Singaporeans through COVID-19 outbreak","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Now that a sense of normalcy has returned, questions remained. What caused all that panic buying, which had left some quarters fuming and embarrassed, and others to question whatever happened to decades of efforts aimed at building a resilient society? SINGAPORE: Tired and hungry after a long day at work, Mr Derrick Tay was looking forward to returning home for a warm shower, having something to eat and watching Netflix in bed. But something caught his attention while he was mindlessly thumbing through his phone in the train around 9pm on Friday a week ago: Images of shoppers making a mad dash for groceries at supermarkets across the island. While Singaporeans have earned a reputation for being kiasu (Hokkien for the fear of missing out), it was a scene that no one has witnessed here before - not even during the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) crisis in 2003 or the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. Just hours earlier, the Ministry of Health (MOH) had raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) risk assessment level from Yellow to Orange. The DORSCON level was raised after several COVID-19 cases were detected in the Republic without any links to previous cases or travel histories to China. ˚Ä˚I was shocked by what I saw on my phone. When I got home, I told my parents about it,˚Ä˚ Mr Tay, 31, said. His mother had planned to do her weekly grocery run on Saturday but he told her to do it that night as he ˚Ä˚wasn˚Ä˚t sure if there would be anything left for her to buy in the morning at the rate people were wiping out the shelves˚Ä˚.   The mother and son then headed to their neighbourhood˚Ä˚s mini-mart in Choa Chu Kang. ˚Ä˚It was crazy that day. I˚Ä˚ve never seen so many people inside before, and at such a late hour. There was a queue that wound around the inside of the store,˚Ä˚ said Mr Tay, who ended up having to wait for more than 30 minutes to pay for his purchases. His basket of groceries held a bag of rice, four packs of assorted instant noodle flavours, a bottle of oil and several cans of tuna and sardine. His 72-year-old mother, who helped carry two bags˚Ä˚ worth of toilet paper, told him that she could not remember Singaporeans panicking like this. Despite reassurances from Government leaders including Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing who took to Facebook to call for calm, Mr Tay and many Singaporeans were not entirely assured as the panic buying continued through the night. In fact, Mr Tay was still in the queue when he read Mr Chan˚Ä˚s Facebook post but he went on to complete his purchases. He said his actions were partly shaped by the mask situation. The Government had made clear that it has a stockpile of masks but this did not prevent long queues or stocks running out at shops and pharmacies. What happened was that the Government had released five million masks to retailers over nine days last month but these were sold out within hours. As a result, the Government decided to distribute the masks from its stockpile directly to families, capped at four masks per household. At the same time, it has reiterated that there is no need for people to wear a mask if they are well and it is more important to practise good personal hygiene such as washing hands. Singapore, like many countries, has been grappling with a mask shortage since the health crisis started, sparked by a sudden surge in demand.   While many like Mr Tay understood the constraints and logistical challenges involved, as far as they are concerned, the takeaway was that they had great difficulty getting masks from retailers and ultimately, had to rely on a limited number given out by the Government. And even if supplies are in no danger of running out, Mr Tay argued that it would not hurt to be prepared. ˚Ä˚Anyway, if there˚Ä˚s no emergency, we˚Ä˚ll just take it as having done a few days˚Ä˚ worth of shopping beforehand,˚Ä˚ he said. While Mr Tay and his mother had joined the hordes of shoppers at the supermarkets, their purchase was relatively measured compared to the others: Pictures of shoppers with overflowing trolleys went viral, along with photographs and videos of empty vegetable and fruit baskets, and chillers devoid of meat. Still, some like Dr Paul Tambyah felt it was understandable why these shoppers behaved the way they did. Noting that Singapore, along with the rest of the world, would have to deal with the outbreak for the next several months, Dr Tambyah ˚Ä˚ who is president of the Asia-Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection ˚Ä˚ noted that in such a situation, it was practical to keep some essential supplies on standby in case one has to be put on quarantine, for instance. ˚Ä˚As far as I know, when a quarantine officer comes to put a person on quarantine, they do not let you go shopping at the supermarket first,˚Ä˚ he said. To allay public anxiety, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made a speech a day after the panic buying, assuring Singaporeans that there was no need to panic as the city was not being locked down, and there was ample supply of food for everyone. Now that a sense of normalcy has returned, questions remain to be answered: What caused all that panic buying over that fateful weekend, which had left some quarters fuming - and embarrassed - over the behaviour of ˚Ä˚ugly Singaporeans˚Ä˚, and others to question whatever happened to decades of efforts aimed at building a resilient society? And what does it say about Singaporeans, many of whom have stoically and quietly got on with their lives, despite the uncertainty and disruptions to daily life? THE SITUATION ELSEWHERE So far, apart from Singapore, there have been no reports of panic buying in places outside of China. Residents in Thailand for example said the situation was calm and there has been no run on daily essentials. Some experts believe that events in Hong Kong, which was gripped by scenes of panic buying recently, had influenced Singaporeans˚Ä˚ behaviour. Mr Wong Bai Chun, a Hong Kong citizen, said that two weeks ago, there was a brief but acute shortage of toilet paper and other paper goods in the territory, which was sparked by an Internet rumour that the Chinese spring holiday was being extended and there would be insufficient supplies of such products. Mr Wong said the fear over paper shortage had spread to other goods in Hong Kong. ˚Ä˚Now you can˚Ä˚t find rice anywhere,˚Ä˚ said the 26-year-old who works in the finance industry. Unlike Macau or mainland China, there are no regulations in Hong Kong to curb such behaviours, he added. He said the panic buying and hoarding of daily essentials in Hong Kong stemmed from the shortage of disposable masks. ˚Ä˚At the moment, people are sourcing their masks from all over the world and there˚Ä˚s simply not enough,˚Ä˚ he said. ˚Ä˚Hong Kong doesn˚Ä˚t have the capacity to manufacture sufficient amounts of them.˚Ä˚   While the panic buying in Hong Kong mirrors what happened in Singapore, the similarity ends there. For one, there is no risk of Singapore running short of essential food and household items like toilet paper from short-term disruptions, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, said Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli. The country has managed to be resilient due to astute planning by the nationÅEÄÅEs food agencies and its well-connected transport network, he said on Feb 10 during the launch of the 2020 Singapore Food Story. The food security strategy aims to meet 30 per cent of the countryÅEÄÅEs nutritional needs by 2030 using less than 1 per cent of its land area. On the evening of the panic buying in Singapore, Mr Seah Kian Peng, who is the chief executive of supermarket cooperative NTUC Fairprice, also assured the public that there were sufficient supplies of daily essentials in the wa""se. However, as experts pointed out, rationality and logic get cast aside when panic sets in. ˚Ä˚Research suggests that when people are in panic, the thinking part of our brain gets hijacked by the emotional system and we start to act illogically,˚Ä˚ said a spokesperson for the Singapore Psychological Society (SPS) council. ˚Ä˚Our ability to decide on our own is minimised.˚Ä˚ OTHER TRIGGERS Among the possible factors behind the panic buying was negativity bias where people˚Ä˚s brains tend to focus more on negative information than positive ones, said the SPS spokesperson. ˚Ä˚Our brains are hardwired to register negative stimuli more readily and also to dwell and worry on them for a longer period of time,˚Ä˚ the spokesperson said. Furthermore, whenever there is a life-threatening epidemic or emergency, the notions of safety, protection, and self-preservation usually come into play. The spokesperson also noted people also tend to follow others in the hope that the latter could get them out of a dangerous situation. In Singapore˚Ä˚s case, this could be a possible reason why people started to hoard or buy things impulsively if everyone else around them was doing the same, or if they were told to do so on social media platforms. This phenomenon of group-think results in irrational and dysfunctional thinking and outcomes. ˚Ä˚In this case, our brains focus more on the fear generated rather than on the reassurance given,˚Ä˚ said the spokesperson. Mr Lars Voedisch, the managing director of public relations firm PRecious Communications, said that such behaviour is triggered by one or two initial incidents which then get amplified by social media. ˚Ä˚(This leads) to a snowball effect of more and more people thinking of it, then hearing from the first people acting on their fear, sharing about it and through that fuelling the whole panic,˚Ä˚ he said. The images of empty shelves circulating on social media played a big part, said Singapore Management University sociologist Paulin Straughan. ˚Ä˚This meant that people were no longer reacting to rumours that essentials might run out, but this new development itself,˚Ä˚ she said. ˚Ä˚Which is: The shelves are empty. Better start to go now.˚Ä˚   Professor Straughan, whose research interests include medical sociology that encompasses infectious diseases, said it did not help that the public was seeing these images circulated on social media late in the night. As a result, these became the abiding images for many Singaporeans overnight. ÅEÄÅEFor the next 12 hours, the shelves remain empty (in their minds),ÅEÄÅE she said. ÅEÄÅEAnd thatÅEÄÅEs 12 hours of festering, and it entrenches (the fear that there are no supplies).ÅEÄÅE Agreeing with Mr VoedischÅEÄÅEs observation about social media, Prof Straughan reiterated that while technology has helped to disseminate information a lot faster, it has similarly allowed misinformation to spread just as quickly as well. This was not something that Singaporeans had to worry about during the past virus outbreaks, she added. The SPS council spokesperson noted that when the COVID-19 virus was first made known, there was an overw""t of news and social media coverage. ÅEÄÅEWhen the DORSCON Orange was finally announced, it became a trigger tantamount to saying ÅEÄÅEthe coronavirus has arrivedÅEÄÅE, resulting in the accompanying hoarding behaviour as response,ÅEÄÅE the spokesperson said. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Professor May Oo Lwin, whose research interest at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI) includes strategic and health communications, said it is likely that the public was responding to certain levels of fear and stress that the deluge of messages had aroused. She explained that scientists have pointed to a phenomenon where communication leading to fear and stressful emotions can cause unintended consequences. Suc""s, she said, needed to be concurrently countered with provision of strategies for coping with perceived threats. ÅEÄÅEIn this particular case, all the media information is likely to have induced strong emotive elements which were managed by some population segments by embracing these forms of rational or irrational, but culturally symbolic, behaviours,ÅEÄÅE said Prof Lwin. In other words, some segments of the population ÅEÄÅEmay undertake actions based around daily priorities to respond to their perceptions of the threatÅEÄÅE, said the health communications expert. For example, in extreme cases of crisis like an earthquake, people could be seen taking their television sets while evacuating, she noted. That could explain why stacks of toilet paper were snapped up by Singaporeans during the panic buying. Prof Straughan had another theory: They were relatively cheap and easy to hoard. ÅEÄÅEWe all want to do something to make ourselves feel better,ÅEÄÅE she quipped. PUBLIC COMMS ""EEN BETTER"" Communications experts said the panic-buying in Singapore might have been avoided if the information disseminated by the authorities had been clearer. ÅEÄÅEThe problem with the message was that it was too bureaucratic at the start,ÅEÄÅE said Assistant Professor Liew Kai Khiun, who teaches at NTU's WKWSCI. ÅEÄÅEMuch of the GovernmentÅEÄÅEs message involved military terms (and) colour codes.""raughan agreed, noting that the definition of DORSCON Orange was not explained enough as well. DORSCON is a colour-coded framework that shows the current disease situation. Orange refers to a situation in which a virus is spreading in Singapore but not widely, and is being contained. Previously, the risk assessment level was at Yellow, signifying that the virus was severe and could infect from person to person, but was chiefly occurring outside Singapore. The highest level, Red, indicates that the virus is spreading widely and can result in major disruption such as closing schools. ˚Ä˚Some people didn˚Ä˚t know what it meant. All they saw was the visual,˚Ä˚ said Prof Straughan. ˚Ä˚There are four levels. Green, Yellow, Orange and Red. Red is bad, everybody knows that right? Green is good. Now Orange. It is closer to Red than it is to Green. So visually, it lights up all your flags.˚Ä˚ Asst Prof Liew pointed out while the message from the authorities was accurate, it did not cater to the layman. To that end, they could have used dialect or Singlish to reach out more effectively, he noted. During the SARS outbreak in 2003, local sitcom character Phua Chu Kang was used to educate Singaporeans on the importance of washing their hands. This, he said, was an effective way of reaching out to the public, and many people still remember it today. A leaked MOH press release a few hours before the official DORSCON Orange announcement, which left many befuddled, might have also fuelled the public panic. The press release was circulated on social media and through messaging platforms such as WhatsApp. Up till this incident, Prof Straughan felt that the Government had been doing well in being upfront with Singaporeans about the virus situation. But when the press release was prematurely leaked out, it created some confusion. She said it did not help that recipients of the leaked document were initially told by others that it was fake news, only to be informed by the authorities a few hours later that it was indeed true. Such contradictory information would have led some to question if the authorities were trying to hide something, she said. The authorities have yet to announce the source of the leak, but Trade and Industry Minister Chan said on Feb 9 that the various agencies involved in tackling the virus will remind their staff that they have a professional responsibility not to prematurely share information that has not been finalised. Despite these short-comings in public communications, some experts felt that Prime Minister LeeÅEÄÅEs nine-minute long speech on Feb 8 went some way in restoring a sense of normalcy.

ÅEÄÅEWhen the DORSCON Orange was finally announced, it became a trigger tantamount to saying ÅEÄÅEthe coronavirus has arrivedÅEÄÅE, resulting in the accompanying hoarding behaviour as response,ÅEÄÅE the spokesperson said. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Professor May Oo Lwin, whose research interest at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI) includes strategic and health communications, said it is likely that the public was responding to certain levels of fear and stress that the deluge of messages had aroused. She explained that scientists have pointed to a phenomenon where communication leading to fear and stressful emotions can cause unintended consequences. Suc""s, she said, needed to be concurrently countered with provision of strategies for coping with perceived threats. ÅEÄÅEIn this particular case, all the media information is likely to have induced strong emotive elements which were managed by some population segments by embracing these forms of rational or irrational, but culturally symbolic, behaviours,ÅEÄÅE said Prof Lwin. In other words, some segments of the population ÅEÄÅEmay undertake actions based around daily priorities to respond to their perceptions of the threatÅEÄÅE, said the health communications expert. For example, in extreme cases of crisis like an earthquake, people could be seen taking their television sets while evacuating, she noted. That could explain why stacks of toilet paper were snapped up by Singaporeans during the panic buying. Prof Straughan had another theory: They were relatively cheap and easy to hoard. ÅEÄÅEWe all want to do something to make ourselves feel better,ÅEÄÅE she quipped. PUBLIC COMMS ""EEN BETTER"" Communications experts said the panic-buying in Singapore might have been avoided if the information disseminated by the authorities had been clearer. ÅEÄÅEThe problem with the message was that it was too bureaucratic at the start,ÅEÄÅE said Assistant Professor Liew Kai Khiun, who teaches at NTU's WKWSCI. ÅEÄÅEMuch of the GovernmentÅEÄÅEs message involved military terms (and) colour codes.""raughan agreed, noting that the definition of DORSCON Orange was not explained enough as well. DORSCON is a colour-coded framework that shows the current disease situation. Orange refers to a situation in which a virus is spreading in Singapore but not widely, and is being contained. Previously, the risk assessment level was at Yellow, signifying that the virus was severe and could infect from person to person, but was chiefly occurring outside Singapore. The highest level, Red, indicates that the virus is spreading widely and can result in major disruption such as closing schools. ˚Ä˚Some people didn˚Ä˚t know what it meant. All they saw was the visual,˚Ä˚ said Prof Straughan. ˚Ä˚There are four levels. Green, Yellow, Orange and Red. Red is bad, everybody knows that right? Green is good. Now Orange. It is closer to Red than it is to Green. So visually, it lights up all your flags.˚Ä˚ Asst Prof Liew pointed out while the message from the authorities was accurate, it did not cater to the layman. To that end, they could have used dialect or Singlish to reach out more effectively, he noted. During the SARS outbreak in 2003, local sitcom character Phua Chu Kang was used to educate Singaporeans on the importance of washing their hands. This, he said, was an effective way of reaching out to the public, and many people still remember it today. A leaked MOH press release a few hours before the official DORSCON Orange announcement, which left many befuddled, might have also fuelled the public panic. The press release was circulated on social media and through messaging platforms such as WhatsApp. Up till this incident, Prof Straughan felt that the Government had been doing well in being upfront with Singaporeans about the virus situation. But when the press release was prematurely leaked out, it created some confusion. She said it did not help that recipients of the leaked document were initially told by others that it was fake news, only to be informed by the authorities a few hours later that it was indeed true. Such contradictory information would have led some to question if the authorities were trying to hide something, she said. The authorities have yet to announce the source of the leak, but Trade and Industry Minister Chan said on Feb 9 that the various agencies involved in tackling the virus will remind their staff that they have a professional responsibility not to prematurely share information that has not been finalised. Despite these short-comings in public communications, some experts felt that Prime Minister LeeÅEÄÅEs nine-minute long speech on Feb 8 went some way in restoring a sense of normalcy.

17 Feb 2020 06:14AM,"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. ˚Ä˚Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,˚Ä˚ said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. ˚Ä˚Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn˚Ä˚t kill that much.˚Ä˚ This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. ˚Ä˚This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ˚Ä˚burns out˚Ä˚ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,˚Ä˚ said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. ÅEÄÅEThere is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ÅEÄÅEsinisterÅEÄÅE, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.ÅEÄÅE According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. ÅEÄÅEI believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed ma""nd virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,ÅEÄÅE said Dr Leong. ÅEÄÅECOVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.ÅEÄÅE According to Dr Leong, there is a ÅEÄÅEnatural tendencyÅEÄÅE for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spre""if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. ""This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: ÅEÄÅEIt becomes another flu bug",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600

The new cases take the total number of confirmed cases on the Diamond Princess to 542 - the biggest cluster outside the epicentre in China. The patients will be sent to specialised hospitals, Japan's health ministry said in a statement. Sixty-five of those who tested positive were not yet showing symptoms. The government earlier on Tuesday said all passengers and crew aboard the ship were tested for the coronavirus. Britain became the latest country to offer its citizens a way off the boat, saying it was working to ""organise a flight"" back to the UK. Canada, Australia, Hong Kong and South Korea have already said they will evacuate their citizens from the ship, following the lead from the United States, which flew home around 300 Americans on Monday - including more than a dozen who had tested positive. Japan has faced criticism for its handling of the situation, with dozens of new infections detected almost daily since the ship arrived in early February. But it has defended its approach and health minister Katsunobu Kato insisted again Tuesday that passengers who test negative will be allowed to leave the ship from Wednesday. ""We have done tests for everyone (on the ship),"" he told reporters. ""Some results have already come out ... and for those whose test results are already clear, we are working to prepare disembarkation from the 19th,"" he said. Kato said the process would last two or three days. But those who had close contact with people who have tested positive will have their quarantine reset to the date of their last contact with an infected person. Crew are also expected to remain to observe another quarantine period after the last passengers leave the ship. So far, the United States, Canada, Australia, Hong Kong and now South Korea have said they will evacuate their citizens from the ship. TOKYO MARATHON South Korea will send a presidential aircraft on Tuesday to fly back four nationals and one Japanese spouse, an official told reporters. There are 14 South Koreans on board in total, but the other ten have declined to be evacuated from the ship because they live in Japan, the Yonhap news agency reported. Early Monday, more than 300 Americans were evacuated from the ship, among them over a dozen who have tested positive for the virus. The Americans, like citizens from other countries being evacuated from ship, will have to undergo another 14-day quarantine. Canada said Tuesday it had ""secured a chartered flight to repatriate Canadians on board the Diamond Princess"" but gave no details on when the process would take place. There were 256 Canadians on board the ship, with 32 so far testing positive for the virus. While foreign governments have couched their decision to remove citizens as an attempt to reduce the burden on Japanese authorities, many have interpreted the evacuations as criticism of Tokyo's handling of the situation. The US and Australia have told citizens that if they decline repatriation and an additional 14-day quarantine, they will not be allowed home for at least two weeks, suggesting they do not believe the ship-based quarantine has worked. Those on the ship who have so far tested positive for the coronavirus have been removed to local hospitals for treatment. Japan has also confirmed at least 65 cases domestically, including many involving people with no history of recent travel to China. Authorities have said the virus is being transmitted locally now, and have asked citizens to avoid crowds and non-essential gatherings. On Monday, the amateur portion of the Tokyo Marathon, which had been expected to attract some 38,000 runners, was cancelled. Only elite athletes will now be able to take part.

Of them, two are from the Grace Assembly of God church, and one of them works at DBS bank at the Marina Bay Financial Centre. All three of them are Singaporean and have no recent travel history to mainland China. The two patients linked to the church are two male employees aged 34 and 46 who visited both Grace Assembly of God churches at Tanglin and Bukit Batok, MOH said. The church said on its Facebook page that it will stop all church services and activities for two weeks. The DBS employee is 62 years old. This brings the number of confirmed cases of the virus in Singapore to 50.     As of Wednesday, six more people were discharged from hospital, bringing the total number of patients who have recovered to 15. The newly discharged patients are cases 4, 12, 25, 29, 34 and 40, all of whom are adults. They are a 36-year-old man and 37-year-old woman from Wuhan who stayed at Village Hotel Sentosa, the husband of a tour guide linked a cluster of infections, a 41-year-old Singaporean who was the first one reported not to have any known links to previous cases, and two Yong Thai Hang employees. Of the 35 confirmed cases still in hospital, eight are in the Intensive Care Unit and in critical condition. Assoc Prof Mak said that a six-month-old, who is among the confirmed cases, is doing well. On the sidelines of the media conference, he said that there has yet to be a pattern established among those who are in intensive care. Health Minister Gan Kim Yong cautioned that while there are patients who are stable and recovering from the viral infection, there could be patients who may succumb to it. ˚Ä˚We have to be prepared for the worst,˚Ä˚ he said. As of noon on Wednesday, 638 suspect cases had tested negative. Test results for 125 cases are pending, MOH said. It added that as of the same time, it has identified 1,090 close contacts of the confirmed cases, of whom 984 are in Singapore. Of them, 961 have been contacted and are being isolated or quarantined. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining 23 contacts in Singapore, it said. CASE 48 The 34-year-old man, an employee of Grace Assembly of God church, reported onset of symptoms on Feb 1 and sought treatment at four private clinics over more than a week. Before he was admitted at the NCID he visited shopping mall Plaza Singapura and Fusionopolis in One North. He lives in Bukit Batok. CASE 49 The 46-year-old man, an employee of Grace Assembly of God church, reported onset of symptoms on Feb 3, and sought treatment at a general practitioner five days later. On the same day, he went to the emergency department at the National University Hospital (NUH) and was discharged. He was admitted to NUH two days later. CASE 50 The 62-year-old man, an employee of DBS was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on Wednesday morning. On Wednesday, DBS said an employee had been infected with the coronavirus, prompting the bank to take precautionary measures and have employees at the affected Marina Bay Financial Centre office work from home. The bank is conducting con""act tracing with all employees and any others the infected person may have come into contact with. Assoc Prof Mak urged people not to ""doctor hop"", so that the doctors who visit can monitor them and their symptoms accurately.   HEALTHCARE WORKERS DESERVE SUPPORT Mr Gan also appealed to Singaporeans not to shun healthcare workers, who are on the frontline taking care of patients. He urged them to show these workers ÅEÄÅEwell-deservedÅEÄÅE support. ÅEÄÅEA kind word or warm greeting can go a long way,ÅEÄÅE he said.   Mr Gan also thanked general practitioners who are on the frontline, and play a critical role in detecting and managing patients. He said that his ministry will put aside 1 million masks for private doctors, including specialists. Some of them have given feedback that they are concerned about the supply of masks, he said. ""like to take this opportunity to assure them that they would get the supplies that they need because they are a part of our team,"" he said. Last week, authorities raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange, prompting additional precautionary measures. The coronavirus outbreak is expected to take a toll on the tourism sector, with the Singapore Tourism Board on Tuesday saying visitor arrivals are estimated to fall by 25 per cent to 30 per cent this year. The virus, officially named COVID-19 on Tuesday, has killed more than 1,100 people and infected nearly 45,000 since it emerged in China at the end of last year. It has since spread beyond China to 24 other countries, with the World Health Organization declaring a public health emergency last month.

18 Feb 2020 04:16PM,Shanghai hospital tries array of treatments for COVID-19,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SHANGHAI: In a sprawling medical compound an hour's drive from downtown Shanghai, doctors are employing a patchwork of coronavirus treatments in a race to save victims of an epidemic for which there is still no established cure. The Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center is the designated facility for coronavirus cases in China's biggest city, which was previously used to treat victims of the 2002-03 SARS epidemic (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and was hastily expanded to handle the current outbreak. But doctors said the scale of the COVID-19 health crisis, which has killed more than 1,800 people, mostly in China, and infected nearly 72,500 worldwide, has pushed the medical centre to its limits. ""Admitting so many severe cases all at once is a big test for us,"" Lu Hongzhou, the centre's co-director, told reporters through a face mask during a government-organised tour on Monday (Feb 17). The centre so far has admitted 320 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 135 of whom have recovered and been discharged, while one has died, Lu said. All told, Shanghai has reported 333 confirmed cases of the virus, with the sole death being an 88-year-old man. Doctors at the medical centre are still treating 184 people, including 14 in critical condition. They are using a mix of methods including anti-viral medications, corticosteroids, blood plasma from recovered patients, and a healthy dose of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). ""We have customised treatment plans for critically ill patients, as their conditions vary,"" Lu said. ""Some are 50 years old. Some are 80. Some have cardiovascular conditions. So, 'one patient, one plan,'"" he said.   Some Western experts have questioned using TCM, saying its efficacy remains unproven by science, making it a potentially dangerous placebo. But Lu said two severe cases who did not respond to anti-viral drugs alone were also administered TCM, after which their conditions improved. ""The combination of both Western and Chinese medicine has achieved a great effect in combating the virus,"" Lu said, adding that 90 per cent of all the hospital's patients were given Chinese medicines. Yet his colleague Shen Yinzhong, the hospital's director of medical services, cautioned that more study was needed. ""We still need to do more clinical trials to prove (TCM's) safety and efficacy,"" Shen said.   WAR FOOTING As drug-makers work towards a vaccine and treatment for the epidemic, Chinese health officials on Monday urged recovered patients to donate blood. Plasma from such patients contains antibodies that can help reduce the virus load in critically ill patients, the government said. It has the potential to infect patients with other illnesses carried in the blood, however, requiring rigorous screening of plasma. The Shanghai medical centre began using plasma in recent days. ""We are positive that this method can be very effective in our patients,"" Lu said. The collection of light-yellow, low-rise buildings has gone on something of a war footing, with all staff leave cancelled, and specialists drafted in from a range of other medical facilities. Those tending to virus patients wear full-body protective suits with a respirator. Reporters were not permitted to see patients undergoing treatment, with officials citing the health risks. To protect doctors and staff, dozens of wards have been set up featuring ""negative pressure"", a ventilation arrangement allowing air to flow into a room but not out, to prevent contaminants escaping. ""We have done a great amount of work to protect our medical staff. In the negative pressure wards, harmful droplets respired from the patients will be sucked away and filtered,"" Lu said.

16 Feb 2020 06:01AM,"Cruise liners steer clear of mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore over COVID-19 fears","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Instances of cruise ships being stuck at sea have prompted enhanced measures, including maintaining a clean environment and conducting health checks for those on board. SINGAPORE: Major cruise liners have changed their itineraries in Asia to avoid calling at major ports like Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore amid fears of COVID-19. Concurrently, they have imposed restrictions on passengers and stepped up health checks as well as cleaning protocols to assuage fears. When asked by CNA, British-American cruise line Cunard said that one of its ships, the Queen Mary 2, will skip a scheduled stop in Singapore this month. Passengers who were due to embark in Singapore will have the option of joining them from Freemantle, Australia and set sail on an Australian itinerary. Royal Caribbean and Celebrity Cruises have also reportedly cancelled sailings to Singapore in the coming weeks. As of Saturday (Feb 15), Singapore reported more than 70 confirmed cases for COVID-19. Earlier, the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level was raised to Orange from Yellow. Additionally, for Regent Seven Seas Cruises, its ship the Seven Seas Voyager has removed Hong Kong from its Feb 12, Mar 1 and Mar 13 voyages. Meanwhile, Princess Cruise Line has also modified the itinerary for at least two of its ships ˚Ä˚ the Sapphire Princess and Sun Princess. For the Sapphire Princess, its voyages departing on Apr 16, May 2 and May 18 will arrive in Tokyo instead of Shanghai. As for the Sun Princess, its scheduled calls to Hong Kong on Apr 28 and Jul 14, and Shanghai on May 1 and Jul 17, have been cancelled and replaced with calls to Seoul and Jeju in South Korea. Mainland China, where the outbreak is said to have originated, has reported more than 1,500 deaths and over 65,000 infections.   Concerns over COVID-19 have been amplified by how one of Princess Cruise Line˚Ä˚s ship, the Diamond Princess, has become the largest single cluster of cases outside China. The ship has been quarantined in the Japanese port of Yokohama and its 3,600 passengers and crew have been stuck at sea. More than 200 people who were on board have been tested positive for the virus and they have been transferred to a local health facility for treatment. Moreover, another cruise ship MS Westerdam carrying 1,455 passengers and 802 crew members was finally permitted to dock at the Cambodian port city of Sihanoukville after it spent the last two weeks at sea having been turned away by five counties over fears of the coronavirus.   These recent developments have prompted more measures by cruise liners to avoid an outbreak on board as this can lead to bad publicity and hurt them financially, said infectious diseases specialist Professor Sanjaya Senanayake. ÅEÄÅEThereÅEÄÅEs a lot of incentive for cruises to look after and maintain a clean environment. We know that more than 20 million people in the world travel on cruises in a year and a lot of them have a wonderful time,ÅEÄÅE said Prof Senanayake, who is with the Australian National University. RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED ON PASSENGERS Beside making itinerary changes, cruises liners are restricting some passengers, based on their nationality and recent travel history.   Regent Seven Seas Cruise said that guests who hold a Chinese, Hong Kong or Macau passport, regardless of where they reside, will not be allowed to board its ships until Apr 8. Meanwhile, Cunard and Princess Cruises said that any passenger who has travelled through China, Macau or Hong Kong within 14 days of the start of the cruise will not be permitted to board the vessel. As a further precautionary measure, Cunard said any passenger who has travelled fr""hrough Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Singapore or Malaysia within 14 days of embarkation will be subject to enhanced pre-boarding screening to determine whether permission is given to embark. ENHANCED DISINFECTION PROTOCOLS Cruise lines have also intensified environmental disinfection on board, in addition to existing cleaning and sanitation protocols. For Princess Cruises, a spokesperson told CNA that its ships and medical staff are well equipped to prevent and contain the spread of contagiousÅEÄØillnesses, includingÅEÄØcoronavirus. ÅEÄÅEWe are taking extra precautions andÅEÄØare beingÅEÄØguidedÅEÄØin consultation withÅEÄØinternational and localÅEÄØhealthÅEÄØauthorities,ÅEÄÅE the spokesperson""g the precautions that are being taken include enhanced screeningÅEÄØofÅEÄØguestsÅEÄØand crew, as well as temperature checks for those with fever or respiratory symptoms. When a passenger exhibits symptoms of the virus while onboard, Regent Seven Seas Cruises said they could be screened for the coronavirus and may be subjected to potential quarantine and disembarkation. For passengers who were on board the Diamond Princess that have been under quarantine, Princess Cruise Line said that its guests will ""eive a full refund of cruise expenses"" considering the ""extraordinary circumstances"". These expenses include cruise fares, hotels expenses before and after the cruise and air transfers. Passengers will also receive a 100 per cent future cruise credit equal to the fare they paid for the voyage, redeemable before Feb 28. CRUISE TERMINALS SHUT, SCREENING MEASURES ENHANCED Some cruise terminals have been shut for now, while others have stepped up screening measures.   Hong Kong has closed off its two cruise terminals: Kai Tak and Ocean. Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam made the announcement as part of measures to suspend 10 out of 13 border crossings with mainland China, in a bid to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

18 Feb 2020 07:47AM,"China's COVID-19 death toll passes 1,800","meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The toll from China's coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,868 on Tuesday (Feb 18) after 98 more people died, according to the National Health Commission. Nearly 72,500 people nationwide have been infected by the new COVID-19 strain of the virus, which first emerged in December before spiralling into a nationwide epidemic. There were 1,886 new cases reported Tuesday - a decline on Monday's figure, and the lowest single-day figure of new cases so far this month. Most of the deaths were in Hubei province, the hard-hit epicentre of the outbreak, with five reported elsewhere in the country. Hubei has been locked down to try to contain the virus, with tens of millions of people placed under effective quarantine in the province. The number of new cases reported outside Hubei province was just 79, down from 890 on Feb 4. It marks the lowest number of new cases outside the virus-struck province since Jan 23. China's national health authority has said the declining numbers are a sign that the outbreak is under control. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the trend ""must be interpreted very cautiously"". ""Trends can change as new populations are affected. It is too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table,"" he told reporters on Monday. Chinese health officials have urged patients who recovered from the coronavirus to donate blood so that plasma can be extracted to treat others who are critically ill. Plasma from patients who have recovered from a spell of pneumonia triggered by COVID-19 contains antibodies that can help reduce the virus load in critically ill patients, an official from the National Health Commission told a press briefing Monday. More than 12,000 people have recovered and been discharged, according to health commission figures.

The majority of these calls, within the timeframe of about a month, were made by members of the public, while some came from general practitioners and polyclinics. Also announced on Wednesday: All SCDF ambulance crew will now don full personal protective equipment (PPE) while attending to all cases. While ambulance crew were already donning PPE when dealing with suspected COVD-19 cases prior to Singapore˚Ä˚s risk assessment being raised DORSCON Orange, these new guidelines now apply to all medical cases, said SCDF. Speaking to reporters during a visit to the SCDF headquarters where he met personnel who have responded to the novel coronavirus cases, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Home Affairs Amrin Amin urged the public not to be alarmed if they see SCDF ambulance crew in PPE. ˚Ä˚(The Government) has taken certain measures. One of the measures is we have raised the DORSCON level ... And as a result, all emergency medical crew will be wearing personal protective equipment,˚Ä˚ he said. ˚Ä˚This is required of them. The public should not be alarmed, they will be wearing PPE when responding to all calls, not just responding to a suspect novel coronavirus (case).˚Ä˚ Currently, the SCDF operations centre triages cases, with operators checking whether callers display possible symptoms as well as have a travel history to China. If they suspect a COVID-19 case, this particular information will be conveyed to the ambulance crew. Members of the ambulance crew will then make a phone call to the suspected case to further confirm this information. After conveying the suspect case to the hospital, a device will be used to decontaminate the ambulance - with the process lasting about 20 minutes while the crew removes and disposes their PPE.   ÅEÄÅEWe have been preparing for this situation, we have got people on standby, we are managing quite OK,ÅEÄÅE added Mr Amrin, when asked about how the SCDF has coped so far. Singapore reported two more confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus on Tuesday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) had said in a daily update. One had worked at the same location as another Bangladeshi coronavirus patient, the other is a Singapore permanent resident who lives in Johor Bahru and works at Resorts World Sentosa Casino.

18 Feb 2020 12:32AM,Chinese doctors 'using plasma therapy' on COVID-19 patients,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SHANGHAI: Doctors in Shanghai are using infusions of blood plasma from people who have recovered from the coronavirus to treat those still battling the infection, reporting some encouraging preliminary results, a Chinese professor said on Monday (Feb 17). A top emergency expert at the World Health Organization (WHO) said later that using convalescent plasma was a ""very valid"" approach to test, but that it was important to get the timing right to maximise the boost to a patient's immunity. The coronavirus epidemic is believed to have originated in a seafood market in the central city of Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, and has so far killed 1,770 people and infected more than 70,000 in mainland China. China's financial hub of Shanghai on Monday had 332 infected cases, one of whom died in recent weeks. Lu Hongzhou, professor and co-director of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre, said that 184 cases were still hospitalised, including 166 mild cases, while 18 were in serious and critical conditions.   He said the hospital had set up a special clinic to administer plasma therapy and was selecting patients who were willing to donate. The blood would be screened to check if he or she had other diseases like hepatitis B or C, he added. ""We are positive that this method can be very effective in our patients,"" he said. There are no fully licensed treatments or vaccines against the new coronavirus, and the process of developing and testing drugs can take many months and even years. 'VERY IMPORTANT AREA' Convalescent plasma has been proven ""effective and life-saving"" against other infectious diseases, including rabies and diphtheria, Dr Mike Ryan, head of WHO's health emergencies programme, told reporters in Geneva. ""It is a very important area to pursue,"" Ryan said. ""Because what hyperimmune globulin does is it concentrates the antibodies in a recovered patient. You are essentially giving the new victim's immune system a boost of antibodies to hopefully get them through the very difficult phase. ""So it must be given at the right time, because it mops up the virus in the system, and it just gives the new patient's immune system a vital push at the time it needs it. But it has to be carefully timed and it's not always successful."" Ryan added: ""So it is a very important area of discovery, and I believe they are starting trials on that in China. But it is a very valid way to explore therapeutics, especially when we don't have vaccines and we don't have specific antivirals."" As well as using plasma therapies, the Chinese doctors are also trying antiviral drugs licensed for use against other infections to see if they might help. Scientists are testing two antiviral drugs and preliminary results are due in weeks, while the head of a Wuhan hospital had said plasma infusions from recovered patients had shown some encouraging preliminary results.

14 Feb 2020 06:12AM,Commentary: Fighting fear is key part in battling COVID-19,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners A perceived lack of transparency and accountability has seen governments around the world deal with trust issues as they tackle the outbreak, says Eugene K B Tan. SINGAPORE: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak will eventually come to an end ˚Ä˚ hopefully sooner rather than later. But the impact of the outbreak, be it to governments, healthcare systems, the economy, people˚Ä˚s lives, may linger for some time to come. However, as countries endeavour to deal with the public health threat, they will also have to inspire and provide confidence that they (and the people) are equal to the task. Unfortunately, fear of the virus has spread faster than the virus itself. SELF-CENTRED ATTITUDES IN SINGAPORE In Singapore, this has resulted in people engaging in self-centred or irrational behaviour, which often make matters worse. The irresponsible use of social media has given virility to fear and panic. Notwithstanding the valiant efforts by frontline healthcare, security, and other professionals, a foreboding sense of dread or even apocalyptic premonition appears to have developed over the outbreak. For example, last weekend we saw people heading in droves to supermarkets to panic buy and hoard basic necessities and essentials. Face masks, bread, rice, formula milk, instant noodles, and even toilet paper, were some of the more coveted items. Besides the panic-buying, some Singaporeans also felt entitled to frown upon nurses in their uniforms using public transport. A social media post by Education Minister Ong Ye Kung on Feb 10 pointed out that people were also shunning Victoria Junior College students in uniforms because one of its teachers was recently reported infected with the coronavirus.   Such social distancing measures are not only socially irresponsible but will fuel exclusionary and dehumanising responses against certain groups. Previously, it was xenophobic reactions to mainland Chinese in our midst; now, it˚Ä˚s nurses using public transport and refusing to serve students. Might others in the frontline combating the outbreak and those who recover from the virus be next? PUBLIC CONFIDENCE LOST ELSEWHERE Elsewhere in the world, there have been examples of what can happen when there is a lack of general trust in efforts to address the outbreak. In China, public trust in the management of the threat is critically low primarily due to an initial cover-up by the provincial authorities. Not only was precious time lost in preventing the spread but it accelerated many more infections within and without China. There remain concerns China has been vastly undercounting cases of the virus. Dr Li Wenliang, the whistleblower doctor in Wuhan, had in December last year first raised a red-flag on a mysterious virus infecting people in the city but was quickly silenced. He had said in a subsequent interview: If the officials had disclosed information about the epidemic earlier ... I think it would have been a lot better. There should be more openness and transparency. Similarly, distrust in the Hong Kong government˚Ä˚s strategy prompted protests and strikes by healthcare workers to demand full border closure with the mainland to stem the infections. In South Korea, the not-in-my-backyard attitudes have emerged as residents in two towns protested when the government planned to quarantine Korean evacuees from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, in their towns. This was primarily because of poor initial communication by the government in explaining the rationale of the move and to assure residents that their safety is of priority.   Such protests also emerged in Natuna in Indonesia where the country has quarantined about 280 citizens and flight crew evacuated from Wuhan. It did not help matters that the Indonesian Health Minister˚Ä˚s claims that the country has taken all the precautions needed to maintain zero cases was met with wide public ridicule, cynicism and disbelief. The government˚Ä˚s nonchalance has raised severe doubts whether it is ready to tackle the virus. THE CURIOUS CASE OF SINGAPORE As such, the reaction of Singaporeans in these aspects is curious. The Government here has done relatively well in keeping communications open and fluid. Press conferences helmed by the multi-agency task force chairs, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, have provided important information and timely updates. Pre-emptive measures and swift and decisive action were and are being taken to manage the public health threat. There has also been transparency. Collectively, they provide stability and normalcy amid a rapidly evolving situation. The number of cases in Singapore appear relatively high given the aggressive and methodical approach to detecting cases. Trust that the healthcare system is well prepared, coupled with free medical treatment for those infected with the virus and financially assisting those in isolation have incentivised those unwell to come forward. The containment of clusters of local transmission has helped prevent the virus from spreading. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted in his remarks to the nation last Saturday that the current outbreak may morph into widespread infection. But he also used his speech, in Malay, English and Mandarin, to calm the palpable public fear and assure Singaporeans that Singapore is prepared for the outbreak. He also contextualised this outbreak against other outbreaks in the past.   Government leaders have also come out firmly to caution against unsavoury behaviour. When the panic-buying began last Friday afternoon, several leaders had come out that evening to urge calm, explain and provide assurance that national stockpiles of essential items like rice are plenty. Supermarkets also quickly followed up and replenished stocks to assure Singaporeans that there is enough for everyone without hoarding. And when assurances werenÅEÄÅEt enough, NTUC supermarkets imposed purchase controls on some key items to prevent over-buying. Many of SingaporeÅEÄÅEs leaders, like Ministers Chan Chun Sing, Desmond Lee, Masagoes Zulkifli, Ong Ye Kung and K Shanmugam, have also called out inappropriate behaviour of shunning healthcare workers and students or engaging in xenophobia. Where needed and relevant, the Government has also used the legal tools at its disposal to thwart profiteering, disinformation and divisive comments. The fear and anxiety among ""poreans has probably little to do with a lack of trust and confidence in SingaporeÅEÄÅEs ability to fight. It is perhaps more the belief that individual self-help, on top of governmentÅEÄÅEs efforts, is preferred. Perhaps memories of the SARS episode of 2003 may have returned to instil fear. Or perhaps the fact that the virus cannot seem to be localised, contained, and is spreading means that fear is being continually stoked. But one canÅEÄÅEt levy too much blame on Singaporeans for this fear. After all, not much is still known of the virus and it was only around the Chinese New Year period that its severity dawned on us. To keep things in perspective, it is worth noting that there have been 15 million cases and 8,200 deaths worldwide",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/fear-and-panic-singapore-wuhan-virus-12425832
