- Date: 07 Feb 2020 05:27PM 07 Feb 2020 10:45PM- Title: Novel coronavirus: 3 new patients in Singapore with no China travel, link to existing cases- cases: meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: There are three new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in Singapore and none of them are linked to the existing cases or have been in China recently, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Friday (Feb 7). This brings the number of cases in the country to 33. There are now at least four patients with no recent travel history to China or links to the other cases.  A teacher was among the three new cases announced, while one of the cases went visiting during Chinese New Year after developing symptoms, said MOH. Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that authorities are now expanding their case definition and doing "proactive case finding". "This means never mind a connection to China. When they have pneumonia, I want to know if this is novel coronavirus. We are investigating more cases, so we are discovering more cases," said Mr Gan. At a press briefing on Friday, Singapore authorities raised the DORSCON (Disease Outbreak Response System Condition) code to Orange from Yellow.  This means the disease is deemed severe and spreads easily from person to person, but has not spread widely and is being contained. Moderate disruption is expected, due to measures such as quarantine and visitor restrictions at hospitals.  Seventeen of the 33 confirmed patients in Singapore were visitors from China, while another four are Singaporeans who were evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30.   Twelve are locally transmitted, of which nine can be traced back to a group of Chinese tourists from Guangxi. Two patients are now in critical condition, said MOH. They are on breathing support and do not have any other significant medical problems, said MOH director of medical services Kenneth Mak.  Two patients have been discharged, while the remaining cases are stable or improving. The second discharged patient is a woman from Wuhan who was the second confirmed case in Singapore. Mr Mak said that experts around the world are working towards understanding the nature of the new coronavirus and its transmission patterns. "All of us still recognise that the main form of spread remains by droplets and it is very important for us to recognise that most spread can occur through touch," he said.   This means touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the face, mouth or eyes with contaminated hands. He added that there have been some reports of spread from people who have yet to develop symptoms but that the evidence today shows the rate of transmission is "very low". THREE NEW CASES On Friday, MOH said that two of the new cases had been to Malaysia prior to their diagnosis. Case 31, a 53-year-old Singaporean man, had been in Malaysia on Jan 6, 11 and 17, said MOH. He reported having symptoms on Jan 23, and visited two clinics before being admitted to Changi General Hospital (CGH) on Feb 1. He is currently warded in an isolation room at CGH. He lives at Tampines Street 24 and had been to the Life Church and Missions Singapore in Paya Lebar. He had visited friends and family during Chinese New Year.   Case 33, a 39-year-old Singaporean woman, had also been in Malaysia from Jan 22 to 29. She is in isolation at Sengkang General Hospital (SKH). She reported having symptoms on Jan 30 and went to the emergency department on SKH on Feb 2 where she was admitted. JUNIOR COLLEGE TEACHER 32ND CASE The 32nd case, a 42-year-old Singaporean woman, reported symptoms on Sunday and was admitted to Parkway East Hospital on Wednesday. She works at Victoria Junior College but did not interact with colleagues or students after onset of symptoms as she was on medical leave.  The last day she was at school was Jan 31, said Ms Liew Wei Li, director of schools at the Ministry of Education (MOE). The teacher stays at Elias Road and had visited Changi Airport and the Singapore Zoo. She is currently warded in an isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). Tests for all three confirmed their 2019-nCOV infections at about 11pm on Thursday. Ms Liew added that a few colleagues and students who have been in close contact with the teacher will be given 14 days of leave of absence since last day of contact with her. The college will be thoroughly disinfecting the staff room, pantry and teaching rooms that the teacher was in and co-curricular activities will be suspended for 14 days, among other measures to prevent large-group gatherings.   UPDATE ON CASE 30 In an update on case 30, which was announced on Thursday, MOH said that the 27-year-old man reported having a fever on Jan 21 and visited a general practitioner clinic on Jan 28. The Singapore citizen, who had attended a conference in Singapore linked to a few other cases, went to another clinic for treatment on Feb 3 before being admitted to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases on Thursday. He lives at Shunfu Road and had been to Far East Square and Junction 8 shopping malls.   The business meeting at the Grand Hyatt was attended by more than 100 people, including participants from the Chinese province of Hubei. The new coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province at the end of last year has killed more than 630 people and spread around the world. The latest figures from China show there are more than 30,000 people infected in the country. A Chinese doctor who was punished after raising the alarm about the virus died from the pathogen on Friday, sparking an outpouring of grief and anger in China over the worsening crisis.

A breakdown of the 17,000 cases provided by Chinese authorities found that 82 per cent of the cases were mild, 15 per cent severe and 3 per cent critical, said WHO epidemiologist Maria van Kerkhove. Referring to overall numbers, she added: "We know that 2 per cent - or less than 2 per cent now - of the reported cases have died." At least 34,000 have now been infected globally by the virus, which has killed more than 700 people, mainly in China. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that some countries were still failing to share clinical data on confirmed cases of the virus and urged them to do so "immediately". "We have a common enemy which is dangerous and which can bring serious upheaval, social, political and economic. This is the time to fight it and in unison," said Tedros, speaking to WHO's executive board on Friday. Tedros also pointed out that between Wednesday and Thursday, the number of reported cases of the virus declined. He said this was "good news but we caution against reading too much into that - the numbers could go up again". Tedros added that there was a shortage of masks and other protective equipment against the novel virus. WHO said prices for some items were up to 20 times higher than normal, and Tedros told reporters the problem was being made worse by "inappropriate use" of masks by people who were neither sick nor medical staff. "There are now depleted stockpiles and backlogs of four to six months. Global stocks of masks and respirators are now insufficient to meet the needs of WHO and our partners," he said, adding: "There is a moral issue here." After speaking to a supply chain group of producers and distributors on Friday, Tedros praised those companies that have promised to sell only to medical staff. "There is limited stock of PPE and we need to make sure we get it to the people who need it most in the places that need it most," he said, warning against "stockpiling of PPE in countries and areas where transmission is low". WHO earlier this week said it had started sending masks, gloves, respirators, protective isolation gowns and test kits to countries requiring assistance.

- Date: 07 Feb 2020 03:30AM 07 Feb 2020 09:58AM- Title: It's too early to say coronavirus peaking in China: WHO- cases: meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners GENEVA: The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday (Feb 6) it was too early to say that China's coronavirus outbreak was peaking, but noted that the country had recorded its first day of a drop in the number of new infections. The death toll from the virus in mainland China jumped on Thursday to more than 630, with more than 30,000 confirmed infections inside the world's second-largest economy. That number had risen by nearly 4,000 from Wednesday to Thursday. Dr Mike Ryan, WHO's top emergencies expert, said it was very difficult to make predictions on the course of the disease first reported in the central city of Wuhan in late December, noting: "We are still in the middle of an intense outbreak. "There are cycles of transmission, and we may see those cases increase in the coming days. But at least for the moment, things are stable," Ryan told a news conference. "But 4,000 cases or nearly, 3,700 coronavirus cases confirmed in a single day, is nothing to celebrate and is certainly still a great worry," he said. There is a constant rise in infections in the epicentre of Hubei province, which accounts for about 80 per cent of cases, Ryan said, adding: "But we haven't seen that same acceleration in provinces outside Hubei. And equally we haven't seen that acceleration in Hong Kong, Macao, in Taiwanese people either." Earlier, the United States and China clashed over the issue of Taiwan's exclusion from WHO meetings, including the ongoing executive board, where it is represented by China, with Beijing accusing Washington of political "hype-up". "It's hard to believe just two months ago this virus was unknown to us," WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters. "We have already learned so much about it, we know its DNA, we know it can be transmitted from one person to another, we know that those most at risk are older people and those with underlying health conditions," he said. But there is still a lot to learn, including the source of the virus, its severity and ability to spread, Tedros said. Maria van Kerkhove, a WHO epidemiologist, said that the virus causes a "full spectrum of disease". "You have mild cases which look like the common cold, which have some respiratory symptoms - sore throat, runny nose, fever - all way through pneumonia. And there can be varying levels of pneumomia, all the way through multiple organ failure and death," she said, calling for further study of mild cases and how easily they can spread the virus.

One patient who was admitted to the surgical department was presumed to have infected 10 health care workers, according to the paper that was authored by doctors at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) on Friday (Feb 7). Seventeen patients who were hospitalised for other reasons also became infected by the coronavirus. A total of 138 patients got the virus in a period spanning Jan 1 to Jan 28, with hospital-associated transmission accounting for 41 per cent of all cases. The study comes just hours after a Chinese doctor who was punished for raising the alarm about the coronavirus died from the pathogen - sparking an outpouring of grief and anger over a worsening crisis that has now killed more than 630 people. Li Wenliang, 34, sent out a message about the new coronavirus to colleagues on December 30 in Wuhan but was later among a group of people summoned by police for "rumor-mongering." He later contracted the disease while treating a patient. Of the 40 infected health care workers in the JAMA study, 31 worked on general wards, seven in the emergency department, and two in the ICU. The example of the patient presumed to have infected 10 health workers highlighted the high level of danger within hospitals during the first phase of the epidemic, even though overall it is currently estimated that each patient infects on average 2.2 others. "If true, then this confirms that some patients are likely to be far more infectious than others, and this poses further difficulties in managing their cases," said Michael Head, a global health expert at the University of Southampton said in a comment to the UK's Science Media Centre. Medical staff at the epicenter of the virus are overstretched and lack sufficient protective gear, the deputy governor of Hubei province admitted Thursday.

Both cases have recent travel history to Wuhan and there is currently no evidence of community spread in Singapore, MOH added. "The two new cases are stable currently, and we are continuing to monitor their health. As for the 16 previously announced cases, none is critically ill. All of them remain in stable condition, and most are improving," MOH said. The 17th case is a 47-year-old female Singapore citizen who travelled to Wuhan. "She was one of the Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30, and arrived in Singapore on the same day. She was asymptomatic when she boarded the flight. "Upon arrival at Changi Airport, she was found to have a fever during medical screening, and was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID)," MOH said. The woman then tested positive for Wuhan coronavirus infection on Jan 31 at about 11pm. She is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID. The 18th case is a 31-year-old female Chinese national who arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 22. She tested positive for infection on Feb 1 at about 2pm and is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID. MOH said that it has initiated epidemiological investigations and contact tracing to identify individuals who had close contact with the cases. In an update on the 16th confirmed case, which was announced on Jan 31, MOH said the 38-year-old male Chinese national arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 22. He is currently warded in an isolation room at the Singapore General Hospital. The man reported that he was asymptomatic during his flight to Singapore and subsequently developed symptoms on Jan 23. He reported that he had stayed at his home at Nathan Road until Jan 29, when he took a taxi to SGH. He was classified as a suspect case and immediately isolated. Subsequent test results confirmed 2019-nCoV infection on Jan 31 at about 2pm, MOH said.  As of 12pm on Feb 1, MOH said 231 of the suspect cases have tested negative for the Wuhan coronavirus. Test results for the remaining 25 cases are pending and contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once identified, MOH said it will closely monitor all close contacts and quarantine them for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient as a precautionary measure. All other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status. So far, MOH said it has identified 245 close contacts. Of the 177 who are still in Singapore, 172 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining five close contacts.  MOH also advised Singaporeans to defer all travel to Hubei province and all non-essential travel to mainland China. "All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell. "Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (eg. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit," MOH said.  MOH added that it will continue to monitor the situation closely. "As medical practitioners are on the lookout for cases with pneumonia who have recently been in China, Singapore is likely to see more suspect cases that will need to be investigated." Singapore on Friday announced that it will widen travel restrictions to include all new visitors with recent travel history to China. China also said it will send charter planes to bring home citizens from Hubei who are overseas "as soon as possible". The announcement came as a number of airlines, including Singapore Airlines and Scoot, announced they were halting or reducing flights to China as the country tackles the spread of the virus. In a bid to contain the possible spread of the virus, a total of 967 students and employees from schools in Singapore have been placed on leave of absence because of their recent travel history to China. On Saturday, authorities began distributing packs of four surgical masks for each Singapore household. There have been long queues for masks at pharmacies and retailers across the country.  Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing on Thursday reassured people that Singapore will have enough masks, provided the supply is managed "appropriately".

- Date: 01 Feb 2020 07:35PM 03 Feb 2020 11:13PM- Title: Wuhan coronavirus: 2 new imported cases, no evidence of community spread, says MOH- cases: meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Saturday (Feb 1) confirmed two additional imported cases of the Wuhan coronavirus, bringing the total to 18 cases. Both cases have recent travel history to Wuhan and there is currently no evidence of community spread in Singapore, MOH added. "The two new cases are stable currently, and we are continuing to monitor their health. As for the 16 previously announced cases, none is critically ill. All of them remain in stable condition, and most are improving," MOH said. The 17th case is a 47-year-old female Singapore citizen who travelled to Wuhan. "She was one of the Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30, and arrived in Singapore on the same day. She was asymptomatic when she boarded the flight. "Upon arrival at Changi Airport, she was found to have a fever during medical screening, and was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID)," MOH said. The woman then tested positive for Wuhan coronavirus infection on Jan 31 at about 11pm. She is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID. The 18th case is a 31-year-old female Chinese national who arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 22.

- Date: 02 Feb 2020 04:24PM 03 Feb 2020 12:53AM- Title: Wuhan coronavirus: Licence fees waived for hotels, travel agents and tour guides, cleaning costs subsidised- cases: meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Licence fees for hotels, travel agents and tour guides will be waived as part of measures to help the tourism sector in Singapore that has been “directly affected” by the Wuhan coronavirus, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) said on Sunday (Feb 2). STB will also defray the cleaning costs of hotels that provided accommodation to the confirmed and suspected cases of the coronavirus infections. These schemes are the first steps in a wider set of measures to help tourism businesses “mitigate the immediate impact” of the coronavirus outbreak, STB added.   These measures come after feedback from trade associations and chambers, said Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing. He said at the Oasia Hotel Downtown: "I just want to assure the businesses and our workers that the survival of the businesses, and in the turn, the sustainability of the jobs for Singaporeans will be our primary focus." Oasia Hotel Downtown was where Singapore's 13th confirmed case of the Wuhan virus stayed prior to being tested positive for the coronavirus. The 73-year-old arrived in Singapore on Jan 21 and developed symptoms seven days later. Mr Chan told reporters that Singaporeans should be "mentally prepared" for the impact of the coronavirus to be "wider, deeper and longer" than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. This is because China's trade with Singapore and its GDP have both gone up four times since then. "What we must be mentally prepared for is that the impact of any disruption to the Chinese economy, to the supply chains, is likely to be much wider, much deeper, because of the interlinkages with the global economy - certainly with the Singapore economy," he said.   "The tourism sector has already been directly affected by the novel coronavirus, due to a decline in visitor arrivals, especially from China," STB said in its media release on Sunday. Tourists from China account for about 20 per cent of Singapore’s total international visitor arrivals, with about 3.6 million visitors to Singapore in 2019, the tourism board added. Earlier this week, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong announced wider travel restrictions to include all new visitors – regardless of nationality – with recent travel history to China. These visitors will also not be allowed to transit in Singapore, as part of restrictions that came into effect at 11.59pm on Saturday. Those with Chinese passports, with the exception of Singapore permanent residents (PRs) and long-term pass holders, will also not be allowed to enter Singapore. All forms of new visas to Chinese passport holders have been suspended, and Singapore’s status as a visa-free transit facility has also been suspended for those with Chinese passports. HELP WITH CLEANING AND LICENCE FEES There have been 18 confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore. Of the 18, 16 are travellers from Wuhan and two are Singaporeans who were evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30. The tourism board said hotels that provided accommodation to suspected and confirmed cases will get help with their environmental cleaning and disinfection costs. “STB will cover up to 50 per cent of third-party professional cleaning fees, capped at S$20,000 per establishment for hotels with confirmed cases; and S$10,000 per establishment for hotels with suspected cases,” the board added. This will be backdated to Jan 23, when the first confirmed case in Singapore was detected. Licence fees for hotels for the rest of 2020 will also be waived by the Hotels Licensing Board. “Similarly, travel agents and tourist guides whose licences are due for renewal in 2020 will not need to pay to renew their licence fees,” STB said. Chief executive of STB Keith Tan said: "Over the past week, STB has been in close contact with our tourism partners to understand their difficulties and to assess the impact. "We know the situation is likely to persist, and recognise we need to move quickly to support the industry and build confidence. "STB will continue to identify targeted and effective ways to support the tourism industry so that they are well-positioned to grow swiftly once we start to recover." Full details of the overall package of relief measures will be announced at Budget 2020 on Feb 18.   The Government is "keenly aware" that some front-line workers are "particularly worried" about coming into contact with unwell guests or customers, added Manpower Minister Josephine Teo. She said that the Singapore National Employers Federation and the Singapore Business Federation will issue an advisory to employers with such workers. "(The advisory will explain) what they can do to provide these workers with support. They need guidance on how to deal with unwell customers, and the advisory will give some specific suggestions," she said. Workers who are placed on leave of absences are not unwell and should not be evicted by landlords, co-tenants or dormitory operators, added Mrs Teo. There have been reports of such evictions, Communications and Information Minister S Iswaran had said on Friday. "There's really no need to do so. It is completely unhelpful. And this is a time where we actually need to provide care and support to each other," Mrs Teo said. She noted that placing workers on leave is an extra precaution to minimise social contact. "We must always be mindful that even as we take these extra precautions, we should be supportive to the people who are affected by the leave of absence," she said.

Malaysia and South Korea have as of Friday (Feb 7) confirmed three cases of the novel coronavirus linked to that conference. The UK also has one patient with the virus who had travelled to Singapore, although no link to the conference has been reported. The authorities in Singapore have not revealed which company organised the conference, but it has been reported that it was an event by Servomex, which describes itself as a "provider of reliable, accurate and stable gas measurements". A source has also told CNA that the event was organised by the company, which was founded in the UK and has worldwide offices. CNA contacted Servomex's office in Singapore for comment, but the company did not respond. There were over 31,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus worldwide as of Friday morning. There have been two deaths reported outside of mainland China so far, one in the Philippines and one in Hong Kong. This is what we know about the four international cases linked to Singapore: MALAYSIA WHO: A 42-year-old man from Selangor was the first Malaysian citizen to contract the novel coronavirus. DETAILS: Singapore's Health Ministry said on Tuesday that the man had been in Singapore from Jan 16 to Jan 23 for the business meeting, which also had Chinese nationals in attendance. The Malaysian developed symptoms a week after returning to Malaysia, and tested positive for the virus on Feb 3. Malaysia's Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad on Tuesday said that the man was in a stable condition and receiving treatment at a Sungai Buloh Hospital. SOUTH KOREA WHO: A 36-year-old man and a 38-year-old man who attended the conference in Singapore. DETAILS: Media reports on Wednesday said that the men had come into contact with the Malaysian who had tested positive for the virus. The 38-year-old developed a fever two days after he returned to South Korea. Although he visited a hospital, he was not suspected to be infected as he had not been to China recently, reported the Korea Joongang Daily. However, he did not get better and visited two other hospitals. He received a call from the Malaysian on Monday, who told him that he had contracted the coronavirus. The South Korean then contacted a community health centre on Tuesday and was later tested positive for the virus. UNITED KINGDOM WHO: A middle-aged man who travelled to Singapore. DETAILS: He became the UK's third confirmed case of the novel coronavirus, reported The Guardian on Thursday. He is the first British national to contract the virus. After confirming that he had travelled to the UK from outside China, UK officials placed doctors on alert for cases of people returning from countries previously not considered a risk, The Guardian reported. He is the fourth overseas case linked to Singapore. TIMES CULTURAL ARTS LION DANCE TROUPE Lion dance troupe Times Cultural Arts performed at the Servomex conference at the Grand Hyatt hotel level one ballroom in the early morning of Jan 20. A member of the troupe confirmed the performance took place and told CNA on Thursday that they have not been in contact with any authorities after performing at the hotel. “We didn’t have much concern because it is just a five minute concert. And we didn’t have contact with the guests, because (we were) performing on a stage.” He added that they were engaged by an events company, and did not interact directly with any delegates. The lion dance troupe uploaded a series of photos of the performance on Facebook on Jan 20. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Copyright© Mediacorp 2020. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

The four Thais included a couple who visited Japan and two drivers who picked up Chinese passengers in Thailand, Suwannachai Wattanayingcharoenchai, director-general of the Department of Disease Control, told reporters. It was not clear whether the couple contracted the virus in Japan or after returning, Suwannachai said. One of the infected Thai drivers, a 70-year-old, also had tuberculosis and was transferred into government care from a private hospital on Monday with worse condition than the others. The other driver was tracked down by Thai authorities after being identified as one of the people in contact with an infected Chinese tourist, Suwannachai said. Thailand confirmed its first case of human-to-human transmission on Friday when a taxi driver tested positive. Thailand's total 25 cases consist of six Thais and 19 Chinese. Seventeen remain in hospital and eight have gone home, according to the health official. Earlier on Tuesday, South Korea reported a 42-year-old woman has tested positive for coronavirus after visiting Thailand. It was not clear yet where she had contracted the virus.

Here is what we know so far about the patients, including when and how they arrived in Singapore, and their movements since.   1) 66-YEAR-OLD MAN FROM WUHAN A 66-year-old Chinese man, a Wuhan resident, was the first confirmed case of the Wuhan virus in Singapore.  He arrived in Singapore with his family on Jan 20, after flying in from Guangzhou on China Southern flight CZ351. He reported having a sore throat while on the flight but no fever. He developed a fever the next day and began coughing.   After arriving in Singapore, the man checked in to Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa. On Jan 22, he told hotel staff that he was unwell and was taken to Singapore General Hospital, where he was isolated and diagnosed with pneumonia. He was identified to the Ministry of Health as a suspected Wuhan virus case at 10pm. On Jan 23 at 6pm, he tested positive for the new coronavirus. The Health Ministry then moved to identify the man's close contacts. A total of 46 were identified, with 17 contacted.

Prior to hospital admission, he was not in any infant care facility and was cared for at home. 29) 41-YEAR-OLD SINGAPOREAN MAN The 29th case is a 41-year-old Singaporean with no recent travel history to China and who does not appear to be linked with previous confirmed cases. He was admitted to Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital on Feb 3 and was confirmed to have the virus at about 11pm on Feb 5. The man said he had developed a fever on Jan 28 and visited a GP clinic the next day. On Jan 30, he sought treatment at another GP clinic before being admitted to Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. Epidemiological investigations and contact tracing are ongoing to identify individuals who had close contact with this patient, and to establish any contact he may have had with confirmed cases in Singapore or travellers from mainland China, said MOH. 30) 27-YEAR-OLD SINGAPOREAN MAN Case 30 is a 27-year-old Singaporean man who also had no recent travel history to China. He is one of the four Singapore residents who are being investigated at NCID after attending a private business meeting at Grand Hyatt Singapore from Jan 20 to Jan 22. The meeting included participants from China, including Hubei province, as well as confirmed cases from Malaysia and South Korea. Subsequent test results confirmed infection with the novel coronavirus on Feb 6 at about 2pm. 31) 53-YEAR-OLD SINGAPOREAN MAN The 31st case of infection in Singapore is a 53-year-old Singapore citizen who had no recent travel history to China, but visited Malaysia on Jan 6, 11 and 17. He reported symptoms on Jan 23 and visited a general practitioner on the same day. He then visited another clinic on Jan 28 and was admitted to CGH on Feb 1, where he is currently warded in isolation. He was confirmed positive for the virus on Feb 6. The man lives at Tampines Street 24 and had been to The Life Church and Missions Singapore in Paya Lebar prior to admission. He also went to visit family and friends during Chinese New Year. 32) 42-YEAR-OLD SINGAPOREAN WOMAN The 32nd case is a 42-year-old who had no recent travel history to China. She reported symptoms on Feb 2 and was admitted to Parkway East Hospital three days later. Coronavirus infection was confirmed on Feb 6.

In a circular dated Feb 6, the Phoenix Medical Group said the man had visited its clinic in Seletar last Thursday and again on Monday. The man appeared “quite ill” with gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms, as well as a moderate fever when he visited the clinic on Monday, and was asked to go to the emergency department, the group said. He did not fulfil the Health Ministry’s (MOH) criteria for a suspected case of the coronavirus and as such was not sent to the hospital using a dedicated ambulance service, the circular said. MOH then brought the case to Phoenix Medical’s attention at around midday on Thursday for active contact tracing, it added, noting the group was informed that his infection was confirmed later that night. The 41-year-old, who is a Singapore citizen, had no recent travel history to mainland China and no known links with the other confirmed cases of the virus. In its statement on Thursday, MOH said the man had developed a fever on Jan 28, five days after the first confirmed case of the coronavirus here was reported. The ministry said that he had visited a general practitioner’s clinic on Jan 29, and subsequently sought treatment at another clinic on Jan 30, before being admitted to the Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital on Monday. MOH did not name the clinics. On Wednesday at about 11pm, test results confirmed the man was infected by the coronavirus. “Epidemiological investigations and contact tracing are ongoing to identify individuals who had close contact with the case, and to establish any link he may have had with confirmed cases in Singapore or travellers from mainland China,” MOH said in its statement. “We are interviewing the patient and his close contacts, and investigating the locations he had recently been to,” it added. Dr Chua Hshan Cher, a general practitioner at the clinic, said they initially considered the possibility of a coronavirus infection to be low as he did not meet the criteria stipulated by MOH. The patient was tested for dengue fever and influenza last Thursday, both of which came back negative, he added. They also considered the possibility that he might have sepsis. When he came back on Monday, his symptoms had worsened and he developed gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite and loose stools. "We referred him to hospital because there was progression of symptoms, no response to treatment and the patient appeared to be unwell," Dr Chua said. In the Phoenix Medical Group’s circular – signed by three of the clinic’s doctors – it said all the rooms, corridors, table tops, seats and examination couches had been "deep cleansed" between 6pm and 9pm on Thursday. The clinic had also engaged the mall operator's help in changing all the filters in the air conditioners, said Dr Chua. "We've also implemented a strict recommendation of daily temperature taking, hourly sanitation and ensuring that any staff who feels unwell is sent home immediately." He added that masks are compulsory for staff.   Previous measures include a questionnaire asking patients if they have travelled to China in the past two weeks or had contact with anyone who had been to China within the same time period. They also ask for patients for their occupation, so as to identify frontline jobs that may expose the patients to potential Chinese visitors. The doctor who attended to the man is on a voluntary leave of absence until Feb 17, and is currently well, it noted. “We would like to assure members of the public, patients and well-meaning family and friends that we will remain vigilant against the scourge of the novel coronavirus and continue our fight against it,” Phoenix Medical said in the circular.

The patients are of Chinese and Filipino nationalities, said the ministry. The United Arab Emirates, a major international transit hub, had suspended flights to and from China, except for Beijing, from Feb 3, following the outbreak of the new coronavirus in China. The UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention, MoHAP, announced today two new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases to seven in the country.#mohap_uae #coronavirus pic.twitter.com/y8C7MC16xA  The new coronavirus that emerged in a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of last year has killed 722 people and infected more than 34,546 people in China. Outside China, there have been more than 320 infections reported in nearly 30 other places. There have also been two deaths, one in the Philippines and the other in Hong Kong. Both of those victims were Chinese nationals. On Saturday, it was reported the virus had claimed its first two foreign victims - a US citizen who was diagnosed with the novel coronavirus and a Japanese man suspected to have the infection. Both died in Wuhan. The total death toll is poised to pass the 774 deaths recorded globally during the 2002-2003 pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus that jumped from animals to humans in China. During the SARS outbreak, the number of reported cases was 8,098, suggesting a far lower transmission rate than the latest coronavirus, but a higher mortality rate.

- Date: 08 Feb 2020 01:28AM 08 Feb 2020 06:29AM- Title: Outrage grows over death of Chinese doctor who sounded coronavirus alarm- cases: meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING/SHANGHAI: A Chinese doctor reprimanded for warning of a "SARS-like" coronavirus before it was officially recognised died of the illness on Friday, triggering anger at the government. The death of Li Wenliang, 34, came as President Xi Jinping reassured the United States and the World Health Organization (WHO) of transparency and maximum effort to combat the virus. Beijing's communist leadership has sealed off cities, cancelled flights and closed factories to limit an epidemic roiling the world's second biggest economy to the alarm of global markets and businesses dependent on Chinese supply lines. The epicentre region of Hubei is in lockdown and the capital Beijing resembles a ghost town. Deaths in mainland China reached 637 on Friday, with a total of 31,211 cases, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva, warning of a worldwide shortage of gowns, masks and other protective equipment. "For the last two days there had been fewer reported infections in China, which is good news, but we caution against reading too much into that," he told the WHO Executive Board. "The numbers could go up again." Virus concerns swiped world markets on Friday, but failed to stand in the way of the best week for stocks since June and the strongest for the dollar since August. With Chinese buyers rejecting shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) due to the epidemic, traders rushed to find alternative locations amid record low prices. US President Donald Trump, after speaking to Xi by phone, said China was showing "great discipline". "Nothing is easy, but he will be successful, especially as the weather starts to warm & the virus hopefully becomes weaker, and then gone," Trump said on Twitter.   OPTHALMOLOGIST REBUKED Ophthalmologist Li was among eight people reprimanded by police in the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, for spreading "illegal and false" information. His social media warnings of a new "SARS-like" coronavirus - a reference to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which killed almost 800 people around the world in 2002-2003 after originating in China - angered police. China was accused of trying to cover up SARS. Li was made to sign a letter on Jan 3, saying he had "severely disrupted social order" and was threatened with charges. Social media users called him a hero and shared a selfie of him lying on a hospital bed wearing an oxygen respirator and holding up his Chinese identification card. One image showed the message "farewell Li Wenliang" etched into snow on a riverbank. "Wuhan indeed owes Li Wenliang an apology," said Hu Xijin, editor of the government-backed Global Times tabloid. Rights group Amnesty International called his death a "tragic reminder" of how China's preoccupation with stability made it suppress vital information. There were signs discussion of his death was being censored. After briefly trending on Weibo, the topics "the Wuhan government owes doctor Li Wenliang an apology" and "we want free speech" yielded no search results.   "UNACCEPTABLE STIGMA" The virus has spread around the world, with 320 cases now in 27 countries and regions outside mainland China, a Reuters tally of official statements shows. WHO emergency expert Mike Ryan called out stigma being attached to the virus amid reports of Asians being shunned in the West. "The unnecessary, unhelpful profiling of individuals based on ethnicity is utterly and completely unacceptable and it needs to stop," he said. The outbreak could have spread from bats to humans via illegal traffic of pangolins, the world's only scaly mammals, Chinese researchers said, sparking some scepticism. Two deaths have been reported outside mainland China, in Hong Kong and the Philippines, but how deadly and contagious the virus is remains unclear, prompting countries to quarantine hundreds of people and cut travel links with China. There were 41 new cases among about 3,700 people quarantined in a cruise ship off Japan, taking the total to 61. Chinese-ruled Hong Kong quarantined for a third day a cruise ship with 3,600 on board. And about two dozen sick passengers aboard a cruise ship that arrived off New Jersey in the United States were screened for the coronavirus, with four sent to a local hospital out of "an abundance of caution," the local mayor said. The head of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice, Li Fuying, told reporters that people deliberately concealing contacts or refusing isolation could be punished with death.

- Date: 04 Feb 2020 07:04AM 04 Feb 2020 12:54PM- Title: China coronavirus death toll soars past 400- cases: meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The number of confirmed deaths from the coronavirus outbreak spiked to 426 in China, after authorities in Hubei province reported 64 new fatalities and Hong Kong reported its first fatality on Tuesday (Feb 4). In its daily update, figures from the health commission in Hubei, which has been hit hardest by the virus, also showed a sharp increase in confirmed infections with 3,235 new cases. That puts the national total at more than 20,400, based on numbers previously issued by the central government.   The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency, although experts say much is still unknown about the pathogen including its lethality. "We expect to see more cases of person-to-person spread," said Dr Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The epidemic is believed to have emerged in December from a market that sold wild game in the Hubei provincial capital Wuhan. At least 151 cases have been reported in 23 other countries and regions, including Japan, Thailand, Singapore, the United States and Britain. There has been one death outside China, in the Philippines.   With Wuhan and some other cities in virtual lockdown, travel severely restricted and China facing increasing international isolation, fears of wider economic disruption are growing; sources at the OPEC oil cartel said producers were considering cutting output by almost a third to support prices. Airlines around the world have stopped flights to parts of China. A suspension by the United Arab Emirates on Monday will affect the Gulf airlines Etihad and Emirates. The outbreak is reminiscent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a virus from the same family that emerged in China in 2002 and killed almost 800 people around the world out of the 8,000 or so who were infected. Chinese data suggest that the new virus, while much more contagious than SARS, is significantly less lethal, although such numbers can evolve rapidly. Some economists predict world economic output will be cut by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points due to China's lockdown. Countries continued to fly evacuation flights for citizens out of Wuhan. A planeload of Australians left the city on Monday and arrived in the Indian Ocean territory of Christmas Island, where they will be quarantined, media reported on Tuesday. The United States, which flew people out last week, is planning "a handful more flights" while Russia was due to start evacuating its citizens from Wuhan on Monday. The White House said China had accepted its offer to have US experts as part of a WHO mission to study and help combat the virus.

- Date: 31 Jan 2020 06:06PM 31 Jan 2020 11:26PM- Title: Wuhan coronavirus: Singapore to widen travel restrictions to all new visitors who recently travelled to mainland China- cases: meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: In an effort to minimise the risk of community spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, new visitors of any nationality with recent travel history to mainland China will not be allowed to enter Singapore, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said on Friday (Jan 31). These visitors will also not be allowed to transit in Singapore, as part of restrictions that will come into effect at 11.59pm on Saturday. Those with Chinese passports, with the exception of Singapore permanent residents (PRs) and long-term pass holders, will also not be allowed to enter Singapore. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) will, with immediate effect, suspend the issuance of all forms of new visas to those with Chinese passports. Singapore's status as a visa-free transit facility will be suspended for Chinese passport holders. Previously issued short-term and multiple-visit visas for those with Chinese passports will also be suspended. Those who hold such visas will not be allowed into Singapore during this period.   In a press release on Friday evening, the Manpower Ministry also announced that with immediate effect, it will reject all new work pass applications for foreign workers from mainland China until further notice. Renewal applications for existing work pass holders will not be affected.  Earlier this week, the restrictions only applied to new visitors who had recently travelled to China's Hubei province. However, China recently announced that the number of reported infections in the country had doubled since Jan 28 to more than 9,000 and that the likelihood of widespread community transmission in other parts of China is now high. "As a result, we are likely to see a sharper rise in the local transmission of the virus in Chinese cities beyond the Hubei province in the coming days," said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a press release on Friday. At the briefing, Mr Wong also said that Singapore residents with recent travel history to mainland China will be issued a travel advisory and asked to take a 14-day leave of absence. These include Singapore citizens, PRs as well as those with long-term passes. Commissioner of ICA Marvin Sim, who was at the briefing, said the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore will be disseminating the information to all airlines to ensure smooth implementation of the new measures. Cabin crew who have to travel to China as part of their job will not be subject to the new measures, but in consultation with the Health Ministry, will have to take precautionary measures, he said. They will only be able to enter or transit if they are well, he added. “These additional travel restrictions on top of all that we have already introduced over the past few days will enable us to limit the number of new cases here and to reduce the risk of community spread in Singapore,” said Mr Wong, who co-chairs a ministerial task force set up to deal with the coronavirus situation. Responding to a question from the media, Mr Wong stressed that the restrictions are not nationality-based. "It is not a nationality issue," he said. "The motivation is the origins of the virus and that beyond Hubei, the virus is now spreading to other parts of China - as we have said, there is assessment that this is happening." When asked for a clarification that all Chinese passport holders who are not residents of Singapore will be barred from Singapore regardless of their previous travel, Mr Wong said: "This is the policy because it is difficult to know your previous travel history." At the operational level, there may be appeals," he added. The passport is being used as a "proxy", he said. "I can imagine somebody may say 'I’m a passport holder, but I have not be in China all this while'. I think we can take that separate from the policy, and at the operational level, ICA will have to deal with these instances," he said.  Meanwhile, MOH's director of medical services Kenneth Mak said there remains no evidence of community spread. Of those suspected of having the coronavirus, 164 of them have been ruled out while test results are still pending for 49 others. “The situation remains fluid, it is constantly changing. We do not rule out taking further measures,” Mr Wong said.

SINGAPORE: The coronavirus originating from China’s Wuhan city is spreading quickly in the country as well as across borders since it was first declared on the last day of 2019. Since then, the deadly pathogen has killed more than 200 people and infected nearly 10,000 in China alone. It has also reached more than 20 places across the world, with Hong Kong, Japan and Thailand among the highest counts of confirmed cases.  In Singapore, there have been 16 confirmed cases so far, all imported. CNA asked readers to submit questions on the coronavirus outbreak and had an overwhelming response. Questions ranged from how the virus is spread and whether it will affect pregnant women and their children.  To answer these, we enlisted the help of medical experts such as those from the Duke-NUS Medical School - Professor Gregory Gray, Assistant Professor Danielle Anderson and Professor Wang Linfa, who was also part of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) emergency committee looking into the virus outbreak - as well as Professor Benjamin Neuman, chair of Biological Sciences from Texas A&M University. Their lightly edited answers are as follows: Question: What is the difference between symptoms of Wuhan virus and flu/common cold? Prof Gray: They are very similar. Clinically, it is difficult to distinguish between the two; one really needs to use laboratory-based tests in order to do so. Prof Wang: Not much. Asst Prof Anderson: The symptoms of the flu and the Wuhan coronavirus are very similar and include fever, coughing and a runny nose.   Q: Can people recover naturally from the Wuhan coronavirus just like the common cold? Prof Gray: Yes. The vast majority will fully recover after their illness. Prof Wang: Yes, and the majority do. Asst Prof Anderson: Yes, people can recover naturally following infection and the majority of patients (98 per cent) do indeed recover. But while it is possible to recover from infection, some patients can develop severe disease and pneumonia. Q: How does the virus affect pregnant women and will it be transmitted to the unborn child? Prof Wang: It is not known yet. Prof Gray: Unknown, but pregnant women are often at increased risk of respiratory infections. Asst Prof Anderson: Currently there is not enough information available to determine if there is maternal transmission to the unborn child. A pregnant woman may develop more severe disease as they are immunocompromised and are more susceptible to complications of respiratory infections. Q: How should parents protect children under the age of 1 from the coronavirus? Prof Gray: Avoid having them come in contact with the public, especially people with respiratory signs and symptoms. Q: Can the virus be spread through water such as via swimming pools? Or through one’s eyes? Prof Gray: We don’t know, but other respiratory viruses can, such as adenovirus which is a hardier type of virus. Prof Wang: Transmission through the swimming pool is unlikely unless the person is swimming very close to an infected person. Yes, it is possible to be infected through the eyes. Asst Prof Anderson: It is unlikely that the coronavirus can be spread through water, especially chlorinated swimming pools. Coronaviruses are also not known to be spread though the eyes. There is an anecdotal case of infection through the eye and, if this infection did occur, it is an extremely rare event.   Q: How are those infected with the coronavirus being treated? What’s the success rate? Prof Wang: It is mostly just normal hospital care for severe cases. I have been told all confirmed cases (of the Wuhan coronavirus) are doing well in Singapore. There are drugs being tried in China, but it is too early to scientifically gauge their success rate. Asst Prof Anderson: If a patient has respiratory symptoms they may require breathing support. In milder cases, they can be given an intravenous drip to maintain blood pressure. Fluids can also be given in cases of diarrhoea, and ibuprofen or Panadol can be used for pain relief. Prof Gray: There is no specific treatment yet recognised as effective. Success rates are being determined now for supportive care. The mortality rate is low, less than 3 per cent, and likely will be lower as more people fully recover. (According to the WHO, global fatality rate for SARS patients was at 11 per cent) Q: Is the Wuhan coronavirus going to mutate further? Prof Gray: We don’t know, but the good news is that so far the 2019-nCoV virus is not changing. Prof Wang: All viruses mutate in nature. But so far, the Wuhan coronavirus seems to be quite stable. Q: Will tropical weather affect the spread of the virus? If yes, how? Prof Gray: Ultraviolet light can often kill respiratory viruses. Prof Wang: No scientific evidence for that yet. Q: How do you think this coronavirus outbreak will end? Prof Neuman: As a person who likes to make anti-viral drugs, things that actually slow down the virus, I can say that (better weather patterns or health measures) are probably not going to be the end (of the virus outbreak). And a vaccine will probably not going to be the end. It’s old-fashioned stuff like quarantines - basically keeping infected people away from healthy people that actually beat viruses like this. The risk is there are only so many quarantine facilities available in mainland China and only so many facilities to keep people properly treated while they are being treated for the virus. So if there are too many people that turn up sick, and overwhelm the systems that are there, that is potentially a risk.   We’ve seen China build new hospitals very quickly... so I believe they realise this possible risk and are trying to combat it - which is actually very good news. Q: Can you predict how long the virus will last? Prof Gray: I don’t expect to see a quick resolution. We are seeing the epidemic expand into other countries now. Prof Wang: No expert can do such a prediction as this is a highly complex matter. Even the experts at WHO are monitoring and assessing daily. However, the next two weeks will be critical when the Chinese New Year holiday ends in China. If we see a decrease in two to three weeks, I am hopeful we can control this. Asst Prof Anderson: It is difficult to predict when the peak of infection will occur. If the quarantine measures are effective and patients can be isolated for 14 days, the outbreak should end.

"I watched the news everyday from my quarantine room and send my support to Wuhan," said the 50-year-old driver, who wore a surgical mask to conceal his identity at a news conference. "Even I can beat it. So can you," the driver said as he was discharged from hospital. The driver checked himself into hospital after coughing heavily. He was identified as Thailand's first case of human-to-human transmission on Jan 31. With 25 cases Thailand has had more virus infections than any other country except China. Nine people have recovered and 16 patients are being treated. The virus has killed nearly 500 people, nearly all of them in China.   "When I found out I had the virus, I cried because I have to take care of my family," the driver said. "But I don't have a bad feeling against tourists or the Chinese. I drive a taxi, tourists are my breadbasket." Thailand received some 11 million tourists from China last year. Doctors praised the driver for stopping work and reporting himself as soon as he fell ill. His family have all tested negative for the virus.

- Date: 08 Feb 2020 11:08AM 08 Feb 2020 11:17AM- Title: Three more coronavirus cases found on Japan cruise ship; total now 64- cases: meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners TOKYO: Three more people on a cruise ship off Japan have tested positive for the new coronavirus, bringing the number aboard to 64, the government said on Saturday (Feb 8), with passengers facing a two-week quarantine. The latest confirmation came a day after an additional 41 passengers were found to have contracted the virus, which has killed hundreds of people, most of them in China, where it has infected more than 30,000 on the mainland. Japanese authorities have so far tested about 280 people on board the Diamond Princess, which was quarantined after a former passenger, who disembarked in Hong Kong last month, was diagnosed with the virus. Test results from six more people were released on Saturday, with three of them confirmed infected, the health ministry said without giving further details such as their nationalities. The three people have already been sent to hospital, the ministry said in a statement. There were more than 3,700 passengers and crew on the ship when it arrived off Japan's coast on Monday evening. It docked in Yokohama on Thursday to resupply for a quarantine that could last until Feb 19. One of those found infected is in serious condition. Many on board are elderly and at greater risk of developing complications from the virus. Testing was initially carried out on those who displayed symptoms or had come into close contact with the former passenger diagnosed.   "VERY, VERY SCARY" Japan has already reported at least 25 cases of coronavirus aside from the infections on board the ship, and evacuated hundreds of citizens from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the pathogen emerged, including on a fourth flight on Friday. Passengers on the ship have been asked to stay inside their cabins to prevent new infections and have expressed confusion and frustration. The World Health Organization (WHO) called on Tokyo to provide sufficient support, including mental care, for the passengers and patients. "There's a lot to do to support those patients. Not just from the point of view of their physical health but from a mental health perspective," Michael Ryan, head of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, told reporters in Geneva on Friday. "It's quite scary, very, very scary to be in that situation," he said. "It's a very stressful situation for those individuals." But he also called for calm, saying: "Let's be careful here not to overreact. This is a very close community living in very close quarters."

- Date: 01 Feb 2020 08:47PM 03 Feb 2020 09:33AM- Title: Singapore confident that China, other countries will work together to win battle against Wuhan coronavirus: PM Lee- cases: meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore has confidence that China and other countries will work together to win the battle against the Wuhan coronavirus, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Saturday (Feb 1). Speaking at a Chinese New Year Celebration in Teck Ghee, Mr Lee said that everyone is concerned about the coronavirus as some may recall when the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) hit Singapore in 2003. “We did not know how long it would last, and we worried about our loved ones being infected. But we stayed united and dealt with the crisis together." Since then, Mr Lee said that Singapore has become better prepared with medical facilities like the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and healthcare professionals who are trained to deal with this scenario. “So I have every confidence that we can overcome the challenge before us,” he said. Referring to Singapore’s decision to restrict entry to new visitors of any nationality with recent travel history to mainland China, Mr Lee said it was a pre-emptive measure taken purely to protect Singapore’s public health.  He added that China is doing all it can to contain the coronavirus spread, including imposing their own travel restrictions within China, cancelling outbound tour groups and bringing back Hubei residents from overseas. “It is a much stronger response than they took when SARS first broke out, so our efforts ... will complement China’s efforts," he said. "We wish China well in their efforts to fight the virus,” Mr Lee added. Regrettably, sentiment against those from the People’s Republic of China has emerged in the last few days in many countries, said Mr Lee, adding that such sentiments are “not helpful at all”.  “The virus may have started in China but it doesn’t respect nationality or race. It doesn't check your passport before it goes into your body and anybody can be infected." Mr Lee stressed that the coronavirus situation should be seen as a public health issue and not as a race or international diplomatic problem. Mr Lee noted that while the situation with the new coronavirus bears some similarities to SARS, it also is somewhat different. The new virus seems to be less lethal than SARS but is also more infectious. Patient may also be asymptomatic when they are infectious, which makes detection difficult. Hence, Mr Lee said that Singapore has to work harder to isolate suspect cases as soon as they are identified, and contain the virus from spreading in the community.  Another difference from SARS is that Singapore did not have social media back then. In a crisis, Mr Lee said social media has been both a boon and a bane as there is now a lot more information circulating online, on WhatsApp and on Facebook, including misleading rumours and false information. Mr Lee said some of these go viral because people are anxious and want to share information without verifying it. Such rumours can easily amplify anxieties and make it harder for people to get the correct information they need, and can even spark fear and panic, he added. “So I strongly advise everybody, if you hear something shocking ... check with proper channels, check from trusted places.” Members of the public can also subscribe to the Government WhatsApp channel to get the latest updates. Mr Lee said everyone can also play their part to be responsible for their own and their families’ safety by practising good personal hygiene and washing their hands frequently.  Those who have a fever, or show symptoms of a cold, should put on a mask and see the doctor. “We know that some of you are worried as you could not buy your own masks." For those who need them, Mr Lee said each household can collect a pack of four masks from their neighbourhood RCs, in stages starting from Saturday. Mr Lee ended his speech by calling on Singapore to remain resilient and calm, respond to the situation as one united nation, and “show care and concern for our fellow human beings”. He added that everyone should continue with their lives as much as possible and that he has confidence Singapore will get through this situation together as it is well-prepared and has dealt with worse situations before.

- Date: 24 Jan 2020 03:08PM 08 Feb 2020 10:28AM- Title: Two more people test positive for Wuhan virus in Singapore; total of 3 confirmed cases: MOH- cases: meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Two more people have tested positive for the Wuhan virus in Singapore, bringing the total number of cases to three, the Ministry of Health announced on Friday (Jan 24). The new patients include the 37-year-old son of the first confirmed case, MOH said in a media briefing on Friday afternoon. The second new confirmed case is a 53-year-old woman from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore on a Scoot flight TR121 at 5.30am on Jan 21. She was flagged by the ministry on Thursday as a preliminary positive case. MOH said that the woman had reported that she was asymptomatic during the flight to Singapore, but developed a fever, cough and chills in the afternoon of her arrival on Jan 21. She sought medical attention at Raffles Hospital the next day and was later taken to the emergency department at Tan Tock Seng Hospital and immediately isolated. MOH was notified of a suspect case at 3am on Jan 23. The woman subsequently tested positive for the virus at midnight. She is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases and is in a stable condition. The woman had stayed at J8 Hotel and visited Orchard Road, Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay, MOH said.   She had also used public transport in Singapore, including the MRT and taxies. "The risk of transient contact, such as on public transport or in public places, is assessed to be low," said MOH.   Singapore's land transport operators said they have implemented preventive measures against the Wuhan virus threat. They include a stepped-up cleaning and disinfecting schedule and issuing travel and personal hygiene advisories to employees.   Both ComfortDelGro and SMRT employees have been advised to avoid all travel to Hubei province, where Wuhan is located. SMRT also said that those returning from China will undergo mandatory temperature taking. "As a precautionary measure for our commuters, hand sanitisers are available at all MRT stations and bus interchanges," added SMRT.  FIRST IMPORTED CASE The latest update comes after Singapore announced on Thursday its first confirmed case, a 66-year-old Wuhan resident who arrived in Singapore from Guangzhou on Jan 20. He is in isolation at the Singapore General Hospital and in a stable condition, authorities said. The man stayed at Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa and indicated that he had kept within the hotel vicinity. Contact tracing for his close contacts is ongoing, said MOH, adding that it has identified 46 such people as of noon on Jan 23. One of them is his 37-year-old son, who is now confirmed as having the virus. Twenty-four of those close contacts - including his eight travelling companions - had left Singapore before his case was confirmed. The health authorities in the respective countries of those 24 people have been informed and are following up, said MOH, without providing information on the countries. The ministry has quarantined 16 people and is still trying to get in touch with the remaining five contacts, it said. "The health status of all close contacts will be closely monitored. As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient," said MOH. "In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status," it added. UPDATE ON SUSPECT CASES There have been a total of 44 suspect cases in Singapore as of noon on Jan 24, of which 13 have tested negative and test results are pending for the remaining 28, said MOH. The suspect cases are aged between 1 and 78 years old. Two of the 44 suspect cases are employees of Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa, the hotel where the first confirmed case had stayed during his trip in Singapore, said Associate Professor Vernon Lee, director of communicable diseases at MOH. The two employees had no travel history to China, he added. There is still no evidence of community spread as the suspect cases were identified early, said Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, director of medical services (designate) at MOH. THE FIGHT AGAINST THE VIRUS Singapore has formed a multi-ministerial task force to deal with the situation and expanded border screening to all land and sea checkpoints. A travel advisory has also been expanded for Singaporeans to avoid travelling to Hubei province, where Wuhan city is located. Schools in Singapore have asked parents to declare their travel plans for the Chinese New Year weekend. Meanwhile, Singapore Airlines' budget carrier Scoot has cancelled its daily flight to Wuhan as a precautionary measure. Singapore businesses with a presence in Wuhan have also taken measures. ST Engineering, which has rail projects in Wuhan, has stopped all business commutes there. MOH said on Friday that the government has sufficient stocks of masks in the warehouses and government stockpiles. It is also working with retailers to move available stocks to the retail shops, and stocks will be available progressively from Friday, it added. On Friday, China reported that the number of people infected by the SARS-like virus had exceeded 800, with 25 deaths. The markedly higher numbers were released just hours after the World Health Organization called the outbreak "an emergency in China", but stopped short of declaring the situation a global health emergency. China has effectively quarantined more than 20 million people across Wuhan and some nearby cities in response to the virus, and announced measures to curb its spread nationwide as hundreds of millions of people began travelling across the country this week for the Chinese New Year holiday.  Streets and shopping centres in Wuhan, a major industrial and transport hub, are now eerily quiet after authorities told residents not to leave the city of 11 million, where most of the cases have been identified. The virus, which causes respiratory symptoms similar to a cold or flu, has been linked to a seafood market in Wuhan. That market has since been shut down. The virus has spread to Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing, as well as provinces in northeastern, central and southern China. Across the world, confirmed cases have also been reported in Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.

- Date: 01 Feb 2020 07:55PM 01 Feb 2020 11:44PM- Title: Avoid speculating, spreading 'unfounded rumours' on Wuhan coronavirus: NEA- cases: meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The National Environment Agency (NEA) on Saturday (Feb 1) advised members of the public to not speculate or spread "unfounded rumours" regarding the Wuhan coronavirus. Referring to a circulating text message that contains a list of "places to avoid" in Singapore, NEA said that there is no need for members of the public to avoid these locations. The text message that is currently being shared on messaging platforms such as WhatsApp and Telegram includes the names of hotels, hospitals and shopping centres that have been purportedly exposed to confirmed cases in Singapore. “We would like to assure the public that NEA officers have been liaising closely with, and providing support to, residents and owners of premises, to ensure that the cleaning and disinfection of areas are done in accordance with our guidelines. "We have also issued sanitation and hygiene advisories to premises and facilities with high public access like hotels and F&B outlets, including hawker centres," NEA said.  Singapore has reported 18 cases of the infection as of Saturday. Many of the confirmed cases are visitors to Singapore and have been to locations such as Orchard Road, Gardens by the Bay and Sentosa. Acting clinical director for the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Dr Shawn Vasoo told CNA that rumours claiming members of the public can get the coronavirus infection from walking through certain places is “categorically untrue”.  “You don't get infection typically from places, but from infected persons. So I would say that the messages that have been going out on WhatsApp and other social media … we should not be spreading them because it causes an unnecessary degree of paranoia and worry amongst people. “You only get infected by, typically, by an infected person and you have to be in quite close contact with the person,” he said. Dr Vasoo also said that “close contact” typically refers to people who are living in the same household, those who are caring for someone who might be infected, or those who are the same space for a prolonged period of time. Transient contact – for example, walking past someone in a public space – is not considered close contact and the likelihood for infection for that is probably minuscule, he added.

Referring to a circulating text message that contains a list of "places to avoid" in Singapore, NEA said that there is no need for members of the public to avoid these locations. The text message that is currently being shared on messaging platforms such as WhatsApp and Telegram includes the names of hotels, hospitals and shopping centres that have been purportedly exposed to confirmed cases in Singapore. “We would like to assure the public that NEA officers have been liaising closely with, and providing support to, residents and owners of premises, to ensure that the cleaning and disinfection of areas are done in accordance with our guidelines. "We have also issued sanitation and hygiene advisories to premises and facilities with high public access like hotels and F&B outlets, including hawker centres," NEA said.  Singapore has reported 18 cases of the infection as of Saturday. Many of the confirmed cases are visitors to Singapore and have been to locations such as Orchard Road, Gardens by the Bay and Sentosa.

- Date: 03 Feb 2020 11:31AM 03 Feb 2020 01:51PM- Title: Chinese markets plunge US$420 billion as novel coronavirus death toll rises- cases: meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: The death toll from a coronavirus epidemic in China rose to 361 and Chinese stock and commodity markets fell heavily on Monday (Feb 3) as investors retreated into safe-haven assets in the first trading session after an extended Chinese New Year break. Chinese stock and commodity markets wiped US$420 billion off China's stock market in their first session since Jan 23, when the outbreak of the newly identified virus had claimed only 17 lives in Wuhan city in Hubei province. By lunchtime, the benchmark Shanghai Composite index sat 8 per cent lower near an almost one-year trough, and was poised to post its worst day in more than four years. The yuan opened at its weakest level in 2020 and slid almost 1.2 per cent, past the symbolic 7-per-dollar level, as the falls soured the mood in markets throughout Asia. Shanghai-traded oil, iron ore, copper and soft commodities contracts all posted sharp drops, catching up with sliding global prices.   Investors were bracing for volatility when onshore trade in Chinese stocks, bonds, yuan and commodities resumed, following a steep global selldown on fears about the impact of the virus on the world's second-biggest economy. "This will last for some time," said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING. "It's uncertain whether factory workers, or how many of them, will return to their factories," she said. "We haven't yet seen corporate earnings since the (spread of the) coronavirus. Restaurants and retailers may have very little sales." More than 2,500 stocks fell by the daily limit of 10 per cent. The Shanghai Composite last sat at 2,734.7 and the onshore yuan at 7.0165 per dollar. Copper sank to its lowest in more than three years, falling by its daily limit of 7 per cent, while aluminium, zinc and lead shed more than 4 per cent and soybeans dropped 2 per cent. Bond prices, meanwhile, surged, with March futures contracts for 10-year bonds jumping 1.5 per cent. CLEAR MESSAGE Amid the selldown, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) injected 1.2 trillion yuan (US$173.81 billion) into money markets through reverse bond repurchase agreements. It also unexpectedly cut the interest rate on those short-term funding facilities by 10 basis points. China's securities regulator moved to limit short selling and urged mutual fund managers not to sell shares unless they face investor redemptions, sources told Reuters. "It is a clear message that they want to take growth-supportive measures and keep the market reassured," said Mayank Mishra, macro strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore of the PBOC move. "They are managing the situation well. The timing of the repo rate cut came a little quicker than some people were expecting, but they wanted to send a clear message." Beijing has also said it would help firms that produce vital goods resume work as soon as possible, state broadcaster CCTV reported. Cities like Wuhan, where the virus originated, remain in virtual lockdown and China is facing mounting international isolation. Analysts are beginning to suspect the impact will be deeper than the hit delivered by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. "Although most analysts agree it is too early to estimate the impact of (the virus) on the global economy, one thing I am increasingly more certain of is that the near-term shock to Chinese economy will be much higher than that in SARS period," said Tommy Xie, head of Greater China research at OCBC. "The shock to Chinese manufacturing and industry sectors is likely to be unprecedented."   Since then the flu-like virus has spread to more than two dozen other countries and regions, with the first death outside of China reported on Sunday, that of a 44-year-old Chinese man who died in the Philippines after travelling from Wuhan. The total number of deaths in China rose to 361 as of Sunday, up 57 from the previous day, the National Health Commission said. The number of new confirmed infections in China rose by 2,829, bringing the total to 17,205. While stock markets reopened, most provinces have extended the Chinese New Year holiday to try and contain the virus, with workers in Hubei not scheduled to return to work until after Feb 13.   At least another 171 cases have been reported in more than two dozen other countries and regions, including the United States, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong and Britain. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, but said global trade and travel restrictions are not needed. More than 250 people from 30 countries arrived in France on Sunday after being flown out of Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, in the latest evacuation of foreign nationals from the locked-down city. Australia evacuated 243 people, many children, from Wuhan on Monday and will quarantine them on a remote island in the Indian Ocean off its northwest coast.   Australia on Saturday followed the United States in barring entry to all foreign nationals travelling from mainland China. The Group of Seven leading industrialised democracies are trying to find a common approach for dealing with the fast-spreading new coronavirus, German Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Sunday. The virus is thought to have emerged late last year in a Wuhan market illegally trading wildlife. It can cause pneumonia and spreads between people in droplets from coughs and sneezes.   It has created alarm because it is spreading quickly and there are still important unknowns surrounding it, such as its death rate and whether it is able to spread before any symptoms show. The number of deaths in China from the new virus has now passed the total Chinese toll from the 2002-03 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus which emerged from China and killed more than 800 people around the world. Even so, Chinese data on the numbers of infections and deaths suggests the new coronavirus is less deadly than the SARS outbreak, although such numbers can evolve rapidly.

- Date: 08 Feb 2020 06:00AM 08 Feb 2020 06:10AM- Title: Commentary: Amid gloomy outlook, Hong Kong wrestles with novel coronavirus. But it’s surprisingly resilient- cases: meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners The Hong Kong economy has weathered two recent economic crisis over recent decades. But the novel coronavirus and continuing protests pose a different challenge, says Mohammed Abdul Shihab. DUBAI: As protests in Hong Kong continue into the New Year, the city is grappling with a new challenge: A slowing Asian economy made worse by the novel coronavirus outbreak. The coronavirus shows no signs of slowing, having infected more than 30,000 people and claiming hundreds of lives in mainland China. Hong Kong has reported more than 20 cases and at least one death. At least four of the reported cases were transmitted locally, leading some to say that the city is on the brink of a community outbreak comparable to SARS. Meanwhile, the World Bank says the continent will have to contend with weakening global demand – a challenge exacerbated by the largely unresolved trade war between Washington and Beijing despite a Phase 1 deal. Growth in East Asia is projected to ease to 5.7 per cent in 2020, reflecting also a moderate slowdown in China and external headwinds. But these projections may be downgraded again in light of the worsening effects of the novel coronavirus on the Chinese, and thus the Asian, economy. Markets were stable early last week on the back of estimates that this new virus would have little economic impact given the 2003 SARS outbreak did little damage. Last Thursday, however, global markets dove after news of an uptick in new infections, and, that the lockdown imposed in China has effectively shut down vast swathes of its working population. The selloff continued in China on Monday as stocks there dropped 8 per cent. THE LIGHTHOUSE IN STORMY WATERS During past slowdowns, Hong Kong was seen as the lighthouse in stormy waters – an economic powerhouse and political haven that could withstand both regional and global pressures. Carefully cultivated fiscal policies have made the city an indispensable base for multinational banks and corporations. Hong Kong has also maintained the top spot on the 2019 Index of Economic Freedom, which noted that the territory is “an exceptionally competitive financial and business hub that remains one of the world’s most resilient economies".   Heading into the new decade, however, the reality is more nuanced. Continuing protests have shaken confidence in the city’s financial hub, stymied tourism, and hurt its retail sector. Compounded with reverberations from the trade war, Hong Kong’s economy contracted 2.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2019, marking the third consecutive contraction in the city state’s first recession in a decade. This downturn is conservatively forecast to end in the latter half of 2020, with the International Monetary Fund predicting overall GDP growth of about 1.5 per cent for the year. Interestingly, these predictions already take into account disruptions arising from the months-long protests, meaning an easing of these disturbances could ease economic stress in 2020. That, in addition to the tough lessons learned from financial crises in the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 2008 global crisis, could make Hong Kong one of the region’s best economic performers this year. HONG KONG HAS SURVIVED PAST CRISES In 1997, Asia was hit by an economic crisis when currencies across the east of the continent – starting with Thailand – began to fall precipitously, triggering bailouts in some cases by the International Monetary Fund. As a sell-off intensified, Hong Kong took advantage of its vast foreign exchange reserves to swiftly protect the peg that linked its currency’s value to that of the US dollar. At the time, economists described this peg as “the indicator of political confidence,” and predicted a loss would have fuel capital flight, tumbling property prices and collapsing banks. Having the foresight to build such large foreign reserves and the insight to harness them led to a strong defence of the currency against a speculative attack.   Hong Kong officials also reacted swiftly to shore up targeted companies after speculators turned their eye to the stock market. In all, Hong’s Kong’s stock market remained the best performing market in the region during the crisis, despite the Hang Seng falling by 60 per cent that year and property prices slumping. Although the contributing factors to the 2008 global recession were different, catalysed by the US subprime mortgage crisis, lessons learned from the downturn 10 years earlier helped the territory stay on its feet and turned the economy around in the same year. Donald Tong, Hong Kong Commissioner for Economic and Trade Affairs, said the city defied the downturn because of improvements in risk management, a more transparent regulatory environment, a continued focus on financial innovation, and sound fundamentals including “prudent fiscal policies and healthy fiscal reserves”. Measures were enacted to boost public confidence, including a government guarantee on all bank deposits without a ceiling, a prioritising of public infrastructure projects, and a multibillion-dollar plan to unfreeze credit for businesses. Singing praises for the Hong Kong Treasury’s actions, Janet Yellen, who went on to chair the US Federal Reserve, noted Hong Kong was recovering “impressively” from the global recession - more so than the United States. A NEW ERA? The city’s resilience, underpinned by an elastic and dynamic monetary policy, should instill a sense of confidence that it is well-positioned to handle global economic uncertainties in 2020. Yet this time around, Hong Kong will fight a slightly different battle: A battle against the novel coronavirus outbreak. Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced the closure of all but two land border crossings to China, as well as a mandatory two-week quarantine for all travellers arriving from mainland China this week.   But criticism has grown over the government’s perceived slow response to the outbreak, amid calls for Hong Kong to fully close the border with the mainland. Hundreds of medical workers went on strike starting from Feb 3, demanding the government seal off the border to stop the spread of the virus and ease pressure on strained health facilities. An escalation of the outbreak, not just in Hong Kong but also in China, would add significant stress already imposed by the city’s divisive protest groups. The protests alone were responsible for visitor numbers falling by almost 40 per cent in the second half of 2019, fuelled by uncertainty in public safety. Trips from mainland China have taken a nosedive, and in October, were down more than 45 per cent compared with the same period last year. The unrest has also hurt retail. Last November, sales were lower than the year before, with small businesses feeling under strain, unemployment rising, and footfall declining because of how many recent demonstrations had taken place in shopping districts. On the other hand, Alibaba’s blockbuster secondary listing in Hong Kong in November last year, the biggest IPO in 2019, eased fears of a recession and was seen by many as a vote of confidence in the city. THE WORLD’S FREEST ECONOMY During the crisis of 1998, Joseph Yam, the then Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority affirmed: We are committed to maintaining our position as the world's freest economy. Hong Kong has built its reputation on free market principles. Indeed, for Hong Kong to stay true to form as financially resilient, protest groups and the government will need to begin tough negotiations on how to revive the city’s civility.   Already, outbreak fears risk becoming a new flashpoint in the city’s unrest. The Hong Kong government had to halt work on turning a housing estate as a possible quarantine facility after violent protests erupted on Monday (Jan 27) as protesters hurled a molotov cocktail at the site. No doubt, any new negotiations will focus on a cohesive political agreement, and one that reaffirms the “one-country, two-systems” principle that has allowed Hong Kong to embrace the West and China so successfully. But now that challenge is compounded by a deadly virus outbreak – a threat Lam’s administration must respond to decisively to avoid opening up another front for violent protests.

But it’s surprisingly resilient- cases: meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners The Hong Kong economy has weathered two recent economic crisis over recent decades. But the novel coronavirus and continuing protests pose a different challenge, says Mohammed Abdul Shihab. DUBAI: As protests in Hong Kong continue into the New Year, the city is grappling with a new challenge: A slowing Asian economy made worse by the novel coronavirus outbreak. The coronavirus shows no signs of slowing, having infected more than 30,000 people and claiming hundreds of lives in mainland China. Hong Kong has reported more than 20 cases and at least one death. At least four of the reported cases were transmitted locally, leading some to say that the city is on the brink of a community outbreak comparable to SARS. Meanwhile, the World Bank says the continent will have to contend with weakening global demand – a challenge exacerbated by the largely unresolved trade war between Washington and Beijing despite a Phase 1 deal. Growth in East Asia is projected to ease to 5.7 per cent in 2020, reflecting also a moderate slowdown in China and external headwinds. But these projections may be downgraded again in light of the worsening effects of the novel coronavirus on the Chinese, and thus the Asian, economy. Markets were stable early last week on the back of estimates that this new virus would have little economic impact given the 2003 SARS outbreak did little damage. Last Thursday, however, global markets dove after news of an uptick in new infections, and, that the lockdown imposed in China has effectively shut down vast swathes of its working population. The selloff continued in China on Monday as stocks there dropped 8 per cent. THE LIGHTHOUSE IN STORMY WATERS During past slowdowns, Hong Kong was seen as the lighthouse in stormy waters – an economic powerhouse and political haven that could withstand both regional and global pressures. Carefully cultivated fiscal policies have made the city an indispensable base for multinational banks and corporations. Hong Kong has also maintained the top spot on the 2019 Index of Economic Freedom, which noted that the territory is “an exceptionally competitive financial and business hub that remains one of the world’s most resilient economies".   Heading into the new decade, however, the reality is more nuanced. Continuing protests have shaken confidence in the city’s financial hub, stymied tourism, and hurt its retail sector. Compounded with reverberations from the trade war, Hong Kong’s economy contracted 2.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2019, marking the third consecutive contraction in the city state’s first recession in a decade. This downturn is conservatively forecast to end in the latter half of 2020, with the International Monetary Fund predicting overall GDP growth of about 1.5 per cent for the year. Interestingly, these predictions already take into account disruptions arising from the months-long protests, meaning an easing of these disturbances could ease economic stress in 2020. That, in addition to the tough lessons learned from financial crises in the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 2008 global crisis, could make Hong Kong one of the region’s best economic performers this year. HONG KONG HAS SURVIVED PAST CRISES In 1997, Asia was hit by an economic crisis when currencies across the east of the continent – starting with Thailand – began to fall precipitously, triggering bailouts in some cases by the International Monetary Fund. As a sell-off intensified, Hong Kong took advantage of its vast foreign exchange reserves to swiftly protect the peg that linked its currency’s value to that of the US dollar. At the time, economists described this peg as “the indicator of political confidence,” and predicted a loss would have fuel capital flight, tumbling property prices and collapsing banks. Having the foresight to build such large foreign reserves and the insight to harness them led to a strong defence of the currency against a speculative attack.   Hong Kong officials also reacted swiftly to shore up targeted companies after speculators turned their eye to the stock market. In all, Hong’s Kong’s stock market remained the best performing market in the region during the crisis, despite the Hang Seng falling by 60 per cent that year and property prices slumping. Although the contributing factors to the 2008 global recession were different, catalysed by the US subprime mortgage crisis, lessons learned from the downturn 10 years earlier helped the territory stay on its feet and turned the economy around in the same year. Donald Tong, Hong Kong Commissioner for Economic and Trade Affairs, said the city defied the downturn because of improvements in risk management, a more transparent regulatory environment, a continued focus on financial innovation, and sound fundamentals including “prudent fiscal policies and healthy fiscal reserves”. Measures were enacted to boost public confidence, including a government guarantee on all bank deposits without a ceiling, a prioritising of public infrastructure projects, and a multibillion-dollar plan to unfreeze credit for businesses. Singing praises for the Hong Kong Treasury’s actions, Janet Yellen, who went on to chair the US Federal Reserve, noted Hong Kong was recovering “impressively” from the global recession - more so than the United States. A NEW ERA? The city’s resilience, underpinned by an elastic and dynamic monetary policy, should instill a sense of confidence that it is well-positioned to handle global economic uncertainties in 2020. Yet this time around, Hong Kong will fight a slightly different battle: A battle against the novel coronavirus outbreak. Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced the closure of all but two land border crossings to China, as well as a mandatory two-week quarantine for all travellers arriving from mainland China this week.   But criticism has grown over the government’s perceived slow response to the outbreak, amid calls for Hong Kong to fully close the border with the mainland. Hundreds of medical workers went on strike starting from Feb 3, demanding the government seal off the border to stop the spread of the virus and ease pressure on strained health facilities. An escalation of the outbreak, not just in Hong Kong but also in China, would add significant stress already imposed by the city’s divisive protest groups. The protests alone were responsible for visitor numbers falling by almost 40 per cent in the second half of 2019, fuelled by uncertainty in public safety. Trips from mainland China have taken a nosedive, and in October, were down more than 45 per cent compared with the same period last year. The unrest has also hurt retail. Last November, sales were lower than the year before, with small businesses feeling under strain, unemployment rising, and footfall declining because of how many recent demonstrations had taken place in shopping districts. On the other hand, Alibaba’s blockbuster secondary listing in Hong Kong in November last year, the biggest IPO in 2019, eased fears of a recession and was seen by many as a vote of confidence in the city. THE WORLD’S FREEST ECONOMY During the crisis of 1998, Joseph Yam, the then Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority affirmed: We are committed to maintaining our position as the world's freest economy. Hong Kong has built its reputation on free market principles. Indeed, for Hong Kong to stay true to form as financially resilient, protest groups and the government will need to begin tough negotiations on how to revive the city’s civility.   Already, outbreak fears risk becoming a new flashpoint in the city’s unrest. The Hong Kong government had to halt work on turning a housing estate as a possible quarantine facility after violent protests erupted on Monday (Jan 27) as protesters hurled a molotov cocktail at the site. No doubt, any new negotiations will focus on a cohesive political agreement, and one that reaffirms the “one-country, two-systems” principle that has allowed Hong Kong to embrace the West and China so successfully. But now that challenge is compounded by a deadly virus outbreak – a threat Lam’s administration must respond to decisively to avoid opening up another front for violent protests. The city’s political and economic future depend on it. Mohammed Abdul Shihab is Managing Director of Al-Sharq Advisory. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

"Following the Singapore Ministry of Health's Feb 7 declaration of a Code Orange health alert, we consulted with the US government and our medical teams and decided not to participate in the Singapore Airshow," the company said in a statement. "We determined this was in the best interest of our employees and aligned with the US Department of Defense's decision to reduce its presence," it said. Earlier on Friday, people familiar with the matter said the Pentagon will reduce the size of its delegation travelling to the airshow. Ellen Lord, the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer, will no longer attend the event as the lead Pentagon representative, the people said. Other Pentagon leaders including uniformed military officials still plan to attend. The airshow will continue next week, but organisers might look to limit public visitors, Singapore said on Friday, as the country reported three more coronavirus cases that authorities have not yet linked to previous infections or travel to China. The new cases take Singapore's virus tally to 33 with the alert level raised to Orange, denoting the disease is severe and passes easily from person-to-person. Red - the highest alert level - indicates it is spreading widely. The trade portion of the airshow, held every two years, is set to begin on Feb 11. Two other aviation manufacturers, DeHavilland Canada and Viking Air, on Friday also pulled out of the airshow, citing the increased alert level. Their parent company Longview Aviation said the decision was made "out of an abundance of caution for the well-being of our employees". Business jet manufacturers Bombardier, Textronand General Dynamics's Gulfstream division are among other companies that have withdrawn from the airshow.

None of the 18 previously announced cases is critically ill. All of them remain in stable condition, and most are improving, the ministry said. As of noon on Sunday, 240 suspect cases have tested negative for 2019-nCoV, while test results for another 43 cases are pending. MOH also gave more details on an 18th confirmed case which was announced on Saturday. The 18th case, a 31 year-old Chinese woman who arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 22, reported that she was asymptomatic during her flight to Singapore. She was a travelling companion of the 12th confirmed case and was identified as a close contact on Jan 30. She reported that she had not left her room at Home Suite View Hotel in Geylang until she was transferred to a government quarantine facility in the early hours of Jan 31. While at the facility, she reported that she has had a cough since the day before. She was taken by an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), where she was immediately isolated. Tests confirmed her 2019-nCoV infection on Saturday afternoon. She is currently warded at NCID. MOH has identified 251 close contacts of the 18 cases. Of the 182 who are still in Singapore, 179 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining three close contacts, the ministry said. Singapore on Friday announced that it will widen travel restrictions to include all new visitors with recent travel history to China. The expanded measures started at 11.59pm on Saturday. As of 1pm on Sunday, the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) has refused entry to 15 travellers into Singapore, due to either their travel histories to mainland China in the last 14 days, or suspension of visa facilities. They are of six nationalities - one Spanish, one British, one Malaysian, two US, five PRC and five Indian passport holders, ICA said. On Saturday, authorities began distributing packs of four surgical masks for each Singapore household. There have been long queues for masks at pharmacies and retailers across the country.  Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing on Sunday also said that the impact of the Wuhan coronavirus situation could be "wider, deeper and longer" than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. The Singapore Tourism Board has announced measures to help the tourism sector, including waiving licence fees for hotels, travel agents and tour guides.

- Date: 07 Feb 2020 06:05PM 07 Feb 2020 07:44PM- Title: Chinese aerobatics team took ‘stringent’ health tests, also concerned about coronavirus in Singapore: Ng Eng Hen- cases: meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The Chinese aerobatics team underwent “stringent” health checks to ensure they met Singapore’s criteria before being cleared to perform at the upcoming Singapore Airshow, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen on Friday (Feb 7). The People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) Ba Yi team is also “just as concerned” about the coronavirus outbreak in Singapore, Dr Ng told reporters on the sidelines of a visit to the Changi Airbase where he met some participants of the aerobatics display. “The PLAAF had taken extra precautions for every member of their delegation that meet our criteria to make sure that they are healthy, well and they’ve passed all health checks,” he said. The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) had revealed on Thursday that the Ba Yi team will go for regular health and temperature monitoring during its stay in Singapore. This comes after the public expressed concerns about their participation in the airshow, given Singapore’s travel restrictions on visitors from China. “I think it’s natural to be concerned, and they are just as concerned as us because we have cases here,” Dr Ng said. “In fact just like other pandemics, whether it’s SARS or H1N1, once it goes to the community you can get it from anywhere. “But we had been very careful, and the PLAAF has been particularly careful that they observe all requirements that were needed to be healthy, and they underwent stringent tests so I’m very thankful for that.”   Dr Ng said MINDEF stands by the health and travel measures recommended by the multi-ministry task force and public health experts tackling the outbreak. Likewise the PLAAF, as with the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), is “concerned about the virus spreading within their own ranks”, he continued. “Like the SAF, they are making preparations to make sure that if there’s an outbreak, we can either prevent or limit the extent of the outbreak even within our military troops,” he explained. “Because if you have a situation where your military troops are sick, you have an issue about national defence, so they have taken the necessary precautions and health checks and I was happy to meet them.” Dr Ng said the Ba Yi team has brought with them “military discipline” when in Singapore, highlighting that their presence here is supported by Chinese defence minister General Wei Fenghe.   He said he had extended an invitation last year to the “famous” Ba Yi team to perform at this year’s airshow to commemorate 30 years of diplomatic ties with China. This was when he met Gen Wei last October to sign the Enhanced Agreement on Defence Exchanges and Security Cooperation with China. “So, I’m very happy that they are here and that they put in so much effort,” Dr Ng said, adding that the airshow will proceed “for the time being”. “Again, it’s a measure of how strong our relationship is. You know this phrase: Good friends stick through thick and thin.”   Nevertheless, Dr Ng said everyone is aware that many countries including Singapore are “grappling” with the outbreak. “As in previous outbreaks, whether it’s an epidemic or even a pandemic, there’s a life cycle to the viral attack,” he added. “We must be prepared for ups and downs, but at the same time, make sure that Singapore keeps going.”   During the visit, Dr Ng met and chatted with aircrew from the Republic of Singapore Air Force, the United States Marine Corps, the United States Pacific Air Forces and the Ba Yi team. Fighter aircraft from the two foreign forces will perform in the aerobatics segment of the airshow for the first time.   In particular, the US' fifth-generation F-35B, which Singapore was recently cleared to buy, will take to the skies together with its equally stealthy F-22. The F-35B can also land vertically and take-off from shorter runways. "It's a phenomenal aircraft," F-35 pilot Lieutenant Colonel Michael Rountree, 41, said. "Its capabilities are unique, it's absolutely game-changing. it's extremely flexible." Lt Col Rountree said it was "very significant" that Singaporeans will be able to see its future jet perform in Singapore's airspace for the first time. "We are very happy to be here to show these capabilities to you and hopefully strengthen our relationship with Singapore," he added.   After speaking to US, Dr Ng boarded a bus to where the Ba Yi team was assembled alongside its distinctive blue-and-red J-10 jets. Dr Ng clasped his palms and wished them a happy new year in Mandarin, before a crew member pulled over a staircase so he could climb into one of the jets.   The minister, who had taken a group photo with the entire crew, spent a few minutes in the cockpit. He thanked the team for being here, after which the meeting ended in warm smiles, claps and handshakes. “I told them to focus on the show,” he said. “It’s a high-end manoeuvre, high speed, (so I told them) to be strong, focused and I think they’ll put up a good show.”  It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

The round-the-clock packing operation at the SAFTI Military Institute started on Thursday (Jan 30) evening after the multi-ministerial task force announced that each Singapore household will receive a pack of four masks. The SAF will use large vans and operational utility vehicles to deliver the masks to 89 Residents' Committee centres and Community Centres, after which the People's Association (PA) will distribute them to the public.  The SAF personnel are working eight-hour shifts, with each shift expected to pack 200,000 masks. They will aim to deliver the first batch of masks on Friday evening and finish the operation by Saturday evening.   Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said the SAF is “very aware” that all agencies in Singapore have to “lean forward” to do its part in tackling the Wuhan coronavirus. “Every new biological outbreak can be very serious if we are not quick enough to take up the right measures,” he told reporters at the packing area on Friday. This comes as Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said on Thursday that there is a sufficient supply of masks in Singapore if managed properly, amid concerns over a lack of availability at retailers islandwide. Many people in Singapore are donning surgical masks as a form of protection against the coronavirus, although experts have cautioned it could create a "false sense of security" if not used properly. FACTORY LINE On Friday, 450 servicemen wearing gloves, masks and hair nets sat at rows of tables in a large hall – chosen for its sterile environment and proximity to a transport line. Servicemen who leave the hall have to sanitise their hands before returning to the tables. They removed masks from a small box and placed four of them in a Ziploc bag. These then go into a larger carton that can contain 400 of such bags. Each van can carry up to 14,000 bags.   Other servicemen help to pack the large cartons and move them to vehicles waiting outside. After this 8am shift ends at 4pm, another will take over. The SAF personnel include non-uniformed staff as well as full-time national servicemen and regulars from the Combat Service Support Command. Dr Ng said the servicemen took a few hours after being activated to prepare the entire set-up, including getting materials like masks, ziploc bags and packing boxes from various agencies. Nevertheless, he said the servicemen were “on track” with their progress, adding that they were in good spirits.   “You know that when you do this, you’re doing it to protect your family and fellow Singaporeans, and you’re very proud of it,” he stated. It is not the first time the SAF is conducting such an operation – during the haze crisis in 2013, it packed and distributed more than 1 million masks to the public through the PA. CONTACT TRACING, TEMPERATURE SCREENING The SAF is also helping out in other areas of the battle against the Wuhan coronavirus. Dr Ng said that as part of contact tracing, SAF personnel are making a hundred calls a day to people in Singapore who have travelled to Hubei province recently to ask about their condition. They are also manning thermal imagery equipment at airports and will inform airport staff if they detect symptomatic passengers. The minister stressed that these SAF personnel are not in direct contact with passengers, adding that they were not trained to do so.   Dr Ng had also said in a Facebook post on Thursday that the SAF is using its premises for quarantine cases. On Friday, he said the SAF is “careful” to ensure it maintains operational readiness even as it deploys resources to contain the Wuhan coronavirus. “Even though it’s a national effort, we want to make sure that the SAF keeps its eye on its primary responsibility,” he said. “We will not compromise security, even though this is important, and that is why we mobilised the Combat Service Support Command, whereas other operational units are still on tasking.” When asked if there are SAF servicemen currently in China, Dr Ng said the SAF has instructed personnel to defer non-essential travel to the country, adding that there were also no upcoming bilateral exercises with China. "Even if (the trip to China is) important, they have to get clearance," he added.

"We can confirm that a 60-year-old US citizen diagnosed with coronavirus died at a hospital in Wuhan, China, on Feb 6," an embassy spokesman told AFP on Saturday (Feb 8), without specifying the person's gender. "We offer the sincerest condolences to the family for their loss," the spokesman said, adding that no further comment would be made out of respect for the family's privacy. The Japanese foreign ministry in a statement on Saturday also said that one of its citizens with a suspected coronavirus infection has died in a hospital in the Chinese city. The man in his 60s had been hospitalised due to severe pneumonia and the hospital reported his death to the Japanese embassy in China, the ministry said in a statement. Chinese medical authorities said the man was highly likely to have been infected with the new coronavirus but "it is difficult to make a definitive judgment", the statement said. His cause of death was given as viral pneumonia, it added. These latest cases would be the first confirmed foreign deaths in China from the outbreak. Two people have died from the virus outside the mainland: A man from Wuhan in the Philippines and a 39-year-old man in Hong Kong. At least 722 people have died from the virus in China while more than 34,000 have been infected, according to the latest official figures. The Chinese foreign ministry said on Thursday that 19 foreigners have been infected in China, and two of them have recovered. The ministry refused to disclose their nationalities.

- Date: 07 Feb 2020 06:29PM 07 Feb 2020 11:45PM- Title: Precautionary measures stepped up at Victoria Junior College after teacher tests positive for novel coronavirus- cases: meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Precautionary measures have been stepped up to help minimise the potential spread of the novel coronavirus at Victoria Junior College, after a teacher at the school was one of three newly infected patients in Singapore. The college will thoroughly disinfect the staff room, pantry and the teaching rooms the teacher was in, said Ms Liew Wei Li, director of schools at the Ministry of Education (MOE), at a media briefing on Friday (Feb 7). Co-curricular activities at the college have been suspended for two weeks with immediate effect, and instead of lectures there will be more “tutorial-size” classes, she said.  The 42-year-old Singaporean teacher first reported symptoms on Sunday and was admitted to hospital three days later, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). She had been absent from school for the past week on medical leave due to a high fever, and was last at school on Jan 31, MOE said in a press release. A few colleagues and students were in close contact with her and will be given 14 days’ leave of absence starting from the last day of contact, said Ms Liew. In a Facebook post on Friday night, Education Minister Ong Ye Kung said he spoke with the teacher on the phone, who told him that she "felt bad" over what has happened. "I spoke with the teacher on the phone earlier this evening. She felt bad about what happened, but I assured her it was not her fault. What we are doing are necessary precautions to keep our schools safe. I also wished her speedy recovery," he said. Mr Ong also reminded the public of the enhanced measures that MOE has implemented, which include the suspension of inter-school and external activities. "This is to reduce the mixing of students across schools and exposure to large crowds at public places," he said. "We have also put in place a stringent hygiene regime, ensuring students and staff practise good personal hygiene, and also social hygiene protocols such as wiping down surfaces after use." In the Facebook post, Mr Ong also said that parents asking for classes to be suspended was both "drastic" and "unrealistic". "Some parents have suggested suspending schools. But this is a drastic move that will disrupt life for many families, and it is also not realistic to expect older children to stay home the whole time school is closed." He also assured the public that MOE will continue to monitor the situation and take necessary steps "to keep our people safe".   Singapore on Friday announced three new cases of the novel coronavirus, taking the total number of people confirmed to have the virus in the country to 33. In addition to the teacher, the other two cases are a 53-year-old Singaporean man who had been in Malaysia on Jan 6, 11 and 17 and a 39-year-old Singaporean woman who had also been in Malaysia from Jan 22 to 29. None of the three new patients is linked to the existing cases or have been in China recently, said the health ministry. The Government also raised the risk assessment for the novel coronavirus outbreak from DORSCON Yellow to DORSCON Orange, introducing additional precautionary measures. These include the suspension of inter-school and external activities with immediate effect until the end of the March school holidays. All schools and teachers will also continue to implement previously announced enhanced measures such as classroom-based assemblies.   The novel coronavirus outbreak started in the Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei province, but has since spread to more than 20 countries. More than 600 people have died and at least 30,000 people have been infected with the disease, the vast majority of them in China.

The country was ill-prepared for the outbreak at the time, she said, noting there were not enough isolation rooms and efforts then were based out of the old Communicable Disease Centre compound on Moulmein Road – which has since been replaced by the NCID. The new facility is better placed to handle the Wuhan coronavirus situation, she noted. The NCID, which officially opened in September last year, has more than 330 isolation rooms at its Jalan Tan Tock Seng location. Between November 2002 and July 2003, SARS affected 8,098 people worldwide, resulting in 774 deaths across 17 countries. In Singapore, 238 were infected, resulting in the deaths of 33 people here. For her work in tackling the SARS crisis, Dr Ang received the National Day Award (Medal of Valour) and the Courage Medal. Dr Ang - who also chairs Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s infection control committee – also played a role in controlling the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. Eighteen people died in that outbreak here. THE CURRENT SITUATION The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak a "global emergency". As of Saturday morning, there were more than 11,000 confirmed cases of Wuhan coronavirus worldwide, with 258 reported deaths, all in China. Singapore now has 16 confirmed cases of the virus, including a 47-year-old Singaporean who travelled to Wuhan with her family. In dealing with the virus, Singapore has learned many lessons from dealing with SARS 17 years ago, she said. “Each outbreak is different, but the core principles remain the same.” These include “very strict compliance with infection control measures”, as well as ensuring accurate information gets disseminated to stem rumours and misinformation.  “Part of the reaction to any outbreak response is managing fears on the ground, as well as coming up with relevant recommendations,” she noted. For example, while frontline staff at NCID such as doctors and nurses - as well as others such as security staff who may also have to deal with patients - may need to wear masks, this is not necessary for everyone. “If you’re in finance, you don’t need to wear a mask,” she said. While morale is generally high, she acknowledges that there are concerns among staff who are dealing with the current coronavirus situation. “There are fears, especially for those who didn't go through SARS,” said Dr Ang. “We have a few SARS veterans here. One of the things I said at the first briefings (for the Wuhan coronavirus) was don’t worry, we have been through this before. We can handle it.” “I saw Singapore's first SARS case, I’m still alive and standing,” she said. The work of handling patients cannot be just be left to junior staff, she said, adding senior staff including consultants must also be seen to be doing their part. Senior anesthetists were among the first to volunteer to be on call during the SARS crisis in 2003, she noted. “Seniors cannot just be hiding in their offices, they have to be there.” On how widespread the Wuhan coronavirus is likely to be, Dr Ang said current literature suggests that even people who are exposed to the virus do not necessarily get infected. “It probably isn’t that infectious, (even though) people are wearing surgical masks all over the place.”  Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

Another death was reported in Chongqing, bringing the total number of new deaths in the country to 46. In its daily update, the provincial health commission also said newly confirmed cases of infection in Hubei continued to grow at a steady pace, with 1,347. Nationwide there were 2,102 new cases as of Jan 31. That puts the national total at 11,791 as of Jan 31, according to the National Health Commission. Most of the country's deaths and overall cases have been in Hubei, a populous province in China's centre. The top Communist Party official in Wuhan, the central city of 11 million people where the virus first emerged in December, on Friday expressed "remorse" because local authorities acted too slowly. The virus is believed to have emerged in December in the provincial capital of Wuhan in a meat market that sold wild game. Last week, China's central government finally jumped into action, effectively sealing off Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province, and curbing travel across the nation of 1.4 billion people. But the epidemic has spread far and wide as Chinese people travelled across the country and abroad over the Chinese New Year holiday that started last week. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a global health emergency, but said it was not recommending any international trade or travel restrictions. It has since ballooned into a global health emergency with cases in more than 20 countries. Countries have scrambled to evacuate their nationals from Wuhan, with hundreds of US, Japanese, British, French and South Korean citizens evacuated so far, and more countries planning airlifts. A flight carrying more than 300 Indian nationals left Wuhan in the early hours of Saturday for New Delhi. About 200 US evacuees who landed in California on Wednesday have been put under a rare mandatory quarantine order for 14 days. US carriers American, United and Delta joined other airlines suspending flights to China, following the State Department travel advisory. Russia said it would evacuate more than 2,500 of its citizens holidaying on China's Hainan island, far from the epicentre of the outbreak, a day after sealing its remote far-eastern border.

SINGAPORE: Since it was first discovered last December in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the 2019 novel coronavirus has spread internationally. The rapid proliferation of the virus and the accompanying deaths have resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the outbreak to be a global health emergency. Governments all over the world have begun initiating various policies given the source of the virus. These have ranged from travel bans to quarantines of infected visitors – actions that protect countries from a potential community spread of the virus. PROBLEMATIC SENTIMENTS Reactions to the virus has been a mixture of fear and panic. The novel coronavirus has arguably been weaponised by some around the world to justify their racism against Chinese nationals and stoke communal tensions. More than 9,000 people in Canada had signed a petition last Wednesday (Jan 28) urging a district school board to bar students whose family members had recently travelled to China from entering the classroom. Canadians have also reportedly started to avoid Toronto’s Chinatown, with businesses in that area recording a slowdown.   Such measures could have more far-reaching societal consequences. In Canada and Britain, for instance, the outbreak has led to a rise of anti-Asian sentiments and discrimination, sparking fears among the Asian community that they would be targeted racially, as they had been during the 2003 outbreak of SARS. THE PUBLIC HEALTH CALCULATIONS Much has been said about the travel restrictions on Chinese nationals into Singapore and other countries, and whether these moves were potentially discriminatory. Hence, Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam’s explanation on Sunday that the restrictions are not based on nationality or passports but is geographic “in the sense that if you’ve been to China, whoever you are, then the restrictions kick in” is a useful clarification. The further announcement by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority on the nationalities of individuals who have been refused entry into Singapore since the start of the travel restrictions clarifies that the target of restrictions is anyone who might have been susceptible to the virus. Besides five Chinese passport-holders, 10 more – Spanish, British, American, Indian and Malaysians - have been refused entry because of their recent stay in China. The authorities have also made provisions for case-by-case exemptions for Chinese passport-holders who reside outside China and have not been there in the recent past. While there is a need to safeguard public health and enact exclusionary responses, authorities must also monitor cases of xenophobia.   These can exacerbate fault lines in Singapore. Already, there is some level of discomfort with those who originate from China. In the 2019 IPS-OnePeople.sg Indicators of Racial and Religious Harmony which surveyed over 4,000 Singaporean residents, about 20 per cent of Singaporeans were not comfortable with having a neighbour who was previously a Chinese national. One can expect that with the flooding of vitriolic remarks about Chinese nationals globally online driven by the novel coronavirus, there could be higher levels of discomfort. TACKLING ANTI-PRC SENTIMENTS Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, noting these anti-PRC sentiments reported elsewhere in the world, has declared on Saturday that this is “not quite the right approach to take”. Framing this as a medical issue, “an illness” and a virus that “can affect any human being”, he also pointed out that Chinese authorities did not wish it upon themselves and are taking measures to deal with the contagion. Referring to Singapore’s decision to restrict entry to new visitors of any nationality with recent travel history to mainland China, Mr Lee said it was a pre-emptive measure taken purely to protect Singapore’s public health.   It is important that our Prime Minister and other national leaders have taken a stand against such xenophobic reactions. What more can Singapore do to counter potential racism that stems from the novel coronavirus? First, we should work towards disassociating the virus from mainland Chinese. While the term “Wuhan virus” had been used commonly in past few weeks, possibly because we have precedents of associating diseases from where they originated (MERS is the acronym for Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome), it could feed prejudices against Chinese nationals. In this regard, it would be useful for health experts to popularise easy scientific equivalents and stay clear from such terms: A virus after all does not have a nationality but “2019 novel coronavirus” is a mouthful. Second, schools and community leaders should seek to build empathy for those infected around the world rather than allow people to be absorbed in hate towards Chinese nationals. We should consider how, if a similar virus had originated in Singapore, we would have felt had there been global disdain for all things Singaporean.   Third, individual responsibility for our words and deeds must also be taken. Netizens should offer support to those experiencing the crisis online and call out racist and discriminatory comments. As cases of local emissions emerged this week, members of Singapore society must keep in mind they have a role to play in stemming xenophobic sentiments. A harmonious and informed society is much needed to weather not only this health threat but also the other aspects of the novel coronavirus challenge that can have significant implications for Singapore.
